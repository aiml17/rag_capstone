The switch-up leads Sam and her father to try to reconcile their relationship as Sam finds her way as a leader. This show seems to suggest CBS is keeping to its mission to steadily showcase more diverse, complicated storylines.

At the genesis of their now 50 years of friendship and collaboration, six-time Grammy\u00ae Award-winner James Taylor and four-time Grammy\u00ae Award-winner Carole King, famously performed together in 1970 at The Troubadour, the storied Los Angeles club. The pair came together to reprise that concert for The Troubadour's own 50th anniversary in 2007.  As Taylor recalls in the film, those 2007 performances including \"So Far Away,\" \"I Feel the Earth Move,\" and \"You've Got a Friend,\" during six sold out concerts, were so much fun, that he and King hatched plans for a 2010 world tour.

          "I have no answer as to why the film wasn\u2019t released in 2011, but an appreciation of a musical collaboration that Rolling Stone magazine (and only Rolling Stone magazine) probably ranks really really high on some list of the greatest whatevers ever arrives better late than never.  The Gist: In 1970, Taylor and King performed their first concert together at the famed Troubadour club in Hollywood. It was the beginning of a beautiful \u2013 100 percent platonic! \u2013 friendship in which they made beautiful music together, and I\u2019m sorry for the cliches, but in this case, they\u2019re true. They sang each other\u2019s songs, encouraged and complemented each other, and harmonized like tea and honey. Forty years later, they decided to celebrate their convergence with a 50-plus-date tour, and now, 12 years after that, we get a celebration of the celebration, a remembrance of a remembrance that brought so much joy to so many people 52 years ago and then again 12 years ago, and now again a third time officially, with this movie. Just Call Out My Name opens with clips of late-night talk show hosts (Leno, Carson, Letterman) introducing Taylor or King or both, then a blip of Oprah praising Taylor, but what she thinks of King, NOBODY KNOWS.",

And not a moment too soon! The events of the film occurred long enough ago that it\u2019s essentially nostalgic about nostalgia about ubiquitous songs from the early 1970s.",
          "From here on out, there will be no point of view presented outside the King-Taylor circle, so the hell with context, let\u2019s get to the music, which comprises the bulk of the film. Cue a clip of King singing \u201cSo Far Away\u201d in the early 1970s, then seamlessly segueing to a 2010 performance of the same song, illustrating how her voice has aged from lovely to lovelier \u2013 but don\u2019t expect any more such thoughtful comparison or savvy editing, because from here on out, director Frank Marshall sticks with modern performances and brief snippets of backstage footage and interviews. So brace yourselves for the easy listening songs you may not be a fan of, but probably know well anyway: \u201cIt\u2019s Too Late,\u201d \u201cSweet Baby James,\u201d \u201cFire and Rain,\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve Got a Friend\u201d and many others. Behind the scenes, King and Taylor work out the set list, and share frustratingly brief anecdotes, e.g., the inspiration behind certain songs, or how King spent a decade of her career writing songs for others before Taylor recruited her to play piano for his band, and all but pushed her on stage to sing her own material. We meet their band for the Troubadour tour, the core members the very same musicians who backed them in 1970; they have tons of loving praise for King and Taylor, and offer a little insight into their dynamic.",
          "Kootch, Sklar, and Kunkel have been session musicians for a number of major musicians over the years and have been a part of their own band, The Section. The rest is history. Taylor and King discuss the challenges that come with performing an intimate show in an era. They decide to perform in a round and play towards everyone in the audience as the night goes on. If not for Taylor providing the inspiration, King might not have started writing songs for herself. Taylor first played the Troubadour in 1969. The historic Los Angeles music venue played home to so many famous bands over the years. I love the humor as the duo segues between songs. Hey, if you can\u2019t find the original set list, there are so many hits to choose from!\u201cShe wrote too many good songs,\u201d Taylor says about having a problem with their show. To which King quickly responds, \u201cAs did he.\u201dWhen it came to writing \u201cYou\u2019ve Got a Friend,\u201d Carole King didn\u2019t have any person in mind but it just came out of her on the piano.

The cast diversity is notable: Malcolm Kinglsey (Edwin Hodge) is a Black man from a wealthy, prominent family. Wealthy Black Americans aren't usually showcased on television. Malcolm is also a love interest for Sam, adding to the representation of interracial relationships on television. However, most of the diversity comes in the form of the secondary cast (Skye P.

          "Based on       1 parent review     GOOD SAM plays in the standard medical procedural sandbox, but there is a family drama twist. Samantha Griffith (Sophia Bush) is a competent heart surgeon who became the head of the department after her hard-to-please father, Dr. Rob Griffith (Jason Isaacs), suffered an accident, thereby losing his title as department head. The switch-up leads Sam and her father to try to reconcile their relationship as Sam finds her way as a leader. This show seems to suggest CBS is keeping to its mission to steadily showcase more diverse, complicated storylines. While Good Sam could have easily been just a run-of-the-mill medical show about a problem of the week, the series also entangles its characters in some thorny familial drama. This adds a new layer to what fans of this type of genre might be used to, and thankfully so. Bush, who once headlined another procedural, Chicago P.D., is great at playing a woman who has grown tired of trying to please her father and wants to show her worth as a doctor on her own terms. English actor Isaacs' American accent falters at the beginning of the first episode, but by the time it's ended, you believe he's a difficult man who might have a good heart, but is buried underneath guilt and unresolved trauma.",

Sophia Bush is back on TV for Good Sam, and here's how the CBS drama compares to other current medical shows. Spoilers ahead for the series premiere of Good Sam on CBS. CBS has officially gotten into the medical drama game with the debut of Good Sam, starring Sophia Bush in her big series regular return to network television after her exit from Chicago P.D. in 2017. As Dr. Sam Griffith, Bush \u2013\u00a0in her first turn playing a doctor on TV \u2013\u00a0takes on a leadership role at her hospital by becoming chief of surgery\u2026 with the complication that her father (played by Jason Isaacs) formerly held that position before ending up in a coma after being shot. When he awakes and must work under his daughter, there are more problems than just medical mysteries for Sam to deal with.\u00a0 The show packed a lot into the pilot episode to establish not only Sam and dad Rob \u201cGriff\u201d Griffith, but also her mom and her team of doctors who are used to following Griff\u2019s lead rather than Sam\u2019s. CBS was the only broadcast network without a medical drama prior to Good Sam, and recruiting a TV veteran like Sophia Bush and a big name like Jason Isaacs was a strong way to start. So, how does it compare to the other, long-running medical dramas on TV?",
          "Good Sam is an American medical drama television series created by Katie Wech for CBS, starring  Jason Isaacs and Sophia Bush which premiered on January 5, 2022.[1] In May 2022, the series was canceled after one season.[2]  Heart surgeon Dr. Samantha Griffith (Sophia Bush) becomes the top surgeon at  Lakeshore Sentinel Hospital after her boss and father, Dr. Rob Griffith (Jason Isaacs), falls into a coma.

          "Type keyword(s) to search  Pilot Script Review of Good Sam  Good Sam is CBS's only contender this year in the medical genre after passing on Under The Bridge last pilot season and ordering none the year before. It comes from in-house producer Jennie Snyder Urman, who created and executive produced Jane The Virgin. She currently serves as executive producer on the CW\u2019s Charmed and CBS\u2019s midseason sitcom Broke. The writer is Katie Wech, who previously worked with Urman as co-executive producer on Jane the Virgin. Prior to Good Sam, she wrote ABC's pilot The Hypnotist\u2019s Love Story, based on the Liane Moriarty book, which didn't make it to series for good reasons (read my script review). Most recently, she was one of the many writers hired for Fox\u2019s summer series BH90210. This is also the second year CBS has developed a drama pilot for Sophia Bush. In 2019, she headlined Surveillance, a suspenseful spy thriller (read my preview) which reportedly \"tested through the roof\" but was ultimately determined not to be a good fit for the network. Will Bush have better luck this time? Read on...

          "The only way to resume his job is as her subordinate, an arrangement which, for him, is untenable. Their interactions work, and Sophia Bush and Jason Isaacs seem like they could be a great pairing. The other characters around them fail to make much of an impression, except for Sam's mother and Griff's ex-wife, Vivian, who's an administrator at the hospital. Oh, and her new husband is also a doctor there. Adding to the intrigue, Sam's best friend Pippa sleeps with Griff! So, yes, there are some seriously intermingled lives at this hospital, and a fair number of twists in the pilot, but it's not clear where the show\u00a0goes from here, and/or whether CBS viewers will be invested enough in its characters to care. FINAL RECOMMENDATION: Good Sam is a solid pilot script with a fair number of twists. The father-daughter relationship at its heart is compelling, and Sophia Bush and Jason Isaacs seem well cast. That said, it doesn't feel like it brings much new to the medical show genre overall, and feels far more soapy than we've come to expect from CBS. It's not clear to me where it could fit in their schedule.

So, to celebrate the start of the summer season and to help spark some inspiration of what to do (or not do) on your next trip, we\u2019ve put together our list of the all-time best road-trip movies.\u00a0  Alright, so technically, this isn\u2019t a summer road-trip movie, considering it\u2019s one of the few films set during Thanksgiving, but it\u2019s still the all-time best buddy adventure film. Steve Martin and John Candy were a match made in Heaven, and the jokes still land over 30 years later. \u00a0 Little Miss Sunshine is a heartwarming indie comedy about a quirky family of misfits trying to get their daughter to a beauty pageant. It has an incredible soundtrack featuring Sufjan Stevens and stellar performances, including a burgeoning Steve Carell.",

          "If Kermit the Frog making his way to Hollywood by way of a swamp in Florida, meeting Fozzie, Gonzo, and Miss Piggy along the way, and featuring cameos by Steve Martin, Richard Pryor, and Mel Brooks doesn\u2019t do anything for you, then I just don\u2019t know what will. \u00a0 The Coen Brothers have had a number of hits, but this 1930s reimagining of The Odyssey is one of the most clever and original adventure comedies of all time. The cast is stacked, the cinematography is well-crafted, and the soundtrack will get stuck in your head all day. \u00a0 This one\u2019s basically just a modern update to Planes, Trains, and Automobiles, but Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifianakis still bring a lot of humor and even a little bit of heart. Plus, it was directed by Todd Philips, who made Joker, which is a very different and much darker film, making Due Date all the more interesting. \u00a0 Okay, yes, this one feels a little unorthodox; but when you think about it, \u2018The Wizard of Oz\u2019 is kind of the first cross-country adventure film ever made (not to mention the first one made in color). It might be required viewing if you plan on passing through Kansas. \u00a0 If you like 90s comedies, it doesn\u2019t get any better than\u00a0Dumb and Dumber.",

          "Inspired by the Karate Kid movies, Cobra Kai\u00a0reunites the Karate champions Johnny Lawrence and Daniel LaRusso. However, the stakes are high now as both of their children also get involved in martial arts tournaments. Just like their opposite karate styles, both men seem to have different approaches to parenting that are reflected in their children\u2019s actions. RELATED:\u00a05 Ways Johnny Is Cobra Kai's Hero (& 5 It's Still Daniel) This is how Cobra Kai feels thematically similar to The Good Sam. Sam wishes to walk in the professional footsteps of her father even though he has his own fallacies. How she seeks to reinvent herself in this context is what adds more substance to the premise.  A satire on the ultra-rich sections of American society, Succession deals with the internal conflicts of the Roy family. As the family's aging patriarch continues to thrive with an iron fist, his children devise to take the reins of his empire. Each of the main characters on Succession is delightfully selfish in their own ways. The result of their actions is a family drama of Shakespearean proportions.\u00a0 If people think Sam Griffith is a harsh dad, they should watch Logan Roy's outbursts at his children in Succession. The latter can be equally hot-headed and scheming, making Succession a treat for fans of well-written family dramas.",
          "At the nurses station, nurses DONNA (50s) and PAMELA (30s) are explaining to a patient how it crazy it can get here sometimes, just as SAMANTHA aka DR SAM (35) chases after MR FERGUSON, a disoriented patient who's refusing to be operated on. At the front entrance, Sam tries to reassure him as best she can. She tells him that Dr Griffith is the best surgeon around. That's when he decides to make a entrance, parking his Tesla in his VIP parking spot just next to the hospital entrance: Meet the handsome DR PAUL \"GRIFF\" GRIFFITH (50s), in all his glory. With Mr Ferguson still not convinced, Sam decides to show him the scar on her chest. She had heart surgery a long time ago. It saved her. There's hope for him, just as there was hope for her. Later that day, in pre-op, the patient is finally on the table. Griff arrives to do his magic. Meanwhile, Sam steps into an elevator when DR CALEB DE LUCA (30s) hops on. He kisses her. Apparently they're in a relationship. She tells him she's decided to take that job offer in Cleveland once she's finished her fellowship. Part of her decision clearly stems from her troubled relationship with Griff, who doesn't respect or value her the way she thinks he should.",

And on that note, this might be the most quotable movie of all time. \u00a0 Obviously, we couldn\u2019t make this list without Clark Griswald dragging his family to Wally World. While \u2018Christmas Vacation\u2019 is at the top of the series, this one still holds up as the all-time road-trip classic. It\u2019s over-the-top, hilarious, and a staple of the genre.

The 77th annual Citrus Bowl, the game featured the LSU Tigers of the Southeastern Conference (SEC) and the Purdue Boilermakers of the Big Ten Conference.[4][5] The game began at 1:08\u00a0p.m. EST[6] and was aired on ABC.[7] It was one of the 2022\u201323 bowl games concluding the 2022 FBS football season. LSU won 63-7.

            "ORLANDO, Fla. - LSU football certainly woke up feeling the cheesiest on Monday. The No. 16 Tigers (10-4) dominated Purdue (8-6) in the Cheez-It Citrus Bowl at Camping World Stadium, 63-7. LSU punted on its first drive and then proceeded to score touchdowns on its next six drives, finishing off the game with a 99-yard interception and score from safety Quad Wilson. A win heavily favored the Tigers after Purdue coach Jeff Brohm had left the Boilermakers for Louisville, star quarterback Aidan O'Connell and wide receiver Charlie Jones opted out of the game to prepare for the 2023 NFL Draft. Regardless, LSU played a nearly flawless game. The Tigers didn't allow any points until the fourth quarter, and by that time they were already up 49-0. Jayden Daniels and Garrett Nussmeier split reps at quarterback for most of the game until freshman Walker Howard finished off the game in the fourth quarter. With a double-digit win total to finish off coach Brian Kelly's first season, the Tigers can head into the 2023 campaign on a positive note, especially with Daniels and the vast majority of the offense returning. After scoring its first touchdown of the game, LSU made a surprising change. Nussmeier, despite Daniels being healthy and playing well on the last drive, replaced LSU's starter at quarterback.",

Here are the college football odds and trends for Purdue vs. LSU:\u00a0 With receivers Kayshon Boutte (NFL opt-out), Jaray Jenkins (NFL opt-out) and Jack Bech (transfer portal) also out, the Tigers will likely want to lean on the run game to ease the burden on quarterback Jayden Daniels. Junior running back Josh Williams is one player the Tigers can turn to. He leads the team's running backs with 97 carries for 532 yards (5.5 average) and is third with six touchdowns. Williams also has 21 receptions for 132 yards (6.3 average). He has rushed for 100 or more yards in three of the 11 games he's played in.",
            "His best game was an 18-carry, 118-yard and one-touchdown performance in a 13-10 win at Arkansas on Nov. 12. In the SEC title game against Georgia, he carried six times for 55 yards (9.2 average), including a 47-yarder. He has been hampered with an ankle injury. Among those leading the defense is senior linebacker Micah Baskerville. He leads the team in tackles with 83, including 39 solo, with one sack for six yards. He also has six pass breakups and one interception he returned for 29 yards and a touchdown. Baskerville has registered nine tackles in each of the last two games, including six solo against Georgia on Dec. 3. He was named to the Butkus Award Watch List for the 2022 season, and was LSU's top returning tackler after finishing second on the team with 83 a year ago. With the Boilermakers' top two pass catchers -- wide receiver Charlie Jones and tight end Payne Durham\u00a0-- declaring for the NFL Draft, junior wide out TJ\u00a0Sheffield will look to take advantage of a bigger role on the offense. Sheffield had 39 receptions for 424 yards (10.9 average) and three touchdowns during the regular season. In the Big Ten title game against Michigan, he caught four passes for 54 yards (13.5 average).",
            "The Tigers forced a turnover on downs to open the second half as senior linebacker Micah Baskerville nearly intercepted Burton on 4th-and-4 from the Purdue 45. Nabers found Daniels for a 5-yard touchdown pass on a trick play. That marked Nabers\u2019 second passing completion of the game, giving him 50 yards through the air and a touchdown to extend the Tigers\u2019 lead to 42-0. With the receiving score, Daniels also became the only LSU quarterback with a passing and receiving touchdown in the same game since at least World War II. Brooks picked off Alaimo at the Purdue 27 with 9:17 remaining in the third quarter. Nabers added to an already impressive day by taking a jet sweep from Nussmeier 75 yards for a touchdown, extending the LSU lead to 49-0 with 3:15 left in the third quarter. On the second play from scrimmage in the fourth quarter, the Boilermakers got on the board as Alaimo found Sheffield for a 16-yard touchdown to make it 49-7 Tigers. True freshman Walker Howard entered at quarterback for LSU, leading the offense to a seven play scoring drive, culminating in a 12-yard touchdown rush up the middle by Derrick Davis Jr. to extend the lead to 56-7.",
            "He immediately started showcasing his arm talent, taking a shot deep to Malik Nabers on his first throw of the game. Like Daniels, he finished the drive with a touchdown. Nussmeier completed 4-of-6 passes on the drive for 39 yards, most notably finding Mason Taylor on third down for 17 yards to get LSU into the red zone. Nussmeier rotated out for Daniels on the next drive which also led to a touchdown. But that drive wasn't his last, as Nussmeier finished the game with 173 passing yards and two touchdowns. His only error came in the third quarter when he threw an interception in the end zone that snapped LSU's six-touchdown streak. But regardless of the result, Nussmeier's early insertion into the game poses an interesting wrinkle for LSU's quarterback's room heading into spring practices. Without three starters on the defensive line and with little to no depth at wide receiver and cornerback, LSU had to shake up its rotations with some new faces even before the game got out of hand in the fourth quarter. On the defensive line, edge rusher Zavier Carter was featured on a few passing downs in the first half while linebacker Mike Jones Jr., who has played limited snaps in the second half of the season, played more with BJ Ojulari opting out for the NFL Draft and Desmond Little in the transfer portal.",

The Hawkeyes had their destiny in their own hands, with the ball and a timeout, starting at their 25, down 20-17, with 1:48 left to win the game. And the drive started with promise. Iowa advanced to the Kentucky 40 with 48 seconds left. But then, Spencer Petras threw an errant pass into the diving arms of DeAndre Square at the Wildcats' 26. Game over. Here's how it happened. That was just a heck of a drive by Kentucky, highlighted by Wan'Dale Robinson's 52-yard catch-and-run to give him 17 catches for 170 yards so far today. Chris Rodriguez Jr. finished off the eight-play, 80-yard drive with a 6-yard rushing score. Now, can Iowa's much-maligned offense, which has performed considerably better in the second half than it did the first, win the game for this defense? Also: Tyler Linderbaum is back in the game. Iowa went three-and-out. It tried to draw Kentucky offside on a fourth-and-1 but it didn't work so Tory Taylor punted.",

NMSU won a combined eight games in its previous four seasons, so Kill has executed an incredible turnaround in his first year on the job. Diego Pavia was the star of the bowl win. Pavia threw for 167 yards and two touchdowns and added 65 rushing yards in the win. He picked up several key third-down conversions with his legs in the second half to help his team secure the win. Southern Miss RB Frank Gore Jr.: Frank Gore Jr. ran wild in Southern Miss\u2019 win over Rice in the LendingTree Bowl.

The previous single-game bowl rushing record was 317 yards, but Gore surged past that with a 55-yard touchdown run in the final minutes. Southern Miss won a combined six games in 2020 and 2021, but the bowl win over Rice gave the Golden Eagles seven wins for the 2022 season. And with Gore and a significant chunk of this team\u2019s core expected to return, Southern Miss could be a team on the rise in the Sun Belt next season.

South Alabama was looking for its first-ever bowl win, but WKU jumped out to a 31-3 halftime lead and never looked back, putting up a total of 677 yards by the time the final seconds ticked off.

Losing 35-32 was still a cover for Oklahoma. But the loss also means that Oklahoma finishes the season at 6-7. That\u2019s the first losing season for OU since 1998. The first year of the Brent Venables era was a bit rocky \u2014 especially when you consider the success that Caleb Williams and Lincoln Riley had at USC. But there\u2019s no reason to panic in Norman. Yet. SMU: The Mustangs entered the New Mexico Bowl as 4.5-point favorites over a BYU team that started freshman third-string QB Sol-Jay Maiava-Peters for the first time. Yet BYU did just enough on the ground to eke out a 24-23 win after stopping an SMU two-point conversion with eight seconds left.",
          "Head coach Kirk Ferentz has kept things close to the vest with his signal-callers, but it's looking like Petras, who started the season as the starter and ended the season as the starter, will get the nod. Star running back Tyler Goodson opted out of the Citrus Bowl for the Hawkeyes as he prepares for the NFL Draft. Freshman receiver Keagan Johnson has also been ruled out for the Citrus Bowl.",
          "Georgia Southern: The Camellia Bowl was a painful watch if you were an Eagles fan. Buffalo beat Georgia Southern 23-21 after going 12-of-19 on third down while averaging less than three yards a carry. In addition to being unable to consistently stop Buffalo on third down, Georgia Southern players dropped multiple catchable passes. Kyle Vantrease threw for 352 yards on 45 attempts and hit Joshua Thompson on a 79-yard TD. But Georgia Southern never got the ball back after pulling within two with 3:38 to go because of two crucial third down conversions by the Bulls to run out the clock. Oklahoma State: The Cowboys entered the Guaranteed Rate Bowl as underdogs to Wisconsin, so OSU\u2019s 24-17 loss to the Badgers wasn\u2019t terribly surprising. But it\u2019s still worth noting just how poorly OSU finished the season. The Cowboys started the season 6-1 and finished 7-6 after ending the season on a 1-5 run. Yeah, Oklahoma State played the final two games of the season without QB Spencer Sanders, but the biggest culprit for the collapse was the regression of the defense in 2022. A testy Mike Gundy didn\u2019t want to talk about any potential staff changes after the game and we\u2019re not going to be surprised if there are some staff announcements forthcoming from OSU in the near future.",
          "Iowa QBs combined to throw for seven TDs all season while the defense itself scored six touchdowns. UCLA: UCLA had a meltdown in the Sun Bowl, blowing a 14-point lead in a loss to Pitt. The Bruins led 28-14 midway through the third quarter but allowed Pitt to come back and win 37-35 with a field goal in the final seconds. In his final college game, Dorian Thompson-Robinson threw three costly interceptions. Two came deep in Pitt territory and the third came deep in his own territory, giving the Panthers a short field to tie the game at 28-28 early in the fourth. To make matters worse, UCLA fumbled the ensuing kickoff to allow Pitt to take the lead. Later in the fourth, UCLA scored with 34 seconds to go to take a 35-34 lead. It looked like it would be the game-winner, but the defense allowed Pitt to go 46 yards in 30 seconds and kick the game-winning field goal. Brutal. UCLA has not won a bowl game since the 2014 season. Ole Miss: The Rebels had 11 drives that didn\u2019t end in points in a 42-25 loss to Texas Tech in the Texas Bowl. Ole Miss turned the ball over five times, gave up the ball five times on downs and punted once. While the Rebels were just 2-of-7 on fourth downs, Texas Tech was 5-of-6.",
          "Gavin Williams,\u00a0LeShon Williams and Arland Bruce IV\u00a0have taken the five total rushes and Spencer Petras is 3-for-5 for 18 yards so far. Nothing hideous. But nothing effective, either. Well, that was not very difficult. After Iowa's empty possession to start the day, Kentucky responded with a methodical 13-play, 80-yard scoring drive that ate up 7:28 of clock. Quarterback Will Levis capped it with a 5-yard touchdown pass to running back Chris Rodriguez Jr. The Wildcats converted on two third downs\u00a0\u2014 a third-and-3 at their 42 (they got a 5-yard run) and a third-and-4 at Iowa's 29 (they got a 14-yard completion). Nothing doing on the Hawkeyes' first possession. Spencer Petras started with a 12-yard completion to Sam LaPorta on the game's first play, but Iowa went three-and-out from there. Kentucky will take over at its 20 after Tory Taylor's punt went into the end zone. Spencer Petras was on the field for the first snap. Start question, answered. Looking for some pregame reading? Here's Register columnist Chad Leistikow with his prediction for the Citrus Bowl. There was a lot of talk about whether it'd\u00a0be Spencer Petras or Alex Padilla behind center for the Hawkeyes today.",
          "The freshman Maiava-Peters threw for just 47 yards and an interception but rushed 14 times for 96 yards while Christopher Brooks rushed 19 times for 88 yards. SMU didn\u2019t have receiver Rashee Rice but still had just 218 yards passing on 37 pass attempts. UTSA: The Roadrunners are still searching for their first bowl win after losing 18-12 to Troy in the Cure Bowl. It was an absolutely ugly performance from UTSA too. Without offensive coordinator Will Stein (now the OC at Oregon), the proficient UTSA offense committed five turnovers. The Roadrunners also had nine penalties for 104 yards and many of those penalties came at critical times. A win over the Trojans would have been a big boost to a UTSA team making a step up to the AAC in 2023. NC State: Dave Doeren's risk-averse decision-making may have cost his team a bowl win. NC State lost the Duke's Mayo Bowl 16-12. In the loss, Doeren decided to kick field goals twice inside the Maryland 10-yard line. In the first half, Doeren kicked on fourth-and-goal from the 2. And when his team trailed 13-9 midway through the fourth, Doeren sent his kicker out instead of going for it on fourth-and-3 from the 9.",
          "It\u2019s been a long time coming. Before Chris Creighton arrived as head coach in 2014, the 1987 California Bowl was the program\u2019s last bowl trip. Since then, Creighton brought the Eagles to five bowl games, but this year was the first time EMU pulled out the victory. With the win, EMU finished 9-4 for the season. That\u2019s the second-most wins in a season in program history. Kentucky: The Wildcats made sure that the Music City Bowl was going to hit the under in a 21-0 loss to Iowa. The total for the game was 31 and the lowest total for a bowl game in decades. It was also the lowest total of any game this season after Iowa and Minnesota had a pregame total of 31.5 in what turned out to be a 13-10 game. And just like that Iowa win, this game went under too. The two teams combined for fewer than 400 total yards and punted the ball 18 times with just 21 first downs between them. It was as ugly as an offensive performance as we all expected, especially from Kentucky. Freshman QB Destin Wade started in place of Will Levis and threw two pick sixes in the second quarter. The loss drops the Wildcats to 7-6 in what ultimately is a disappointing season while Iowa finishes at 8-5 despite its remarkable offensive futility throughout the season.",
          "The NC State offense struggled mightily all day, and that ended up being the final scoring opportunity of the game for NC State. San Diego State: The Aztecs turned the ball over five times in a 25-23 loss to Middle Tennessee in the Hawaii Bowl. The Blue Raiders had just 170 yards in the win and threw for 236 yards. Yes, you read that correctly. Thanks to sacks, MTSU had a remarkable -66 rushing yards on 30 attempts. And still won the game. SDSU QB Jalen Mayden threw three interceptions and also had a fumble. The Aztecs\u2019 final turnover came with 55 seconds to go on a 4th and 24 when Tyrell Shavers fumbled the ball after a 12-yard gain. Cincinnati: It was a listless performance for the Bearcats in a 24-7 loss to Louisville in the Fenway Bowl. Cincinnati had just 127 yards of total offense and allowed 419 yards to the Cardinals. Cincy got just 10 first downs and rushed for 44 yards on 38 attempts after sacks were factored in. Louisville even turned the ball over four times to Cincinnati\u2019s two and the game still wasn\u2019t close. If you didn\u2019t know any better, you would have assumed that Scott Satterfield had gone to a far worse team when he left Louisville for Cincy before the bowl game.",
          "He threw for 224 yards and ran for 73 more, including a gutsy 11-yard scramble that set up the game-winning field goal. UCLA took a 35-34 lead with 34 seconds remaining, but Patti quickly led the Panthers into field goal range, allowing Ben Sauls to boot his fourth field goal of the game. This one, a 47-yarder, was the game-winner. Pitt coach Pat Narduzzi has already indicated that Patti won't be back next season. So if that was Patti's final college game, he went out with a bang. Fresno State: After a 1-4 start, Fresno State closed out the season with nine consecutive wins. After beating Boise State in the Mountain West title game, the Bulldogs cruised past Washington State 29-6 in the LA Bowl to get to 10 wins for the fourth time in the last six seasons. In the process, Fresno State became the first team in FBS history to get to 10 wins after losing four of five to start the season. The LA Bowl was the final college game for Jake Haener and he went out in style. Haener threw for 280 yards and two touchdowns while Jordan Mims rushed out for 209 yards and had two scores of his own. Duke: Duke went from winless in ACC play in 2021 to nine wins in 2022.",
          "Duke capped off a remarkable season by beating UCF 30-13 on Wednesday in the Military Bowl \u2014 the program\u2019s first bowl win since 2018. With the win, Duke got to nine wins for the first time since 2014. Mike Elko has done one of the best coaching jobs in the country in his first season with the Blue Devils. The program was barely competitive in David Cutcliffe\u2019s final seasons on the job, going a combined 5-18 (1-17 ACC) in his final two years. With Wednesday\u2019s win, Duke finished the season 9-4 overall with a 5-3 mark in ACC play. It was just the third season in school history that the Blue Devils had finished with a winning conference record and won a bowl game. Washington: After going 4-8 in 2021, Washington capped off a tremendous turnaround by beating Texas 27-20 in the Alamo Bowl. With the win, Washington finished the season with 11 wins \u2014 the most it has had in a season since 2016. That's the year the Huskies reached the College Football Playoff. After coming over from Fresno State, head coach Kalen DeBoer was able to revitalize the program in just one season. The addition of quarterback Michael Penix Jr. played a big role. Penix, who will return next season, threw for 287 yards and two touchdowns in the bowl win.",

          "After a disastrous first play that saw Kentucky log a 10-yard run and get an extra 10 yards to Iowa's 11, the Hawkeye defense shored up and forced the Wildcats to settle for another field goal after they intercepted Patras at the 31. Spencer Petras' second-and-11 pass was tipped at the line of scrimmage and intercepted, and Kentucky will take over at Iowa's\u00a031-yard line. Oh dear ... that was painful for Hawkeye fans. Zach VanValkenburg and Joe Evans secured back-to-back sacks to force Kentucky into a third-and-26 from its 46-yard line. Then ... Will Levis connected with Wan'Dale Robinson for a 34-yard completion down the middle, right in the hole of Iowa's defense. The Hawkeyes were able to force the Wildcats into a 21-yard field goal, so that was a win. But still, not getting off the field on a third-and-24 is rough. It was another long, methodical drive\u00a0\u2014 14 plays, 72 yards, 8:15 of time. My goodness, it's hot down there. On-field temperatures are well above 100 degrees in Orlando, Florida, at Camping World Stadium for the Citrus Bowl. Not quite the 10-degree winter weather we're getting here in Iowa, eh? Iowa's offense showed some good things on a scoring drive that led to a 28-yard field goal from Caleb Shudak.",
          "The the offense responded with its best drive of the day, featuring a gorgeous 34-yard completion from Spencer Petras to Sam LaPorta and 27 hard-earned yards from Gavin Williams on three carries. But on a fourth-and-inches at Kentucky's 11, the Hawkeyes were aggressive and wanted the touchdown ... but Petras and Tyler Linderbaum couldn't connect on the snap and Petras fell on the ball behind the line of scrimmage. Seven plays, 69 yards ... no points. This stat from Register columnist Chad Leistikow is damning. The Hawkeyes were able to gain a few chunks of yards, to get close enough for a last-second Hail Mary from Spencer Petras. It was intercepted. To halftime we go, and the Wildcats start the second half with the ball. Petras went 10-for-16 for 82 yards and two interceptions. Gavin Williams led the backfield with five carries for 25 yards. This half has been pretty much all Kentucky, with the Wildcats out-possessing Iowa 19:22 to 10:38. They're also 4-for-7 on third-down attempts, while Iowa is 0-for-4. Another save from the Hawkeye defense.",
          "A hard play-action on second down, then a little screen to Sam LaPorta running behind Mason Richman and Tyler Linderbaum as lead blockers. It worked to perfection for a 36-yard touchdown pass. What a drive\u00a0\u2014 nine plays, 92 yards, 3:15 of clock. Iowa has looked like an entirely different team in this second half. Big plays from Jack Campbell spearheaded Iowa's defensive effort to stall Kentucky near midfield, and now the Hawkeyes take over at their 8-yard line, down 13-10. And Gavin Williams starts the drive with a 19-yard run. Can you say momentum swing? We've got ourselves a game, folks. Good things usually happen when Arland Bruce IV, who was an All-Iowa Elite Team running back in his senior season at Ankeny, gets the ball in the backfield. The true freshman capped a six-play, 50-yard drive with a 20-yard rushing score on a jet sweep, a play that's traditionally been kind to the Hawkeyes. LeShon Williams also logged two carries for 20 yards on that drive. Iowa already has 119 total yards in the second half, which nearly matches their whole first-half total. Iowa's defense came out of the half well and forced a Kentucky punt.",

            "ORLANDO, Fla. - LSU football certainly woke up feeling the cheesiest on Monday. The No. 16 Tigers (10-4) dominated Purdue (8-6) in the Cheez-It Citrus Bowl at Camping World Stadium, 63-7. LSU punted on its first drive and then proceeded to score touchdowns on its next six drives, finishing off the game with a 99-yard interception and score from safety Quad Wilson. A win heavily favored the Tigers after Purdue coach Jeff Brohm had left the Boilermakers for Louisville, star quarterback Aidan O'Connell and wide receiver Charlie Jones opted out of the game to prepare for the 2023 NFL Draft. Regardless, LSU played a nearly flawless game. The Tigers didn't allow any points until the fourth quarter, and by that time they were already up 49-0. Jayden Daniels and Garrett Nussmeier split reps at quarterback for most of the game until freshman Walker Howard finished off the game in the fourth quarter. With a double-digit win total to finish off coach Brian Kelly's first season, the Tigers can head into the 2023 campaign on a positive note, especially with Daniels and the vast majority of the offense returning. After scoring its first touchdown of the game, LSU made a surprising change. Nussmeier, despite Daniels being healthy and playing well on the last drive, replaced LSU's starter at quarterback.",

The model simulates every FBS college football game 10,000 times. Over the past six-plus years, the proprietary computer model has generated a stunning profit of almost $2,500 for $100 players on its top-rated college football picks against the spread. Anyone who has followed it has seen huge returns. Now, the model has set its sights on LSU vs. Purdue and just locked in its picks and Citrus Bowl 2023 predictions.

Junior running back Josh Williams is one player the Tigers can turn to. He leads the team's running backs with 97 carries for 532 yards (5.5 average) and is third with six touchdowns. Williams also has 21 receptions for 132 yards (6.3 average). He has rushed for 100 or more yards in three of the 11 games he's played in.",

In the SEC title game against Georgia, he carried six times for 55 yards (9.2 average), including a 47-yarder. He has been hampered with an ankle injury. Among those leading the defense is senior linebacker Micah Baskerville. He leads the team in tackles with 83, including 39 solo, with one sack for six yards. He also has six pass breakups and one interception he returned for 29 yards and a touchdown. Baskerville has registered nine tackles in each of the last two games, including six solo against Georgia on Dec. 3. He was named to the Butkus Award Watch List for the 2022 season, and was LSU's top returning tackler after finishing second on the team with 83 a year ago. With the Boilermakers' top two pass catchers -- wide receiver Charlie Jones and tight end Payne Durham\u00a0-- declaring for the NFL Draft, junior wide out TJ\u00a0Sheffield will look to take advantage of a bigger role on the offense. Sheffield had 39 receptions for 424 yards (10.9 average) and three touchdowns during the regular season. In the Big Ten title game against Michigan, he caught four passes for 54 yards (13.5 average).",

That marked Nabers\u2019 second passing completion of the game, giving him 50 yards through the air and a touchdown to extend the Tigers\u2019 lead to 42-0. With the receiving score, Daniels also became the only LSU quarterback with a passing and receiving touchdown in the same game since at least World War II. Brooks picked off Alaimo at the Purdue 27 with 9:17 remaining in the third quarter. Nabers added to an already impressive day by taking a jet sweep from Nussmeier 75 yards for a touchdown, extending the LSU lead to 49-0 with 3:15 left in the third quarter. On the second play from scrimmage in the fourth quarter, the Boilermakers got on the board as Alaimo found Sheffield for a 16-yard touchdown to make it 49-7 Tigers. True freshman Walker Howard entered at quarterback for LSU, leading the offense to a seven play scoring drive, culminating in a 12-yard touchdown rush up the middle by Derrick Davis Jr. to extend the lead to 56-7.",
            "He immediately started showcasing his arm talent, taking a shot deep to Malik Nabers on his first throw of the game. Like Daniels, he finished the drive with a touchdown. Nussmeier completed 4-of-6 passes on the drive for 39 yards, most notably finding Mason Taylor on third down for 17 yards to get LSU into the red zone. Nussmeier rotated out for Daniels on the next drive which also led to a touchdown. But that drive wasn't his last, as Nussmeier finished the game with 173 passing yards and two touchdowns. His only error came in the third quarter when he threw an interception in the end zone that snapped LSU's six-touchdown streak. But regardless of the result, Nussmeier's early insertion into the game poses an interesting wrinkle for LSU's quarterback's room heading into spring practices. Without three starters on the defensive line and with little to no depth at wide receiver and cornerback, LSU had to shake up its rotations with some new faces even before the game got out of hand in the fourth quarter. On the defensive line, edge rusher Zavier Carter was featured on a few passing downs in the first half while linebacker Mike Jones Jr., who has played limited snaps in the second half of the season, played more with BJ Ojulari opting out for the NFL Draft and Desmond Little in the transfer portal.",

Before going 7-6 in 2021, Oregon State had seven consecutive losing seasons. Now the Beavers are 17-9 over the past two seasons. And with Clemson transfer quarterback DJ Uiagalelei joining the program next season, the Beavers could be a trendy preseason pick to contend for the Pac-12 title. Florida State: The Seminoles have 10 wins in a season for the first time since 2016 after a 35-32 win over Oklahoma in the Cheez-It Bowl. Jordan Travis threw for 418 yards on 38 attempts while Johnny Wilson had eight catches for 202 yards. The Seminoles had 587 yards on 72 plays and won the game despite going 0-of-3 on fourth down attempts. It\u2019s the first bowl win for Florida State since 2017 and a huge boost for a program that will enter 2023 as the top challenger to Clemson in the ACC. Pitt QB Nick Patti: Nick Patti has been a backup at Pitt for the past five seasons but got a chance to start in the Sun Bowl vs. UCLA. He made it count. In just his third career start, Patti led the Panthers to an epic comeback win.",

          "The 2022 Vrbo Citrus Bowl was a heck of a great game, with momentum swings and thrilling, crunch-time drives from either team.\u00a0 But that matters very little to the Hawkeyes and their fans, who will fly back to Iowa with a 20-17 loss to Mark Stoops and the SEC's Kentucky. The Hawkeyes had their destiny in their own hands, with the ball and a timeout, starting at their 25, down 20-17, with 1:48 left to win the game. And the drive started with promise. Iowa advanced to the Kentucky 40 with 48 seconds left. But then, Spencer Petras threw an errant pass into the diving arms of DeAndre Square at the Wildcats' 26. Game over. Here's how it happened. That was just a heck of a drive by Kentucky, highlighted by Wan'Dale Robinson's 52-yard catch-and-run to give him 17 catches for 170 yards so far today. Chris Rodriguez Jr. finished off the eight-play, 80-yard drive with a 6-yard rushing score. Now, can Iowa's much-maligned offense, which has performed considerably better in the second half than it did the first, win the game for this defense? Also: Tyler Linderbaum is back in the game. Iowa went three-and-out. It tried to draw Kentucky offside on a fourth-and-1 but it didn't work so Tory Taylor punted.",
          "The Aggies opened the season 1-5 before closing out the year by winning six of seven to finish 7-6. NMSU won a combined eight games in its previous four seasons, so Kill has executed an incredible turnaround in his first year on the job. Diego Pavia was the star of the bowl win. Pavia threw for 167 yards and two touchdowns and added 65 rushing yards in the win. He picked up several key third-down conversions with his legs in the second half to help his team secure the win. Southern Miss RB Frank Gore Jr.: Frank Gore Jr. ran wild in Southern Miss\u2019 win over Rice in the LendingTree Bowl. Gore set an all-time bowl record with 329 yards on just 21 carries in the 38-24 win. Gore rushed for two touchdowns and also had an 18-yard touchdown catch. The previous single-game bowl rushing record was 317 yards, but Gore surged past that with a 55-yard touchdown run in the final minutes. Southern Miss won a combined six games in 2020 and 2021, but the bowl win over Rice gave the Golden Eagles seven wins for the 2022 season. And with Gore and a significant chunk of this team\u2019s core expected to return, Southern Miss could be a team on the rise in the Sun Belt next season. Eastern Michigan: With a win over San Jose State in the Potato Bowl, EMU notched its first bowl victory since 1987.",
          "Western Kentucky: WKU may have had the most impressive performance of bowl season. The Hilltoppers trounced South Alabama 44-23 in the New Orleans Bowl in a game that was not as close as the final score may indicate. South Alabama was looking for its first-ever bowl win, but WKU jumped out to a 31-3 halftime lead and never looked back, putting up a total of 677 yards by the time the final seconds ticked off. Austin Reed threw for 497 yards and four touchdowns in the win. Air Force: Air Force looked right at home on an incredibly cold night in Fort Worth. The Falcons ran all over Baylor in a 30-15 victory in the Armed Forces Bowl. Air Force rushed for 276 yards and limited Baylor to just 42 rushing yards. With the win, Air Force got to double-digit victories for the third time in four seasons. AFA went 11-2 in 2019 and 10-3 in the past two seasons. In the shortened 2020 season, the Falcons finished 3-3. As a program, Air Force has won four consecutive bowl games. New Mexico State: Year 1 of the Jerry Kill era at New Mexico State ended with a bowl victory. NMSU knocked off Bowling Green 24-19 in the Quick Lane Bowl on Monday to capture the program\u2019s second bowl victory since 1960.",
          "The game was a punt hater\u2019s dream. And it was a nightmare for Ole Miss QB Jaxson Dart. He threw three interceptions and fumbled once. Texas Tech QB Tyler Shough rushed for two TDs and threw for another as the Red Raiders easily held on to a 19-point halftime lead throughout the second half. The loss also meant that Ole Miss ends the season at 8-5 after starting the season 7-0. Oklahoma: The Sooners entered the Cheez-It Bowl shorthanded and as significant underdogs to Florida State. Losing 35-32 was still a cover for Oklahoma. But the loss also means that Oklahoma finishes the season at 6-7. That\u2019s the first losing season for OU since 1998. The first year of the Brent Venables era was a bit rocky \u2014 especially when you consider the success that Caleb Williams and Lincoln Riley had at USC. But there\u2019s no reason to panic in Norman. Yet. SMU: The Mustangs entered the New Mexico Bowl as 4.5-point favorites over a BYU team that started freshman third-string QB Sol-Jay Maiava-Peters for the first time. Yet BYU did just enough on the ground to eke out a 24-23 win after stopping an SMU two-point conversion with eight seconds left.",
          "Head coach Kirk Ferentz has kept things close to the vest with his signal-callers, but it's looking like Petras, who started the season as the starter and ended the season as the starter, will get the nod. Star running back Tyler Goodson opted out of the Citrus Bowl for the Hawkeyes as he prepares for the NFL Draft. Freshman receiver Keagan Johnson has also been ruled out for the Citrus Bowl.",
          "Georgia Southern: The Camellia Bowl was a painful watch if you were an Eagles fan. Buffalo beat Georgia Southern 23-21 after going 12-of-19 on third down while averaging less than three yards a carry. In addition to being unable to consistently stop Buffalo on third down, Georgia Southern players dropped multiple catchable passes. Kyle Vantrease threw for 352 yards on 45 attempts and hit Joshua Thompson on a 79-yard TD. But Georgia Southern never got the ball back after pulling within two with 3:38 to go because of two crucial third down conversions by the Bulls to run out the clock. Oklahoma State: The Cowboys entered the Guaranteed Rate Bowl as underdogs to Wisconsin, so OSU\u2019s 24-17 loss to the Badgers wasn\u2019t terribly surprising. But it\u2019s still worth noting just how poorly OSU finished the season. The Cowboys started the season 6-1 and finished 7-6 after ending the season on a 1-5 run. Yeah, Oklahoma State played the final two games of the season without QB Spencer Sanders, but the biggest culprit for the collapse was the regression of the defense in 2022. A testy Mike Gundy didn\u2019t want to talk about any potential staff changes after the game and we\u2019re not going to be surprised if there are some staff announcements forthcoming from OSU in the near future.",
          "Iowa QBs combined to throw for seven TDs all season while the defense itself scored six touchdowns. UCLA: UCLA had a meltdown in the Sun Bowl, blowing a 14-point lead in a loss to Pitt. The Bruins led 28-14 midway through the third quarter but allowed Pitt to come back and win 37-35 with a field goal in the final seconds. In his final college game, Dorian Thompson-Robinson threw three costly interceptions. Two came deep in Pitt territory and the third came deep in his own territory, giving the Panthers a short field to tie the game at 28-28 early in the fourth. To make matters worse, UCLA fumbled the ensuing kickoff to allow Pitt to take the lead. Later in the fourth, UCLA scored with 34 seconds to go to take a 35-34 lead. It looked like it would be the game-winner, but the defense allowed Pitt to go 46 yards in 30 seconds and kick the game-winning field goal. Brutal. UCLA has not won a bowl game since the 2014 season. Ole Miss: The Rebels had 11 drives that didn\u2019t end in points in a 42-25 loss to Texas Tech in the Texas Bowl. Ole Miss turned the ball over five times, gave up the ball five times on downs and punted once. While the Rebels were just 2-of-7 on fourth downs, Texas Tech was 5-of-6.",
          "Gavin Williams,\u00a0LeShon Williams and Arland Bruce IV\u00a0have taken the five total rushes and Spencer Petras is 3-for-5 for 18 yards so far. Nothing hideous. But nothing effective, either. Well, that was not very difficult. After Iowa's empty possession to start the day, Kentucky responded with a methodical 13-play, 80-yard scoring drive that ate up 7:28 of clock. Quarterback Will Levis capped it with a 5-yard touchdown pass to running back Chris Rodriguez Jr. The Wildcats converted on two third downs\u00a0\u2014 a third-and-3 at their 42 (they got a 5-yard run) and a third-and-4 at Iowa's 29 (they got a 14-yard completion). Nothing doing on the Hawkeyes' first possession. Spencer Petras started with a 12-yard completion to Sam LaPorta on the game's first play, but Iowa went three-and-out from there. Kentucky will take over at its 20 after Tory Taylor's punt went into the end zone. Spencer Petras was on the field for the first snap. Start question, answered. Looking for some pregame reading? Here's Register columnist Chad Leistikow with his prediction for the Citrus Bowl. There was a lot of talk about whether it'd\u00a0be Spencer Petras or Alex Padilla behind center for the Hawkeyes today.",
          "The freshman Maiava-Peters threw for just 47 yards and an interception but rushed 14 times for 96 yards while Christopher Brooks rushed 19 times for 88 yards. SMU didn\u2019t have receiver Rashee Rice but still had just 218 yards passing on 37 pass attempts. UTSA: The Roadrunners are still searching for their first bowl win after losing 18-12 to Troy in the Cure Bowl. It was an absolutely ugly performance from UTSA too. Without offensive coordinator Will Stein (now the OC at Oregon), the proficient UTSA offense committed five turnovers. The Roadrunners also had nine penalties for 104 yards and many of those penalties came at critical times. A win over the Trojans would have been a big boost to a UTSA team making a step up to the AAC in 2023. NC State: Dave Doeren's risk-averse decision-making may have cost his team a bowl win. NC State lost the Duke's Mayo Bowl 16-12. In the loss, Doeren decided to kick field goals twice inside the Maryland 10-yard line. In the first half, Doeren kicked on fourth-and-goal from the 2. And when his team trailed 13-9 midway through the fourth, Doeren sent his kicker out instead of going for it on fourth-and-3 from the 9.",
          "It\u2019s been a long time coming. Before Chris Creighton arrived as head coach in 2014, the 1987 California Bowl was the program\u2019s last bowl trip. Since then, Creighton brought the Eagles to five bowl games, but this year was the first time EMU pulled out the victory. With the win, EMU finished 9-4 for the season. That\u2019s the second-most wins in a season in program history. Kentucky: The Wildcats made sure that the Music City Bowl was going to hit the under in a 21-0 loss to Iowa. The total for the game was 31 and the lowest total for a bowl game in decades. It was also the lowest total of any game this season after Iowa and Minnesota had a pregame total of 31.5 in what turned out to be a 13-10 game. And just like that Iowa win, this game went under too. The two teams combined for fewer than 400 total yards and punted the ball 18 times with just 21 first downs between them. It was as ugly as an offensive performance as we all expected, especially from Kentucky. Freshman QB Destin Wade started in place of Will Levis and threw two pick sixes in the second quarter. The loss drops the Wildcats to 7-6 in what ultimately is a disappointing season while Iowa finishes at 8-5 despite its remarkable offensive futility throughout the season.",
          "The NC State offense struggled mightily all day, and that ended up being the final scoring opportunity of the game for NC State. San Diego State: The Aztecs turned the ball over five times in a 25-23 loss to Middle Tennessee in the Hawaii Bowl. The Blue Raiders had just 170 yards in the win and threw for 236 yards. Yes, you read that correctly. Thanks to sacks, MTSU had a remarkable -66 rushing yards on 30 attempts. And still won the game. SDSU QB Jalen Mayden threw three interceptions and also had a fumble. The Aztecs\u2019 final turnover came with 55 seconds to go on a 4th and 24 when Tyrell Shavers fumbled the ball after a 12-yard gain. Cincinnati: It was a listless performance for the Bearcats in a 24-7 loss to Louisville in the Fenway Bowl. Cincinnati had just 127 yards of total offense and allowed 419 yards to the Cardinals. Cincy got just 10 first downs and rushed for 44 yards on 38 attempts after sacks were factored in. Louisville even turned the ball over four times to Cincinnati\u2019s two and the game still wasn\u2019t close. If you didn\u2019t know any better, you would have assumed that Scott Satterfield had gone to a far worse team when he left Louisville for Cincy before the bowl game.",
          "He threw for 224 yards and ran for 73 more, including a gutsy 11-yard scramble that set up the game-winning field goal. UCLA took a 35-34 lead with 34 seconds remaining, but Patti quickly led the Panthers into field goal range, allowing Ben Sauls to boot his fourth field goal of the game. This one, a 47-yarder, was the game-winner. Pitt coach Pat Narduzzi has already indicated that Patti won't be back next season. So if that was Patti's final college game, he went out with a bang. Fresno State: After a 1-4 start, Fresno State closed out the season with nine consecutive wins. After beating Boise State in the Mountain West title game, the Bulldogs cruised past Washington State 29-6 in the LA Bowl to get to 10 wins for the fourth time in the last six seasons. In the process, Fresno State became the first team in FBS history to get to 10 wins after losing four of five to start the season. The LA Bowl was the final college game for Jake Haener and he went out in style. Haener threw for 280 yards and two touchdowns while Jordan Mims rushed out for 209 yards and had two scores of his own. Duke: Duke went from winless in ACC play in 2021 to nine wins in 2022.",
          "Duke capped off a remarkable season by beating UCF 30-13 on Wednesday in the Military Bowl \u2014 the program\u2019s first bowl win since 2018. With the win, Duke got to nine wins for the first time since 2014. Mike Elko has done one of the best coaching jobs in the country in his first season with the Blue Devils. The program was barely competitive in David Cutcliffe\u2019s final seasons on the job, going a combined 5-18 (1-17 ACC) in his final two years. With Wednesday\u2019s win, Duke finished the season 9-4 overall with a 5-3 mark in ACC play. It was just the third season in school history that the Blue Devils had finished with a winning conference record and won a bowl game. Washington: After going 4-8 in 2021, Washington capped off a tremendous turnaround by beating Texas 27-20 in the Alamo Bowl. With the win, Washington finished the season with 11 wins \u2014 the most it has had in a season since 2016. That's the year the Huskies reached the College Football Playoff. After coming over from Fresno State, head coach Kalen DeBoer was able to revitalize the program in just one season. The addition of quarterback Michael Penix Jr. played a big role. Penix, who will return next season, threw for 287 yards and two touchdowns in the bowl win.",

          "After a disastrous first play that saw Kentucky log a 10-yard run and get an extra 10 yards to Iowa's 11, the Hawkeye defense shored up and forced the Wildcats to settle for another field goal after they intercepted Patras at the 31. Spencer Petras' second-and-11 pass was tipped at the line of scrimmage and intercepted, and Kentucky will take over at Iowa's\u00a031-yard line. Oh dear ... that was painful for Hawkeye fans. Zach VanValkenburg and Joe Evans secured back-to-back sacks to force Kentucky into a third-and-26 from its 46-yard line. Then ... Will Levis connected with Wan'Dale Robinson for a 34-yard completion down the middle, right in the hole of Iowa's defense. The Hawkeyes were able to force the Wildcats into a 21-yard field goal, so that was a win. But still, not getting off the field on a third-and-24 is rough. It was another long, methodical drive\u00a0\u2014 14 plays, 72 yards, 8:15 of time. My goodness, it's hot down there. On-field temperatures are well above 100 degrees in Orlando, Florida, at Camping World Stadium for the Citrus Bowl. Not quite the 10-degree winter weather we're getting here in Iowa, eh? Iowa's offense showed some good things on a scoring drive that led to a 28-yard field goal from Caleb Shudak.",
          "The the offense responded with its best drive of the day, featuring a gorgeous 34-yard completion from Spencer Petras to Sam LaPorta and 27 hard-earned yards from Gavin Williams on three carries. But on a fourth-and-inches at Kentucky's 11, the Hawkeyes were aggressive and wanted the touchdown ... but Petras and Tyler Linderbaum couldn't connect on the snap and Petras fell on the ball behind the line of scrimmage. Seven plays, 69 yards ... no points. This stat from Register columnist Chad Leistikow is damning. The Hawkeyes were able to gain a few chunks of yards, to get close enough for a last-second Hail Mary from Spencer Petras. It was intercepted. To halftime we go, and the Wildcats start the second half with the ball. Petras went 10-for-16 for 82 yards and two interceptions. Gavin Williams led the backfield with five carries for 25 yards. This half has been pretty much all Kentucky, with the Wildcats out-possessing Iowa 19:22 to 10:38. They're also 4-for-7 on third-down attempts, while Iowa is 0-for-4. Another save from the Hawkeye defense.",
          "A hard play-action on second down, then a little screen to Sam LaPorta running behind Mason Richman and Tyler Linderbaum as lead blockers. It worked to perfection for a 36-yard touchdown pass. What a drive\u00a0\u2014 nine plays, 92 yards, 3:15 of clock. Iowa has looked like an entirely different team in this second half. Big plays from Jack Campbell spearheaded Iowa's defensive effort to stall Kentucky near midfield, and now the Hawkeyes take over at their 8-yard line, down 13-10. And Gavin Williams starts the drive with a 19-yard run. Can you say momentum swing? We've got ourselves a game, folks. Good things usually happen when Arland Bruce IV, who was an All-Iowa Elite Team running back in his senior season at Ankeny, gets the ball in the backfield. The true freshman capped a six-play, 50-yard drive with a 20-yard rushing score on a jet sweep, a play that's traditionally been kind to the Hawkeyes. LeShon Williams also logged two carries for 20 yards on that drive. Iowa already has 119 total yards in the second half, which nearly matches their whole first-half total. Iowa's defense came out of the half well and forced a Kentucky punt.",

            "ORLANDO, Fla. - LSU football certainly woke up feeling the cheesiest on Monday. The No. 16 Tigers (10-4) dominated Purdue (8-6) in the Cheez-It Citrus Bowl at Camping World Stadium, 63-7. LSU punted on its first drive and then proceeded to score touchdowns on its next six drives, finishing off the game with a 99-yard interception and score from safety Quad Wilson. A win heavily favored the Tigers after Purdue coach Jeff Brohm had left the Boilermakers for Louisville, star quarterback Aidan O'Connell and wide receiver Charlie Jones opted out of the game to prepare for the 2023 NFL Draft. Regardless, LSU played a nearly flawless game. The Tigers didn't allow any points until the fourth quarter, and by that time they were already up 49-0. Jayden Daniels and Garrett Nussmeier split reps at quarterback for most of the game until freshman Walker Howard finished off the game in the fourth quarter. With a double-digit win total to finish off coach Brian Kelly's first season, the Tigers can head into the 2023 campaign on a positive note, especially with Daniels and the vast majority of the offense returning. After scoring its first touchdown of the game, LSU made a surprising change. Nussmeier, despite Daniels being healthy and playing well on the last drive, replaced LSU's starter at quarterback.",

The Boilermakers (8-5, 6-3 Big Ten West) had a three-game winning streak snapped in the Big Ten Conference Championship Game. In that matchup, No. 2 Michigan rolled to a 43-22 win.

After forcing Purdue to punt, the Tigers were awarded an extra 15 yards after a kick-catch interference penalty was enforced. Gregory Clayton fair caught the football at the LSU 18 and the penalty moved the ball to the 33. Nussmeier entered at quarterback on LSU\u2019s third offensive possession of the game.

The model simulates every FBS college football game 10,000 times. Over the past six-plus years, the proprietary computer model has generated a stunning profit of almost $2,500 for $100 players on its top-rated college football picks against the spread. Anyone who has followed it has seen huge returns. Now, the model has set its sights on LSU vs. Purdue and just locked in its picks and Citrus Bowl 2023 predictions. You can visit SportsLine now to see the model's picks. Here are the college football odds and trends for Purdue vs. LSU:\u00a0 With receivers Kayshon Boutte (NFL opt-out), Jaray Jenkins (NFL opt-out) and Jack Bech (transfer portal) also out, the Tigers will likely want to lean on the run game to ease the burden on quarterback Jayden Daniels. Junior running back Josh Williams is one player the Tigers can turn to. He leads the team's running backs with 97 carries for 532 yards (5.5 average) and is third with six touchdowns. Williams also has 21 receptions for 132 yards (6.3 average). He has rushed for 100 or more yards in three of the 11 games he's played in.",
            "His best game was an 18-carry, 118-yard and one-touchdown performance in a 13-10 win at Arkansas on Nov. 12. In the SEC title game against Georgia, he carried six times for 55 yards (9.2 average), including a 47-yarder. He has been hampered with an ankle injury. Among those leading the defense is senior linebacker Micah Baskerville. He leads the team in tackles with 83, including 39 solo, with one sack for six yards. He also has six pass breakups and one interception he returned for 29 yards and a touchdown. Baskerville has registered nine tackles in each of the last two games, including six solo against Georgia on Dec. 3. He was named to the Butkus Award Watch List for the 2022 season, and was LSU's top returning tackler after finishing second on the team with 83 a year ago. With the Boilermakers' top two pass catchers -- wide receiver Charlie Jones and tight end Payne Durham\u00a0-- declaring for the NFL Draft, junior wide out TJ\u00a0Sheffield will look to take advantage of a bigger role on the offense. Sheffield had 39 receptions for 424 yards (10.9 average) and three touchdowns during the regular season. In the Big Ten title game against Michigan, he caught four passes for 54 yards (13.5 average).",
            "The Tigers forced a turnover on downs to open the second half as senior linebacker Micah Baskerville nearly intercepted Burton on 4th-and-4 from the Purdue 45. Nabers found Daniels for a 5-yard touchdown pass on a trick play. That marked Nabers\u2019 second passing completion of the game, giving him 50 yards through the air and a touchdown to extend the Tigers\u2019 lead to 42-0. With the receiving score, Daniels also became the only LSU quarterback with a passing and receiving touchdown in the same game since at least World War II. Brooks picked off Alaimo at the Purdue 27 with 9:17 remaining in the third quarter. Nabers added to an already impressive day by taking a jet sweep from Nussmeier 75 yards for a touchdown, extending the LSU lead to 49-0 with 3:15 left in the third quarter. On the second play from scrimmage in the fourth quarter, the Boilermakers got on the board as Alaimo found Sheffield for a 16-yard touchdown to make it 49-7 Tigers. True freshman Walker Howard entered at quarterback for LSU, leading the offense to a seven play scoring drive, culminating in a 12-yard touchdown rush up the middle by Derrick Davis Jr. to extend the lead to 56-7.",
            "He immediately started showcasing his arm talent, taking a shot deep to Malik Nabers on his first throw of the game. Like Daniels, he finished the drive with a touchdown. Nussmeier completed 4-of-6 passes on the drive for 39 yards, most notably finding Mason Taylor on third down for 17 yards to get LSU into the red zone. Nussmeier rotated out for Daniels on the next drive which also led to a touchdown. But that drive wasn't his last, as Nussmeier finished the game with 173 passing yards and two touchdowns. His only error came in the third quarter when he threw an interception in the end zone that snapped LSU's six-touchdown streak. But regardless of the result, Nussmeier's early insertion into the game poses an interesting wrinkle for LSU's quarterback's room heading into spring practices. Without three starters on the defensive line and with little to no depth at wide receiver and cornerback, LSU had to shake up its rotations with some new faces even before the game got out of hand in the fourth quarter. On the defensive line, edge rusher Zavier Carter was featured on a few passing downs in the first half while linebacker Mike Jones Jr., who has played limited snaps in the second half of the season, played more with BJ Ojulari opting out for the NFL Draft and Desmond Little in the transfer portal.",

          "The 2022 Vrbo Citrus Bowl was a heck of a great game, with momentum swings and thrilling, crunch-time drives from either team.\u00a0 But that matters very little to the Hawkeyes and their fans, who will fly back to Iowa with a 20-17 loss to Mark Stoops and the SEC's Kentucky. The Hawkeyes had their destiny in their own hands, with the ball and a timeout, starting at their 25, down 20-17, with 1:48 left to win the game. And the drive started with promise. Iowa advanced to the Kentucky 40 with 48 seconds left. But then, Spencer Petras threw an errant pass into the diving arms of DeAndre Square at the Wildcats' 26. Game over. Here's how it happened. That was just a heck of a drive by Kentucky, highlighted by Wan'Dale Robinson's 52-yard catch-and-run to give him 17 catches for 170 yards so far today. Chris Rodriguez Jr. finished off the eight-play, 80-yard drive with a 6-yard rushing score. Now, can Iowa's much-maligned offense, which has performed considerably better in the second half than it did the first, win the game for this defense? Also: Tyler Linderbaum is back in the game. Iowa went three-and-out. It tried to draw Kentucky offside on a fourth-and-1 but it didn't work so Tory Taylor punted.",
          "The Aggies opened the season 1-5 before closing out the year by winning six of seven to finish 7-6. NMSU won a combined eight games in its previous four seasons, so Kill has executed an incredible turnaround in his first year on the job. Diego Pavia was the star of the bowl win. Pavia threw for 167 yards and two touchdowns and added 65 rushing yards in the win. He picked up several key third-down conversions with his legs in the second half to help his team secure the win. Southern Miss RB Frank Gore Jr.: Frank Gore Jr. ran wild in Southern Miss\u2019 win over Rice in the LendingTree Bowl. Gore set an all-time bowl record with 329 yards on just 21 carries in the 38-24 win. Gore rushed for two touchdowns and also had an 18-yard touchdown catch. The previous single-game bowl rushing record was 317 yards, but Gore surged past that with a 55-yard touchdown run in the final minutes. Southern Miss won a combined six games in 2020 and 2021, but the bowl win over Rice gave the Golden Eagles seven wins for the 2022 season. And with Gore and a significant chunk of this team\u2019s core expected to return, Southern Miss could be a team on the rise in the Sun Belt next season. Eastern Michigan: With a win over San Jose State in the Potato Bowl, EMU notched its first bowl victory since 1987.",
          "Western Kentucky: WKU may have had the most impressive performance of bowl season. The Hilltoppers trounced South Alabama 44-23 in the New Orleans Bowl in a game that was not as close as the final score may indicate. South Alabama was looking for its first-ever bowl win, but WKU jumped out to a 31-3 halftime lead and never looked back, putting up a total of 677 yards by the time the final seconds ticked off. Austin Reed threw for 497 yards and four touchdowns in the win. Air Force: Air Force looked right at home on an incredibly cold night in Fort Worth. The Falcons ran all over Baylor in a 30-15 victory in the Armed Forces Bowl. Air Force rushed for 276 yards and limited Baylor to just 42 rushing yards. With the win, Air Force got to double-digit victories for the third time in four seasons. AFA went 11-2 in 2019 and 10-3 in the past two seasons. In the shortened 2020 season, the Falcons finished 3-3. As a program, Air Force has won four consecutive bowl games. New Mexico State: Year 1 of the Jerry Kill era at New Mexico State ended with a bowl victory. NMSU knocked off Bowling Green 24-19 in the Quick Lane Bowl on Monday to capture the program\u2019s second bowl victory since 1960.",
          "The game was a punt hater\u2019s dream. And it was a nightmare for Ole Miss QB Jaxson Dart. He threw three interceptions and fumbled once. Texas Tech QB Tyler Shough rushed for two TDs and threw for another as the Red Raiders easily held on to a 19-point halftime lead throughout the second half. The loss also meant that Ole Miss ends the season at 8-5 after starting the season 7-0. Oklahoma: The Sooners entered the Cheez-It Bowl shorthanded and as significant underdogs to Florida State. Losing 35-32 was still a cover for Oklahoma. But the loss also means that Oklahoma finishes the season at 6-7. That\u2019s the first losing season for OU since 1998. The first year of the Brent Venables era was a bit rocky \u2014 especially when you consider the success that Caleb Williams and Lincoln Riley had at USC. But there\u2019s no reason to panic in Norman. Yet. SMU: The Mustangs entered the New Mexico Bowl as 4.5-point favorites over a BYU team that started freshman third-string QB Sol-Jay Maiava-Peters for the first time. Yet BYU did just enough on the ground to eke out a 24-23 win after stopping an SMU two-point conversion with eight seconds left.",
          "Head coach Kirk Ferentz has kept things close to the vest with his signal-callers, but it's looking like Petras, who started the season as the starter and ended the season as the starter, will get the nod. Star running back Tyler Goodson opted out of the Citrus Bowl for the Hawkeyes as he prepares for the NFL Draft. Freshman receiver Keagan Johnson has also been ruled out for the Citrus Bowl.",
          "Georgia Southern: The Camellia Bowl was a painful watch if you were an Eagles fan. Buffalo beat Georgia Southern 23-21 after going 12-of-19 on third down while averaging less than three yards a carry. In addition to being unable to consistently stop Buffalo on third down, Georgia Southern players dropped multiple catchable passes. Kyle Vantrease threw for 352 yards on 45 attempts and hit Joshua Thompson on a 79-yard TD. But Georgia Southern never got the ball back after pulling within two with 3:38 to go because of two crucial third down conversions by the Bulls to run out the clock. Oklahoma State: The Cowboys entered the Guaranteed Rate Bowl as underdogs to Wisconsin, so OSU\u2019s 24-17 loss to the Badgers wasn\u2019t terribly surprising. But it\u2019s still worth noting just how poorly OSU finished the season. The Cowboys started the season 6-1 and finished 7-6 after ending the season on a 1-5 run. Yeah, Oklahoma State played the final two games of the season without QB Spencer Sanders, but the biggest culprit for the collapse was the regression of the defense in 2022. A testy Mike Gundy didn\u2019t want to talk about any potential staff changes after the game and we\u2019re not going to be surprised if there are some staff announcements forthcoming from OSU in the near future.",
          "Iowa QBs combined to throw for seven TDs all season while the defense itself scored six touchdowns. UCLA: UCLA had a meltdown in the Sun Bowl, blowing a 14-point lead in a loss to Pitt. The Bruins led 28-14 midway through the third quarter but allowed Pitt to come back and win 37-35 with a field goal in the final seconds. In his final college game, Dorian Thompson-Robinson threw three costly interceptions. Two came deep in Pitt territory and the third came deep in his own territory, giving the Panthers a short field to tie the game at 28-28 early in the fourth. To make matters worse, UCLA fumbled the ensuing kickoff to allow Pitt to take the lead. Later in the fourth, UCLA scored with 34 seconds to go to take a 35-34 lead. It looked like it would be the game-winner, but the defense allowed Pitt to go 46 yards in 30 seconds and kick the game-winning field goal. Brutal. UCLA has not won a bowl game since the 2014 season. Ole Miss: The Rebels had 11 drives that didn\u2019t end in points in a 42-25 loss to Texas Tech in the Texas Bowl. Ole Miss turned the ball over five times, gave up the ball five times on downs and punted once. While the Rebels were just 2-of-7 on fourth downs, Texas Tech was 5-of-6.",
          "Gavin Williams,\u00a0LeShon Williams and Arland Bruce IV\u00a0have taken the five total rushes and Spencer Petras is 3-for-5 for 18 yards so far. Nothing hideous. But nothing effective, either. Well, that was not very difficult. After Iowa's empty possession to start the day, Kentucky responded with a methodical 13-play, 80-yard scoring drive that ate up 7:28 of clock. Quarterback Will Levis capped it with a 5-yard touchdown pass to running back Chris Rodriguez Jr. The Wildcats converted on two third downs\u00a0\u2014 a third-and-3 at their 42 (they got a 5-yard run) and a third-and-4 at Iowa's 29 (they got a 14-yard completion). Nothing doing on the Hawkeyes' first possession. Spencer Petras started with a 12-yard completion to Sam LaPorta on the game's first play, but Iowa went three-and-out from there. Kentucky will take over at its 20 after Tory Taylor's punt went into the end zone. Spencer Petras was on the field for the first snap. Start question, answered. Looking for some pregame reading? Here's Register columnist Chad Leistikow with his prediction for the Citrus Bowl. There was a lot of talk about whether it'd\u00a0be Spencer Petras or Alex Padilla behind center for the Hawkeyes today.",
          "The freshman Maiava-Peters threw for just 47 yards and an interception but rushed 14 times for 96 yards while Christopher Brooks rushed 19 times for 88 yards. SMU didn\u2019t have receiver Rashee Rice but still had just 218 yards passing on 37 pass attempts. UTSA: The Roadrunners are still searching for their first bowl win after losing 18-12 to Troy in the Cure Bowl. It was an absolutely ugly performance from UTSA too. Without offensive coordinator Will Stein (now the OC at Oregon), the proficient UTSA offense committed five turnovers. The Roadrunners also had nine penalties for 104 yards and many of those penalties came at critical times. A win over the Trojans would have been a big boost to a UTSA team making a step up to the AAC in 2023. NC State: Dave Doeren's risk-averse decision-making may have cost his team a bowl win. NC State lost the Duke's Mayo Bowl 16-12. In the loss, Doeren decided to kick field goals twice inside the Maryland 10-yard line. In the first half, Doeren kicked on fourth-and-goal from the 2. And when his team trailed 13-9 midway through the fourth, Doeren sent his kicker out instead of going for it on fourth-and-3 from the 9.",
          "It\u2019s been a long time coming. Before Chris Creighton arrived as head coach in 2014, the 1987 California Bowl was the program\u2019s last bowl trip. Since then, Creighton brought the Eagles to five bowl games, but this year was the first time EMU pulled out the victory. With the win, EMU finished 9-4 for the season. That\u2019s the second-most wins in a season in program history. Kentucky: The Wildcats made sure that the Music City Bowl was going to hit the under in a 21-0 loss to Iowa. The total for the game was 31 and the lowest total for a bowl game in decades. It was also the lowest total of any game this season after Iowa and Minnesota had a pregame total of 31.5 in what turned out to be a 13-10 game. And just like that Iowa win, this game went under too. The two teams combined for fewer than 400 total yards and punted the ball 18 times with just 21 first downs between them. It was as ugly as an offensive performance as we all expected, especially from Kentucky. Freshman QB Destin Wade started in place of Will Levis and threw two pick sixes in the second quarter. The loss drops the Wildcats to 7-6 in what ultimately is a disappointing season while Iowa finishes at 8-5 despite its remarkable offensive futility throughout the season.",
          "The NC State offense struggled mightily all day, and that ended up being the final scoring opportunity of the game for NC State. San Diego State: The Aztecs turned the ball over five times in a 25-23 loss to Middle Tennessee in the Hawaii Bowl. The Blue Raiders had just 170 yards in the win and threw for 236 yards. Yes, you read that correctly. Thanks to sacks, MTSU had a remarkable -66 rushing yards on 30 attempts. And still won the game. SDSU QB Jalen Mayden threw three interceptions and also had a fumble. The Aztecs\u2019 final turnover came with 55 seconds to go on a 4th and 24 when Tyrell Shavers fumbled the ball after a 12-yard gain. Cincinnati: It was a listless performance for the Bearcats in a 24-7 loss to Louisville in the Fenway Bowl. Cincinnati had just 127 yards of total offense and allowed 419 yards to the Cardinals. Cincy got just 10 first downs and rushed for 44 yards on 38 attempts after sacks were factored in. Louisville even turned the ball over four times to Cincinnati\u2019s two and the game still wasn\u2019t close. If you didn\u2019t know any better, you would have assumed that Scott Satterfield had gone to a far worse team when he left Louisville for Cincy before the bowl game.",
          "He threw for 224 yards and ran for 73 more, including a gutsy 11-yard scramble that set up the game-winning field goal. UCLA took a 35-34 lead with 34 seconds remaining, but Patti quickly led the Panthers into field goal range, allowing Ben Sauls to boot his fourth field goal of the game. This one, a 47-yarder, was the game-winner. Pitt coach Pat Narduzzi has already indicated that Patti won't be back next season. So if that was Patti's final college game, he went out with a bang. Fresno State: After a 1-4 start, Fresno State closed out the season with nine consecutive wins. After beating Boise State in the Mountain West title game, the Bulldogs cruised past Washington State 29-6 in the LA Bowl to get to 10 wins for the fourth time in the last six seasons. In the process, Fresno State became the first team in FBS history to get to 10 wins after losing four of five to start the season. The LA Bowl was the final college game for Jake Haener and he went out in style. Haener threw for 280 yards and two touchdowns while Jordan Mims rushed out for 209 yards and had two scores of his own. Duke: Duke went from winless in ACC play in 2021 to nine wins in 2022.",
          "Duke capped off a remarkable season by beating UCF 30-13 on Wednesday in the Military Bowl \u2014 the program\u2019s first bowl win since 2018. With the win, Duke got to nine wins for the first time since 2014. Mike Elko has done one of the best coaching jobs in the country in his first season with the Blue Devils. The program was barely competitive in David Cutcliffe\u2019s final seasons on the job, going a combined 5-18 (1-17 ACC) in his final two years. With Wednesday\u2019s win, Duke finished the season 9-4 overall with a 5-3 mark in ACC play. It was just the third season in school history that the Blue Devils had finished with a winning conference record and won a bowl game. Washington: After going 4-8 in 2021, Washington capped off a tremendous turnaround by beating Texas 27-20 in the Alamo Bowl. With the win, Washington finished the season with 11 wins \u2014 the most it has had in a season since 2016. That's the year the Huskies reached the College Football Playoff. After coming over from Fresno State, head coach Kalen DeBoer was able to revitalize the program in just one season. The addition of quarterback Michael Penix Jr. played a big role. Penix, who will return next season, threw for 287 yards and two touchdowns in the bowl win.",

          "After a disastrous first play that saw Kentucky log a 10-yard run and get an extra 10 yards to Iowa's 11, the Hawkeye defense shored up and forced the Wildcats to settle for another field goal after they intercepted Patras at the 31. Spencer Petras' second-and-11 pass was tipped at the line of scrimmage and intercepted, and Kentucky will take over at Iowa's\u00a031-yard line. Oh dear ... that was painful for Hawkeye fans. Zach VanValkenburg and Joe Evans secured back-to-back sacks to force Kentucky into a third-and-26 from its 46-yard line. Then ... Will Levis connected with Wan'Dale Robinson for a 34-yard completion down the middle, right in the hole of Iowa's defense. The Hawkeyes were able to force the Wildcats into a 21-yard field goal, so that was a win. But still, not getting off the field on a third-and-24 is rough. It was another long, methodical drive\u00a0\u2014 14 plays, 72 yards, 8:15 of time. My goodness, it's hot down there. On-field temperatures are well above 100 degrees in Orlando, Florida, at Camping World Stadium for the Citrus Bowl. Not quite the 10-degree winter weather we're getting here in Iowa, eh? Iowa's offense showed some good things on a scoring drive that led to a 28-yard field goal from Caleb Shudak.",
          "The the offense responded with its best drive of the day, featuring a gorgeous 34-yard completion from Spencer Petras to Sam LaPorta and 27 hard-earned yards from Gavin Williams on three carries. But on a fourth-and-inches at Kentucky's 11, the Hawkeyes were aggressive and wanted the touchdown ... but Petras and Tyler Linderbaum couldn't connect on the snap and Petras fell on the ball behind the line of scrimmage. Seven plays, 69 yards ... no points. This stat from Register columnist Chad Leistikow is damning. The Hawkeyes were able to gain a few chunks of yards, to get close enough for a last-second Hail Mary from Spencer Petras. It was intercepted. To halftime we go, and the Wildcats start the second half with the ball. Petras went 10-for-16 for 82 yards and two interceptions. Gavin Williams led the backfield with five carries for 25 yards. This half has been pretty much all Kentucky, with the Wildcats out-possessing Iowa 19:22 to 10:38. They're also 4-for-7 on third-down attempts, while Iowa is 0-for-4. Another save from the Hawkeye defense.",
          "A hard play-action on second down, then a little screen to Sam LaPorta running behind Mason Richman and Tyler Linderbaum as lead blockers. It worked to perfection for a 36-yard touchdown pass. What a drive\u00a0\u2014 nine plays, 92 yards, 3:15 of clock. Iowa has looked like an entirely different team in this second half. Big plays from Jack Campbell spearheaded Iowa's defensive effort to stall Kentucky near midfield, and now the Hawkeyes take over at their 8-yard line, down 13-10. And Gavin Williams starts the drive with a 19-yard run. Can you say momentum swing? We've got ourselves a game, folks. Good things usually happen when Arland Bruce IV, who was an All-Iowa Elite Team running back in his senior season at Ankeny, gets the ball in the backfield. The true freshman capped a six-play, 50-yard drive with a 20-yard rushing score on a jet sweep, a play that's traditionally been kind to the Hawkeyes. LeShon Williams also logged two carries for 20 yards on that drive. Iowa already has 119 total yards in the second half, which nearly matches their whole first-half total. Iowa's defense came out of the half well and forced a Kentucky punt.",

At the genesis of their now 50 years of friendship and collaboration, six-time Grammy\u00ae Award-winner James Taylor and four-time Grammy\u00ae Award-winner Carole King, famously performed together in 1970 at The Troubadour, the storied Los Angeles club. The pair came together to reprise that concert for The Troubadour's own 50th anniversary in 2007.  As Taylor recalls in the film, those 2007 performances including \"So Far Away,\" \"I Feel the Earth Move,\" and \"You've Got a Friend,\" during six sold out concerts, were so much fun, that he and King hatched plans for a 2010 world tour.

          "From here on out, there will be no point of view presented outside the King-Taylor circle, so the hell with context, let\u2019s get to the music, which comprises the bulk of the film. Cue a clip of King singing \u201cSo Far Away\u201d in the early 1970s, then seamlessly segueing to a 2010 performance of the same song, illustrating how her voice has aged from lovely to lovelier \u2013 but don\u2019t expect any more such thoughtful comparison or savvy editing, because from here on out, director Frank Marshall sticks with modern performances and brief snippets of backstage footage and interviews. So brace yourselves for the easy listening songs you may not be a fan of, but probably know well anyway: \u201cIt\u2019s Too Late,\u201d \u201cSweet Baby James,\u201d \u201cFire and Rain,\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve Got a Friend\u201d and many others. Behind the scenes, King and Taylor work out the set list, and share frustratingly brief anecdotes, e.g., the inspiration behind certain songs, or how King spent a decade of her career writing songs for others before Taylor recruited her to play piano for his band, and all but pushed her on stage to sing her own material. We meet their band for the Troubadour tour, the core members the very same musicians who backed them in 1970; they have tons of loving praise for King and Taylor, and offer a little insight into their dynamic.",

The cast diversity is notable: Malcolm Kinglsey (Edwin Hodge) is a Black man from a wealthy, prominent family. Wealthy Black Americans aren't usually showcased on television. Malcolm is also a love interest for Sam, adding to the representation of interracial relationships on television. However, most of the diversity comes in the form of the secondary cast (Skye P.

          "Based on       1 parent review     GOOD SAM plays in the standard medical procedural sandbox, but there is a family drama twist. Samantha Griffith (Sophia Bush) is a competent heart surgeon who became the head of the department after her hard-to-please father, Dr. Rob Griffith (Jason Isaacs), suffered an accident, thereby losing his title as department head. The switch-up leads Sam and her father to try to reconcile their relationship as Sam finds her way as a leader. This show seems to suggest CBS is keeping to its mission to steadily showcase more diverse, complicated storylines. While Good Sam could have easily been just a run-of-the-mill medical show about a problem of the week, the series also entangles its characters in some thorny familial drama. This adds a new layer to what fans of this type of genre might be used to, and thankfully so. Bush, who once headlined another procedural, Chicago P.D., is great at playing a woman who has grown tired of trying to please her father and wants to show her worth as a doctor on her own terms. English actor Isaacs' American accent falters at the beginning of the first episode, but by the time it's ended, you believe he's a difficult man who might have a good heart, but is buried underneath guilt and unresolved trauma.",

Sophia Bush is back on TV for Good Sam, and here's how the CBS drama compares to other current medical shows. Spoilers ahead for the series premiere of Good Sam on CBS. CBS has officially gotten into the medical drama game with the debut of Good Sam, starring Sophia Bush in her big series regular return to network television after her exit from Chicago P.D. in 2017. As Dr. Sam Griffith, Bush \u2013\u00a0in her first turn playing a doctor on TV \u2013\u00a0takes on a leadership role at her hospital by becoming chief of surgery\u2026 with the complication that her father (played by Jason Isaacs) formerly held that position before ending up in a coma after being shot. When he awakes and must work under his daughter, there are more problems than just medical mysteries for Sam to deal with.\u00a0 The show packed a lot into the pilot episode to establish not only Sam and dad Rob \u201cGriff\u201d Griffith, but also her mom and her team of doctors who are used to following Griff\u2019s lead rather than Sam\u2019s. CBS was the only broadcast network without a medical drama prior to Good Sam, and recruiting a TV veteran like Sophia Bush and a big name like Jason Isaacs was a strong way to start. So, how does it compare to the other, long-running medical dramas on TV?",
          "Good Sam is an American medical drama television series created by Katie Wech for CBS, starring  Jason Isaacs and Sophia Bush which premiered on January 5, 2022.[1] In May 2022, the series was canceled after one season.[2]  Heart surgeon Dr. Samantha Griffith (Sophia Bush) becomes the top surgeon at  Lakeshore Sentinel Hospital after her boss and father, Dr. Rob Griffith (Jason Isaacs), falls into a coma. Her life becomes complicated when he awakens and wants to resume surgery, which means Samantha would be supervising him.[3]  On September 19, 2019, CBS put Good Sam into development.[22] Writer Katie Wech produced the series with Jennie Snyder Urman through her Sutton St. Productions and CBS Television Studios.  In February 2020, the series was given a pilot order, with further development paused during the COVID-19 pandemic.[23] On May 14, 2021, the show was given a series order.[24] On May 12, 2022, CBS canceled the series after one season.[2]  In February 2020, Sophia Bush was cast as lead role.[25] In March 2020, Jason Isaacs joined the main cast.[26] In January 2021, Skye P.

          "Type keyword(s) to search  Pilot Script Review of Good Sam  Good Sam is CBS's only contender this year in the medical genre after passing on Under The Bridge last pilot season and ordering none the year before. It comes from in-house producer Jennie Snyder Urman, who created and executive produced Jane The Virgin. She currently serves as executive producer on the CW\u2019s Charmed and CBS\u2019s midseason sitcom Broke. The writer is Katie Wech, who previously worked with Urman as co-executive producer on Jane the Virgin. Prior to Good Sam, she wrote ABC's pilot The Hypnotist\u2019s Love Story, based on the Liane Moriarty book, which didn't make it to series for good reasons (read my script review). Most recently, she was one of the many writers hired for Fox\u2019s summer series BH90210. This is also the second year CBS has developed a drama pilot for Sophia Bush. In 2019, she headlined Surveillance, a suspenseful spy thriller (read my preview) which reportedly \"tested through the roof\" but was ultimately determined not to be a good fit for the network. Will Bush have better luck this time? Read on...  WRITTEN BY: Katie Wech DRAFT DATE: 1/21/20 PAGE COUNT: 60 pages  SCRIPT SYNOPSIS: We open on Detroit's Henry Ford hospital, where we hear the beeping of a heart monitor and some heavy breathing.",
          "The only way to resume his job is as her subordinate, an arrangement which, for him, is untenable. Their interactions work, and Sophia Bush and Jason Isaacs seem like they could be a great pairing. The other characters around them fail to make much of an impression, except for Sam's mother and Griff's ex-wife, Vivian, who's an administrator at the hospital. Oh, and her new husband is also a doctor there. Adding to the intrigue, Sam's best friend Pippa sleeps with Griff! So, yes, there are some seriously intermingled lives at this hospital, and a fair number of twists in the pilot, but it's not clear where the show\u00a0goes from here, and/or whether CBS viewers will be invested enough in its characters to care. FINAL RECOMMENDATION: Good Sam is a solid pilot script with a fair number of twists. The father-daughter relationship at its heart is compelling, and Sophia Bush and Jason Isaacs seem well cast. That said, it doesn't feel like it brings much new to the medical show genre overall, and feels far more soapy than we've come to expect from CBS. It's not clear to me where it could fit in their schedule.

          "If Kermit the Frog making his way to Hollywood by way of a swamp in Florida, meeting Fozzie, Gonzo, and Miss Piggy along the way, and featuring cameos by Steve Martin, Richard Pryor, and Mel Brooks doesn\u2019t do anything for you, then I just don\u2019t know what will. \u00a0 The Coen Brothers have had a number of hits, but this 1930s reimagining of The Odyssey is one of the most clever and original adventure comedies of all time. The cast is stacked, the cinematography is well-crafted, and the soundtrack will get stuck in your head all day. \u00a0 This one\u2019s basically just a modern update to Planes, Trains, and Automobiles, but Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifianakis still bring a lot of humor and even a little bit of heart. Plus, it was directed by Todd Philips, who made Joker, which is a very different and much darker film, making Due Date all the more interesting. \u00a0 Okay, yes, this one feels a little unorthodox; but when you think about it, \u2018The Wizard of Oz\u2019 is kind of the first cross-country adventure film ever made (not to mention the first one made in color). It might be required viewing if you plan on passing through Kansas. \u00a0 If you like 90s comedies, it doesn\u2019t get any better than\u00a0Dumb and Dumber.",

          "Inspired by the Karate Kid movies, Cobra Kai\u00a0reunites the Karate champions Johnny Lawrence and Daniel LaRusso. However, the stakes are high now as both of their children also get involved in martial arts tournaments. Just like their opposite karate styles, both men seem to have different approaches to parenting that are reflected in their children\u2019s actions. RELATED:\u00a05 Ways Johnny Is Cobra Kai's Hero (& 5 It's Still Daniel) This is how Cobra Kai feels thematically similar to The Good Sam. Sam wishes to walk in the professional footsteps of her father even though he has his own fallacies. How she seeks to reinvent herself in this context is what adds more substance to the premise.  A satire on the ultra-rich sections of American society, Succession deals with the internal conflicts of the Roy family. As the family's aging patriarch continues to thrive with an iron fist, his children devise to take the reins of his empire. Each of the main characters on Succession is delightfully selfish in their own ways. The result of their actions is a family drama of Shakespearean proportions.\u00a0 If people think Sam Griffith is a harsh dad, they should watch Logan Roy's outbursts at his children in Succession. The latter can be equally hot-headed and scheming, making Succession a treat for fans of well-written family dramas.",
          "At the nurses station, nurses DONNA (50s) and PAMELA (30s) are explaining to a patient how it crazy it can get here sometimes, just as SAMANTHA aka DR SAM (35) chases after MR FERGUSON, a disoriented patient who's refusing to be operated on. At the front entrance, Sam tries to reassure him as best she can. She tells him that Dr Griffith is the best surgeon around. That's when he decides to make a entrance, parking his Tesla in his VIP parking spot just next to the hospital entrance: Meet the handsome DR PAUL \"GRIFF\" GRIFFITH (50s), in all his glory. With Mr Ferguson still not convinced, Sam decides to show him the scar on her chest. She had heart surgery a long time ago. It saved her. There's hope for him, just as there was hope for her. Later that day, in pre-op, the patient is finally on the table. Griff arrives to do his magic. Meanwhile, Sam steps into an elevator when DR CALEB DE LUCA (30s) hops on. He kisses her. Apparently they're in a relationship. She tells him she's decided to take that job offer in Cleveland once she's finished her fellowship. Part of her decision clearly stems from her troubled relationship with Griff, who doesn't respect or value her the way she thinks he should.",

While \u2018Christmas Vacation\u2019 is at the top of the series, this one still holds up as the all-time road-trip classic. It\u2019s over-the-top, hilarious, and a staple of the genre.

The 77th annual Citrus Bowl, the game featured the LSU Tigers of the Southeastern Conference (SEC) and the Purdue Boilermakers of the Big Ten Conference.[4][5] The game began at 1:08\u00a0p.m. EST[6] and was aired on ABC.[7] It was one of the 2022\u201323 bowl games concluding the 2022 FBS football season. LSU won 63-7.

            "ORLANDO, Fla. - LSU football certainly woke up feeling the cheesiest on Monday. The No. 16 Tigers (10-4) dominated Purdue (8-6) in the Cheez-It Citrus Bowl at Camping World Stadium, 63-7. LSU punted on its first drive and then proceeded to score touchdowns on its next six drives, finishing off the game with a 99-yard interception and score from safety Quad Wilson. A win heavily favored the Tigers after Purdue coach Jeff Brohm had left the Boilermakers for Louisville, star quarterback Aidan O'Connell and wide receiver Charlie Jones opted out of the game to prepare for the 2023 NFL Draft. Regardless, LSU played a nearly flawless game. The Tigers didn't allow any points until the fourth quarter, and by that time they were already up 49-0. Jayden Daniels and Garrett Nussmeier split reps at quarterback for most of the game until freshman Walker Howard finished off the game in the fourth quarter. With a double-digit win total to finish off coach Brian Kelly's first season, the Tigers can head into the 2023 campaign on a positive note, especially with Daniels and the vast majority of the offense returning. After scoring its first touchdown of the game, LSU made a surprising change. Nussmeier, despite Daniels being healthy and playing well on the last drive, replaced LSU's starter at quarterback.",

Here are the college football odds and trends for Purdue vs. LSU:\u00a0 With receivers Kayshon Boutte (NFL opt-out), Jaray Jenkins (NFL opt-out) and Jack Bech (transfer portal) also out, the Tigers will likely want to lean on the run game to ease the burden on quarterback Jayden Daniels. Junior running back Josh Williams is one player the Tigers can turn to. He leads the team's running backs with 97 carries for 532 yards (5.5 average) and is third with six touchdowns. Williams also has 21 receptions for 132 yards (6.3 average). He has rushed for 100 or more yards in three of the 11 games he's played in.",
            "His best game was an 18-carry, 118-yard and one-touchdown performance in a 13-10 win at Arkansas on Nov. 12. In the SEC title game against Georgia, he carried six times for 55 yards (9.2 average), including a 47-yarder. He has been hampered with an ankle injury. Among those leading the defense is senior linebacker Micah Baskerville. He leads the team in tackles with 83, including 39 solo, with one sack for six yards. He also has six pass breakups and one interception he returned for 29 yards and a touchdown. Baskerville has registered nine tackles in each of the last two games, including six solo against Georgia on Dec. 3. He was named to the Butkus Award Watch List for the 2022 season, and was LSU's top returning tackler after finishing second on the team with 83 a year ago. With the Boilermakers' top two pass catchers -- wide receiver Charlie Jones and tight end Payne Durham\u00a0-- declaring for the NFL Draft, junior wide out TJ\u00a0Sheffield will look to take advantage of a bigger role on the offense. Sheffield had 39 receptions for 424 yards (10.9 average) and three touchdowns during the regular season. In the Big Ten title game against Michigan, he caught four passes for 54 yards (13.5 average).",
            "The Tigers forced a turnover on downs to open the second half as senior linebacker Micah Baskerville nearly intercepted Burton on 4th-and-4 from the Purdue 45. Nabers found Daniels for a 5-yard touchdown pass on a trick play. That marked Nabers\u2019 second passing completion of the game, giving him 50 yards through the air and a touchdown to extend the Tigers\u2019 lead to 42-0. With the receiving score, Daniels also became the only LSU quarterback with a passing and receiving touchdown in the same game since at least World War II. Brooks picked off Alaimo at the Purdue 27 with 9:17 remaining in the third quarter. Nabers added to an already impressive day by taking a jet sweep from Nussmeier 75 yards for a touchdown, extending the LSU lead to 49-0 with 3:15 left in the third quarter. On the second play from scrimmage in the fourth quarter, the Boilermakers got on the board as Alaimo found Sheffield for a 16-yard touchdown to make it 49-7 Tigers. True freshman Walker Howard entered at quarterback for LSU, leading the offense to a seven play scoring drive, culminating in a 12-yard touchdown rush up the middle by Derrick Davis Jr. to extend the lead to 56-7.",
            "He immediately started showcasing his arm talent, taking a shot deep to Malik Nabers on his first throw of the game. Like Daniels, he finished the drive with a touchdown. Nussmeier completed 4-of-6 passes on the drive for 39 yards, most notably finding Mason Taylor on third down for 17 yards to get LSU into the red zone. Nussmeier rotated out for Daniels on the next drive which also led to a touchdown. But that drive wasn't his last, as Nussmeier finished the game with 173 passing yards and two touchdowns. His only error came in the third quarter when he threw an interception in the end zone that snapped LSU's six-touchdown streak. But regardless of the result, Nussmeier's early insertion into the game poses an interesting wrinkle for LSU's quarterback's room heading into spring practices. Without three starters on the defensive line and with little to no depth at wide receiver and cornerback, LSU had to shake up its rotations with some new faces even before the game got out of hand in the fourth quarter. On the defensive line, edge rusher Zavier Carter was featured on a few passing downs in the first half while linebacker Mike Jones Jr., who has played limited snaps in the second half of the season, played more with BJ Ojulari opting out for the NFL Draft and Desmond Little in the transfer portal.",

          "The 2022 Vrbo Citrus Bowl was a heck of a great game, with momentum swings and thrilling, crunch-time drives from either team.\u00a0 But that matters very little to the Hawkeyes and their fans, who will fly back to Iowa with a 20-17 loss to Mark Stoops and the SEC's Kentucky. The Hawkeyes had their destiny in their own hands, with the ball and a timeout, starting at their 25, down 20-17, with 1:48 left to win the game. And the drive started with promise. Iowa advanced to the Kentucky 40 with 48 seconds left. But then, Spencer Petras threw an errant pass into the diving arms of DeAndre Square at the Wildcats' 26. Game over. Here's how it happened. That was just a heck of a drive by Kentucky, highlighted by Wan'Dale Robinson's 52-yard catch-and-run to give him 17 catches for 170 yards so far today. Chris Rodriguez Jr. finished off the eight-play, 80-yard drive with a 6-yard rushing score. Now, can Iowa's much-maligned offense, which has performed considerably better in the second half than it did the first, win the game for this defense? Also: Tyler Linderbaum is back in the game. Iowa went three-and-out. It tried to draw Kentucky offside on a fourth-and-1 but it didn't work so Tory Taylor punted.",
          "The Aggies opened the season 1-5 before closing out the year by winning six of seven to finish 7-6. NMSU won a combined eight games in its previous four seasons, so Kill has executed an incredible turnaround in his first year on the job. Diego Pavia was the star of the bowl win. Pavia threw for 167 yards and two touchdowns and added 65 rushing yards in the win. He picked up several key third-down conversions with his legs in the second half to help his team secure the win. Southern Miss RB Frank Gore Jr.: Frank Gore Jr. ran wild in Southern Miss\u2019 win over Rice in the LendingTree Bowl. Gore set an all-time bowl record with 329 yards on just 21 carries in the 38-24 win. Gore rushed for two touchdowns and also had an 18-yard touchdown catch. The previous single-game bowl rushing record was 317 yards, but Gore surged past that with a 55-yard touchdown run in the final minutes. Southern Miss won a combined six games in 2020 and 2021, but the bowl win over Rice gave the Golden Eagles seven wins for the 2022 season. And with Gore and a significant chunk of this team\u2019s core expected to return, Southern Miss could be a team on the rise in the Sun Belt next season. Eastern Michigan: With a win over San Jose State in the Potato Bowl, EMU notched its first bowl victory since 1987.",
          "Western Kentucky: WKU may have had the most impressive performance of bowl season. The Hilltoppers trounced South Alabama 44-23 in the New Orleans Bowl in a game that was not as close as the final score may indicate. South Alabama was looking for its first-ever bowl win, but WKU jumped out to a 31-3 halftime lead and never looked back, putting up a total of 677 yards by the time the final seconds ticked off. Austin Reed threw for 497 yards and four touchdowns in the win. Air Force: Air Force looked right at home on an incredibly cold night in Fort Worth. The Falcons ran all over Baylor in a 30-15 victory in the Armed Forces Bowl. Air Force rushed for 276 yards and limited Baylor to just 42 rushing yards. With the win, Air Force got to double-digit victories for the third time in four seasons. AFA went 11-2 in 2019 and 10-3 in the past two seasons. In the shortened 2020 season, the Falcons finished 3-3. As a program, Air Force has won four consecutive bowl games.

          "The game was a punt hater\u2019s dream. And it was a nightmare for Ole Miss QB Jaxson Dart. He threw three interceptions and fumbled once. Texas Tech QB Tyler Shough rushed for two TDs and threw for another as the Red Raiders easily held on to a 19-point halftime lead throughout the second half. The loss also meant that Ole Miss ends the season at 8-5 after starting the season 7-0. Oklahoma: The Sooners entered the Cheez-It Bowl shorthanded and as significant underdogs to Florida State. Losing 35-32 was still a cover for Oklahoma. But the loss also means that Oklahoma finishes the season at 6-7. That\u2019s the first losing season for OU since 1998. The first year of the Brent Venables era was a bit rocky \u2014 especially when you consider the success that Caleb Williams and Lincoln Riley had at USC. But there\u2019s no reason to panic in Norman. Yet. SMU: The Mustangs entered the New Mexico Bowl as 4.5-point favorites over a BYU team that started freshman third-string QB Sol-Jay Maiava-Peters for the first time. Yet BYU did just enough on the ground to eke out a 24-23 win after stopping an SMU two-point conversion with eight seconds left.",
          "Head coach Kirk Ferentz has kept things close to the vest with his signal-callers, but it's looking like Petras, who started the season as the starter and ended the season as the starter, will get the nod. Star running back Tyler Goodson opted out of the Citrus Bowl for the Hawkeyes as he prepares for the NFL Draft. Freshman receiver Keagan Johnson has also been ruled out for the Citrus Bowl.",
          "Georgia Southern: The Camellia Bowl was a painful watch if you were an Eagles fan. Buffalo beat Georgia Southern 23-21 after going 12-of-19 on third down while averaging less than three yards a carry. In addition to being unable to consistently stop Buffalo on third down, Georgia Southern players dropped multiple catchable passes. Kyle Vantrease threw for 352 yards on 45 attempts and hit Joshua Thompson on a 79-yard TD. But Georgia Southern never got the ball back after pulling within two with 3:38 to go because of two crucial third down conversions by the Bulls to run out the clock. Oklahoma State: The Cowboys entered the Guaranteed Rate Bowl as underdogs to Wisconsin, so OSU\u2019s 24-17 loss to the Badgers wasn\u2019t terribly surprising. But it\u2019s still worth noting just how poorly OSU finished the season. The Cowboys started the season 6-1 and finished 7-6 after ending the season on a 1-5 run. Yeah, Oklahoma State played the final two games of the season without QB Spencer Sanders, but the biggest culprit for the collapse was the regression of the defense in 2022. A testy Mike Gundy didn\u2019t want to talk about any potential staff changes after the game and we\u2019re not going to be surprised if there are some staff announcements forthcoming from OSU in the near future.",
          "Iowa QBs combined to throw for seven TDs all season while the defense itself scored six touchdowns. UCLA: UCLA had a meltdown in the Sun Bowl, blowing a 14-point lead in a loss to Pitt. The Bruins led 28-14 midway through the third quarter but allowed Pitt to come back and win 37-35 with a field goal in the final seconds. In his final college game, Dorian Thompson-Robinson threw three costly interceptions. Two came deep in Pitt territory and the third came deep in his own territory, giving the Panthers a short field to tie the game at 28-28 early in the fourth. To make matters worse, UCLA fumbled the ensuing kickoff to allow Pitt to take the lead. Later in the fourth, UCLA scored with 34 seconds to go to take a 35-34 lead. It looked like it would be the game-winner, but the defense allowed Pitt to go 46 yards in 30 seconds and kick the game-winning field goal. Brutal. UCLA has not won a bowl game since the 2014 season. Ole Miss: The Rebels had 11 drives that didn\u2019t end in points in a 42-25 loss to Texas Tech in the Texas Bowl. Ole Miss turned the ball over five times, gave up the ball five times on downs and punted once. While the Rebels were just 2-of-7 on fourth downs, Texas Tech was 5-of-6.",
          "Gavin Williams,\u00a0LeShon Williams and Arland Bruce IV\u00a0have taken the five total rushes and Spencer Petras is 3-for-5 for 18 yards so far. Nothing hideous. But nothing effective, either. Well, that was not very difficult. After Iowa's empty possession to start the day, Kentucky responded with a methodical 13-play, 80-yard scoring drive that ate up 7:28 of clock. Quarterback Will Levis capped it with a 5-yard touchdown pass to running back Chris Rodriguez Jr. The Wildcats converted on two third downs\u00a0\u2014 a third-and-3 at their 42 (they got a 5-yard run) and a third-and-4 at Iowa's 29 (they got a 14-yard completion). Nothing doing on the Hawkeyes' first possession. Spencer Petras started with a 12-yard completion to Sam LaPorta on the game's first play, but Iowa went three-and-out from there. Kentucky will take over at its 20 after Tory Taylor's punt went into the end zone. Spencer Petras was on the field for the first snap. Start question, answered. Looking for some pregame reading? Here's Register columnist Chad Leistikow with his prediction for the Citrus Bowl. There was a lot of talk about whether it'd\u00a0be Spencer Petras or Alex Padilla behind center for the Hawkeyes today.",
          "The freshman Maiava-Peters threw for just 47 yards and an interception but rushed 14 times for 96 yards while Christopher Brooks rushed 19 times for 88 yards. SMU didn\u2019t have receiver Rashee Rice but still had just 218 yards passing on 37 pass attempts. UTSA: The Roadrunners are still searching for their first bowl win after losing 18-12 to Troy in the Cure Bowl. It was an absolutely ugly performance from UTSA too. Without offensive coordinator Will Stein (now the OC at Oregon), the proficient UTSA offense committed five turnovers. The Roadrunners also had nine penalties for 104 yards and many of those penalties came at critical times. A win over the Trojans would have been a big boost to a UTSA team making a step up to the AAC in 2023. NC State: Dave Doeren's risk-averse decision-making may have cost his team a bowl win. NC State lost the Duke's Mayo Bowl 16-12. In the loss, Doeren decided to kick field goals twice inside the Maryland 10-yard line. In the first half, Doeren kicked on fourth-and-goal from the 2. And when his team trailed 13-9 midway through the fourth, Doeren sent his kicker out instead of going for it on fourth-and-3 from the 9.",
          "It\u2019s been a long time coming. Before Chris Creighton arrived as head coach in 2014, the 1987 California Bowl was the program\u2019s last bowl trip. Since then, Creighton brought the Eagles to five bowl games, but this year was the first time EMU pulled out the victory. With the win, EMU finished 9-4 for the season. That\u2019s the second-most wins in a season in program history. Kentucky: The Wildcats made sure that the Music City Bowl was going to hit the under in a 21-0 loss to Iowa. The total for the game was 31 and the lowest total for a bowl game in decades. It was also the lowest total of any game this season after Iowa and Minnesota had a pregame total of 31.5 in what turned out to be a 13-10 game. And just like that Iowa win, this game went under too. The two teams combined for fewer than 400 total yards and punted the ball 18 times with just 21 first downs between them. It was as ugly as an offensive performance as we all expected, especially from Kentucky. Freshman QB Destin Wade started in place of Will Levis and threw two pick sixes in the second quarter. The loss drops the Wildcats to 7-6 in what ultimately is a disappointing season while Iowa finishes at 8-5 despite its remarkable offensive futility throughout the season.",
          "The NC State offense struggled mightily all day, and that ended up being the final scoring opportunity of the game for NC State. San Diego State: The Aztecs turned the ball over five times in a 25-23 loss to Middle Tennessee in the Hawaii Bowl. The Blue Raiders had just 170 yards in the win and threw for 236 yards. Yes, you read that correctly. Thanks to sacks, MTSU had a remarkable -66 rushing yards on 30 attempts. And still won the game. SDSU QB Jalen Mayden threw three interceptions and also had a fumble. The Aztecs\u2019 final turnover came with 55 seconds to go on a 4th and 24 when Tyrell Shavers fumbled the ball after a 12-yard gain. Cincinnati: It was a listless performance for the Bearcats in a 24-7 loss to Louisville in the Fenway Bowl. Cincinnati had just 127 yards of total offense and allowed 419 yards to the Cardinals. Cincy got just 10 first downs and rushed for 44 yards on 38 attempts after sacks were factored in. Louisville even turned the ball over four times to Cincinnati\u2019s two and the game still wasn\u2019t close. If you didn\u2019t know any better, you would have assumed that Scott Satterfield had gone to a far worse team when he left Louisville for Cincy before the bowl game.",
          "He threw for 224 yards and ran for 73 more, including a gutsy 11-yard scramble that set up the game-winning field goal. UCLA took a 35-34 lead with 34 seconds remaining, but Patti quickly led the Panthers into field goal range, allowing Ben Sauls to boot his fourth field goal of the game. This one, a 47-yarder, was the game-winner. Pitt coach Pat Narduzzi has already indicated that Patti won't be back next season. So if that was Patti's final college game, he went out with a bang. Fresno State: After a 1-4 start, Fresno State closed out the season with nine consecutive wins. After beating Boise State in the Mountain West title game, the Bulldogs cruised past Washington State 29-6 in the LA Bowl to get to 10 wins for the fourth time in the last six seasons. In the process, Fresno State became the first team in FBS history to get to 10 wins after losing four of five to start the season. The LA Bowl was the final college game for Jake Haener and he went out in style. Haener threw for 280 yards and two touchdowns while Jordan Mims rushed out for 209 yards and had two scores of his own. Duke: Duke went from winless in ACC play in 2021 to nine wins in 2022.",
          "Duke capped off a remarkable season by beating UCF 30-13 on Wednesday in the Military Bowl \u2014 the program\u2019s first bowl win since 2018. With the win, Duke got to nine wins for the first time since 2014. Mike Elko has done one of the best coaching jobs in the country in his first season with the Blue Devils. The program was barely competitive in David Cutcliffe\u2019s final seasons on the job, going a combined 5-18 (1-17 ACC) in his final two years. With Wednesday\u2019s win, Duke finished the season 9-4 overall with a 5-3 mark in ACC play. It was just the third season in school history that the Blue Devils had finished with a winning conference record and won a bowl game. Washington: After going 4-8 in 2021, Washington capped off a tremendous turnaround by beating Texas 27-20 in the Alamo Bowl. With the win, Washington finished the season with 11 wins \u2014 the most it has had in a season since 2016. That's the year the Huskies reached the College Football Playoff. After coming over from Fresno State, head coach Kalen DeBoer was able to revitalize the program in just one season. The addition of quarterback Michael Penix Jr. played a big role. Penix, who will return next season, threw for 287 yards and two touchdowns in the bowl win.",

          "After a disastrous first play that saw Kentucky log a 10-yard run and get an extra 10 yards to Iowa's 11, the Hawkeye defense shored up and forced the Wildcats to settle for another field goal after they intercepted Patras at the 31. Spencer Petras' second-and-11 pass was tipped at the line of scrimmage and intercepted, and Kentucky will take over at Iowa's\u00a031-yard line. Oh dear ... that was painful for Hawkeye fans. Zach VanValkenburg and Joe Evans secured back-to-back sacks to force Kentucky into a third-and-26 from its 46-yard line. Then ... Will Levis connected with Wan'Dale Robinson for a 34-yard completion down the middle, right in the hole of Iowa's defense. The Hawkeyes were able to force the Wildcats into a 21-yard field goal, so that was a win. But still, not getting off the field on a third-and-24 is rough. It was another long, methodical drive\u00a0\u2014 14 plays, 72 yards, 8:15 of time. My goodness, it's hot down there. On-field temperatures are well above 100 degrees in Orlando, Florida, at Camping World Stadium for the Citrus Bowl. Not quite the 10-degree winter weather we're getting here in Iowa, eh? Iowa's offense showed some good things on a scoring drive that led to a 28-yard field goal from Caleb Shudak.",
          "The the offense responded with its best drive of the day, featuring a gorgeous 34-yard completion from Spencer Petras to Sam LaPorta and 27 hard-earned yards from Gavin Williams on three carries. But on a fourth-and-inches at Kentucky's 11, the Hawkeyes were aggressive and wanted the touchdown ... but Petras and Tyler Linderbaum couldn't connect on the snap and Petras fell on the ball behind the line of scrimmage. Seven plays, 69 yards ... no points. This stat from Register columnist Chad Leistikow is damning. The Hawkeyes were able to gain a few chunks of yards, to get close enough for a last-second Hail Mary from Spencer Petras. It was intercepted. To halftime we go, and the Wildcats start the second half with the ball. Petras went 10-for-16 for 82 yards and two interceptions. Gavin Williams led the backfield with five carries for 25 yards. This half has been pretty much all Kentucky, with the Wildcats out-possessing Iowa 19:22 to 10:38. They're also 4-for-7 on third-down attempts, while Iowa is 0-for-4. Another save from the Hawkeye defense.",
          "A hard play-action on second down, then a little screen to Sam LaPorta running behind Mason Richman and Tyler Linderbaum as lead blockers. It worked to perfection for a 36-yard touchdown pass. What a drive\u00a0\u2014 nine plays, 92 yards, 3:15 of clock. Iowa has looked like an entirely different team in this second half. Big plays from Jack Campbell spearheaded Iowa's defensive effort to stall Kentucky near midfield, and now the Hawkeyes take over at their 8-yard line, down 13-10. And Gavin Williams starts the drive with a 19-yard run. Can you say momentum swing? We've got ourselves a game, folks. Good things usually happen when Arland Bruce IV, who was an All-Iowa Elite Team running back in his senior season at Ankeny, gets the ball in the backfield. The true freshman capped a six-play, 50-yard drive with a 20-yard rushing score on a jet sweep, a play that's traditionally been kind to the Hawkeyes. LeShon Williams also logged two carries for 20 yards on that drive. Iowa already has 119 total yards in the second half, which nearly matches their whole first-half total. Iowa's defense came out of the half well and forced a Kentucky punt.",

The model simulates every FBS college football game 10,000 times. Over the past six-plus years, the proprietary computer model has generated a stunning profit of almost $2,500 for $100 players on its top-rated college football picks against the spread. Anyone who has followed it has seen huge returns. Now, the model has set its sights on LSU vs. Purdue and just locked in its picks and Citrus Bowl 2023 predictions. You can visit SportsLine now to see the model's picks. Here are the college football odds and trends for Purdue vs. LSU:\u00a0 With receivers Kayshon Boutte (NFL opt-out), Jaray Jenkins (NFL opt-out) and Jack Bech (transfer portal) also out, the Tigers will likely want to lean on the run game to ease the burden on quarterback Jayden Daniels. Junior running back Josh Williams is one player the Tigers can turn to. He leads the team's running backs with 97 carries for 532 yards (5.5 average) and is third with six touchdowns. Williams also has 21 receptions for 132 yards (6.3 average). He has rushed for 100 or more yards in three of the 11 games he's played in.",
            "His best game was an 18-carry, 118-yard and one-touchdown performance in a 13-10 win at Arkansas on Nov. 12. In the SEC title game against Georgia, he carried six times for 55 yards (9.2 average), including a 47-yarder. He has been hampered with an ankle injury. Among those leading the defense is senior linebacker Micah Baskerville. He leads the team in tackles with 83, including 39 solo, with one sack for six yards. He also has six pass breakups and one interception he returned for 29 yards and a touchdown. Baskerville has registered nine tackles in each of the last two games, including six solo against Georgia on Dec. 3. He was named to the Butkus Award Watch List for the 2022 season, and was LSU's top returning tackler after finishing second on the team with 83 a year ago. With the Boilermakers' top two pass catchers -- wide receiver Charlie Jones and tight end Payne Durham\u00a0-- declaring for the NFL Draft, junior wide out TJ\u00a0Sheffield will look to take advantage of a bigger role on the offense. Sheffield had 39 receptions for 424 yards (10.9 average) and three touchdowns during the regular season. In the Big Ten title game against Michigan, he caught four passes for 54 yards (13.5 average).",
            "The Tigers forced a turnover on downs to open the second half as senior linebacker Micah Baskerville nearly intercepted Burton on 4th-and-4 from the Purdue 45. Nabers found Daniels for a 5-yard touchdown pass on a trick play. That marked Nabers\u2019 second passing completion of the game, giving him 50 yards through the air and a touchdown to extend the Tigers\u2019 lead to 42-0. With the receiving score, Daniels also became the only LSU quarterback with a passing and receiving touchdown in the same game since at least World War II. Brooks picked off Alaimo at the Purdue 27 with 9:17 remaining in the third quarter. Nabers added to an already impressive day by taking a jet sweep from Nussmeier 75 yards for a touchdown, extending the LSU lead to 49-0 with 3:15 left in the third quarter. On the second play from scrimmage in the fourth quarter, the Boilermakers got on the board as Alaimo found Sheffield for a 16-yard touchdown to make it 49-7 Tigers. True freshman Walker Howard entered at quarterback for LSU, leading the offense to a seven play scoring drive, culminating in a 12-yard touchdown rush up the middle by Derrick Davis Jr. to extend the lead to 56-7.",
            "He immediately started showcasing his arm talent, taking a shot deep to Malik Nabers on his first throw of the game. Like Daniels, he finished the drive with a touchdown. Nussmeier completed 4-of-6 passes on the drive for 39 yards, most notably finding Mason Taylor on third down for 17 yards to get LSU into the red zone. Nussmeier rotated out for Daniels on the next drive which also led to a touchdown. But that drive wasn't his last, as Nussmeier finished the game with 173 passing yards and two touchdowns. His only error came in the third quarter when he threw an interception in the end zone that snapped LSU's six-touchdown streak. But regardless of the result, Nussmeier's early insertion into the game poses an interesting wrinkle for LSU's quarterback's room heading into spring practices. Without three starters on the defensive line and with little to no depth at wide receiver and cornerback, LSU had to shake up its rotations with some new faces even before the game got out of hand in the fourth quarter. On the defensive line, edge rusher Zavier Carter was featured on a few passing downs in the first half while linebacker Mike Jones Jr., who has played limited snaps in the second half of the season, played more with BJ Ojulari opting out for the NFL Draft and Desmond Little in the transfer portal.",

Before going 7-6 in 2021, Oregon State had seven consecutive losing seasons. Now the Beavers are 17-9 over the past two seasons. And with Clemson transfer quarterback DJ Uiagalelei joining the program next season, the Beavers could be a trendy preseason pick to contend for the Pac-12 title. Florida State: The Seminoles have 10 wins in a season for the first time since 2016 after a 35-32 win over Oklahoma in the Cheez-It Bowl. Jordan Travis threw for 418 yards on 38 attempts while Johnny Wilson had eight catches for 202 yards. The Seminoles had 587 yards on 72 plays and won the game despite going 0-of-3 on fourth down attempts. It\u2019s the first bowl win for Florida State since 2017 and a huge boost for a program that will enter 2023 as the top challenger to Clemson in the ACC. Pitt QB Nick Patti: Nick Patti has been a backup at Pitt for the past five seasons but got a chance to start in the Sun Bowl vs. UCLA. He made it count. In just his third career start, Patti led the Panthers to an epic comeback win.",

          "The 2022 Vrbo Citrus Bowl was a heck of a great game, with momentum swings and thrilling, crunch-time drives from either team.\u00a0 But that matters very little to the Hawkeyes and their fans, who will fly back to Iowa with a 20-17 loss to Mark Stoops and the SEC's Kentucky. The Hawkeyes had their destiny in their own hands, with the ball and a timeout, starting at their 25, down 20-17, with 1:48 left to win the game. And the drive started with promise. Iowa advanced to the Kentucky 40 with 48 seconds left. But then, Spencer Petras threw an errant pass into the diving arms of DeAndre Square at the Wildcats' 26. Game over. Here's how it happened. That was just a heck of a drive by Kentucky, highlighted by Wan'Dale Robinson's 52-yard catch-and-run to give him 17 catches for 170 yards so far today. Chris Rodriguez Jr. finished off the eight-play, 80-yard drive with a 6-yard rushing score. Now, can Iowa's much-maligned offense, which has performed considerably better in the second half than it did the first, win the game for this defense? Also: Tyler Linderbaum is back in the game. Iowa went three-and-out. It tried to draw Kentucky offside on a fourth-and-1 but it didn't work so Tory Taylor punted.",
          "The Aggies opened the season 1-5 before closing out the year by winning six of seven to finish 7-6. NMSU won a combined eight games in its previous four seasons, so Kill has executed an incredible turnaround in his first year on the job. Diego Pavia was the star of the bowl win. Pavia threw for 167 yards and two touchdowns and added 65 rushing yards in the win. He picked up several key third-down conversions with his legs in the second half to help his team secure the win. Southern Miss RB Frank Gore Jr.: Frank Gore Jr. ran wild in Southern Miss\u2019 win over Rice in the LendingTree Bowl. Gore set an all-time bowl record with 329 yards on just 21 carries in the 38-24 win. Gore rushed for two touchdowns and also had an 18-yard touchdown catch. The previous single-game bowl rushing record was 317 yards, but Gore surged past that with a 55-yard touchdown run in the final minutes. Southern Miss won a combined six games in 2020 and 2021, but the bowl win over Rice gave the Golden Eagles seven wins for the 2022 season. And with Gore and a significant chunk of this team\u2019s core expected to return, Southern Miss could be a team on the rise in the Sun Belt next season. Eastern Michigan: With a win over San Jose State in the Potato Bowl, EMU notched its first bowl victory since 1987.",
          "Western Kentucky: WKU may have had the most impressive performance of bowl season. The Hilltoppers trounced South Alabama 44-23 in the New Orleans Bowl in a game that was not as close as the final score may indicate. South Alabama was looking for its first-ever bowl win, but WKU jumped out to a 31-3 halftime lead and never looked back, putting up a total of 677 yards by the time the final seconds ticked off. Austin Reed threw for 497 yards and four touchdowns in the win. Air Force: Air Force looked right at home on an incredibly cold night in Fort Worth. The Falcons ran all over Baylor in a 30-15 victory in the Armed Forces Bowl. Air Force rushed for 276 yards and limited Baylor to just 42 rushing yards. With the win, Air Force got to double-digit victories for the third time in four seasons. AFA went 11-2 in 2019 and 10-3 in the past two seasons. In the shortened 2020 season, the Falcons finished 3-3. As a program, Air Force has won four consecutive bowl games. New Mexico State: Year 1 of the Jerry Kill era at New Mexico State ended with a bowl victory. NMSU knocked off Bowling Green 24-19 in the Quick Lane Bowl on Monday to capture the program\u2019s second bowl victory since 1960.",
          "The game was a punt hater\u2019s dream. And it was a nightmare for Ole Miss QB Jaxson Dart. He threw three interceptions and fumbled once. Texas Tech QB Tyler Shough rushed for two TDs and threw for another as the Red Raiders easily held on to a 19-point halftime lead throughout the second half. The loss also meant that Ole Miss ends the season at 8-5 after starting the season 7-0. Oklahoma: The Sooners entered the Cheez-It Bowl shorthanded and as significant underdogs to Florida State. Losing 35-32 was still a cover for Oklahoma. But the loss also means that Oklahoma finishes the season at 6-7. That\u2019s the first losing season for OU since 1998. The first year of the Brent Venables era was a bit rocky \u2014 especially when you consider the success that Caleb Williams and Lincoln Riley had at USC. But there\u2019s no reason to panic in Norman. Yet. SMU: The Mustangs entered the New Mexico Bowl as 4.5-point favorites over a BYU team that started freshman third-string QB Sol-Jay Maiava-Peters for the first time. Yet BYU did just enough on the ground to eke out a 24-23 win after stopping an SMU two-point conversion with eight seconds left.",
          "Head coach Kirk Ferentz has kept things close to the vest with his signal-callers, but it's looking like Petras, who started the season as the starter and ended the season as the starter, will get the nod. Star running back Tyler Goodson opted out of the Citrus Bowl for the Hawkeyes as he prepares for the NFL Draft. Freshman receiver Keagan Johnson has also been ruled out for the Citrus Bowl.",
          "Georgia Southern: The Camellia Bowl was a painful watch if you were an Eagles fan. Buffalo beat Georgia Southern 23-21 after going 12-of-19 on third down while averaging less than three yards a carry. In addition to being unable to consistently stop Buffalo on third down, Georgia Southern players dropped multiple catchable passes. Kyle Vantrease threw for 352 yards on 45 attempts and hit Joshua Thompson on a 79-yard TD. But Georgia Southern never got the ball back after pulling within two with 3:38 to go because of two crucial third down conversions by the Bulls to run out the clock. Oklahoma State: The Cowboys entered the Guaranteed Rate Bowl as underdogs to Wisconsin, so OSU\u2019s 24-17 loss to the Badgers wasn\u2019t terribly surprising. But it\u2019s still worth noting just how poorly OSU finished the season. The Cowboys started the season 6-1 and finished 7-6 after ending the season on a 1-5 run. Yeah, Oklahoma State played the final two games of the season without QB Spencer Sanders, but the biggest culprit for the collapse was the regression of the defense in 2022. A testy Mike Gundy didn\u2019t want to talk about any potential staff changes after the game and we\u2019re not going to be surprised if there are some staff announcements forthcoming from OSU in the near future.",
          "Iowa QBs combined to throw for seven TDs all season while the defense itself scored six touchdowns. UCLA: UCLA had a meltdown in the Sun Bowl, blowing a 14-point lead in a loss to Pitt. The Bruins led 28-14 midway through the third quarter but allowed Pitt to come back and win 37-35 with a field goal in the final seconds. In his final college game, Dorian Thompson-Robinson threw three costly interceptions. Two came deep in Pitt territory and the third came deep in his own territory, giving the Panthers a short field to tie the game at 28-28 early in the fourth. To make matters worse, UCLA fumbled the ensuing kickoff to allow Pitt to take the lead. Later in the fourth, UCLA scored with 34 seconds to go to take a 35-34 lead. It looked like it would be the game-winner, but the defense allowed Pitt to go 46 yards in 30 seconds and kick the game-winning field goal. Brutal. UCLA has not won a bowl game since the 2014 season. Ole Miss: The Rebels had 11 drives that didn\u2019t end in points in a 42-25 loss to Texas Tech in the Texas Bowl. Ole Miss turned the ball over five times, gave up the ball five times on downs and punted once. While the Rebels were just 2-of-7 on fourth downs, Texas Tech was 5-of-6.",
          "Gavin Williams,\u00a0LeShon Williams and Arland Bruce IV\u00a0have taken the five total rushes and Spencer Petras is 3-for-5 for 18 yards so far. Nothing hideous. But nothing effective, either. Well, that was not very difficult. After Iowa's empty possession to start the day, Kentucky responded with a methodical 13-play, 80-yard scoring drive that ate up 7:28 of clock. Quarterback Will Levis capped it with a 5-yard touchdown pass to running back Chris Rodriguez Jr. The Wildcats converted on two third downs\u00a0\u2014 a third-and-3 at their 42 (they got a 5-yard run) and a third-and-4 at Iowa's 29 (they got a 14-yard completion). Nothing doing on the Hawkeyes' first possession. Spencer Petras started with a 12-yard completion to Sam LaPorta on the game's first play, but Iowa went three-and-out from there. Kentucky will take over at its 20 after Tory Taylor's punt went into the end zone. Spencer Petras was on the field for the first snap. Start question, answered. Looking for some pregame reading? Here's Register columnist Chad Leistikow with his prediction for the Citrus Bowl. There was a lot of talk about whether it'd\u00a0be Spencer Petras or Alex Padilla behind center for the Hawkeyes today.",
          "The freshman Maiava-Peters threw for just 47 yards and an interception but rushed 14 times for 96 yards while Christopher Brooks rushed 19 times for 88 yards. SMU didn\u2019t have receiver Rashee Rice but still had just 218 yards passing on 37 pass attempts. UTSA: The Roadrunners are still searching for their first bowl win after losing 18-12 to Troy in the Cure Bowl. It was an absolutely ugly performance from UTSA too. Without offensive coordinator Will Stein (now the OC at Oregon), the proficient UTSA offense committed five turnovers. The Roadrunners also had nine penalties for 104 yards and many of those penalties came at critical times. A win over the Trojans would have been a big boost to a UTSA team making a step up to the AAC in 2023. NC State: Dave Doeren's risk-averse decision-making may have cost his team a bowl win. NC State lost the Duke's Mayo Bowl 16-12. In the loss, Doeren decided to kick field goals twice inside the Maryland 10-yard line. In the first half, Doeren kicked on fourth-and-goal from the 2. And when his team trailed 13-9 midway through the fourth, Doeren sent his kicker out instead of going for it on fourth-and-3 from the 9.",
          "It\u2019s been a long time coming. Before Chris Creighton arrived as head coach in 2014, the 1987 California Bowl was the program\u2019s last bowl trip. Since then, Creighton brought the Eagles to five bowl games, but this year was the first time EMU pulled out the victory. With the win, EMU finished 9-4 for the season. That\u2019s the second-most wins in a season in program history. Kentucky: The Wildcats made sure that the Music City Bowl was going to hit the under in a 21-0 loss to Iowa. The total for the game was 31 and the lowest total for a bowl game in decades. It was also the lowest total of any game this season after Iowa and Minnesota had a pregame total of 31.5 in what turned out to be a 13-10 game. And just like that Iowa win, this game went under too. The two teams combined for fewer than 400 total yards and punted the ball 18 times with just 21 first downs between them. It was as ugly as an offensive performance as we all expected, especially from Kentucky. Freshman QB Destin Wade started in place of Will Levis and threw two pick sixes in the second quarter. The loss drops the Wildcats to 7-6 in what ultimately is a disappointing season while Iowa finishes at 8-5 despite its remarkable offensive futility throughout the season.",
          "The NC State offense struggled mightily all day, and that ended up being the final scoring opportunity of the game for NC State. San Diego State: The Aztecs turned the ball over five times in a 25-23 loss to Middle Tennessee in the Hawaii Bowl. The Blue Raiders had just 170 yards in the win and threw for 236 yards. Yes, you read that correctly. Thanks to sacks, MTSU had a remarkable -66 rushing yards on 30 attempts. And still won the game. SDSU QB Jalen Mayden threw three interceptions and also had a fumble. The Aztecs\u2019 final turnover came with 55 seconds to go on a 4th and 24 when Tyrell Shavers fumbled the ball after a 12-yard gain. Cincinnati: It was a listless performance for the Bearcats in a 24-7 loss to Louisville in the Fenway Bowl. Cincinnati had just 127 yards of total offense and allowed 419 yards to the Cardinals. Cincy got just 10 first downs and rushed for 44 yards on 38 attempts after sacks were factored in. Louisville even turned the ball over four times to Cincinnati\u2019s two and the game still wasn\u2019t close. If you didn\u2019t know any better, you would have assumed that Scott Satterfield had gone to a far worse team when he left Louisville for Cincy before the bowl game.",
          "He threw for 224 yards and ran for 73 more, including a gutsy 11-yard scramble that set up the game-winning field goal. UCLA took a 35-34 lead with 34 seconds remaining, but Patti quickly led the Panthers into field goal range, allowing Ben Sauls to boot his fourth field goal of the game. This one, a 47-yarder, was the game-winner. Pitt coach Pat Narduzzi has already indicated that Patti won't be back next season. So if that was Patti's final college game, he went out with a bang. Fresno State: After a 1-4 start, Fresno State closed out the season with nine consecutive wins. After beating Boise State in the Mountain West title game, the Bulldogs cruised past Washington State 29-6 in the LA Bowl to get to 10 wins for the fourth time in the last six seasons. In the process, Fresno State became the first team in FBS history to get to 10 wins after losing four of five to start the season. The LA Bowl was the final college game for Jake Haener and he went out in style. Haener threw for 280 yards and two touchdowns while Jordan Mims rushed out for 209 yards and had two scores of his own. Duke: Duke went from winless in ACC play in 2021 to nine wins in 2022.",
          "Duke capped off a remarkable season by beating UCF 30-13 on Wednesday in the Military Bowl \u2014 the program\u2019s first bowl win since 2018. With the win, Duke got to nine wins for the first time since 2014. Mike Elko has done one of the best coaching jobs in the country in his first season with the Blue Devils. The program was barely competitive in David Cutcliffe\u2019s final seasons on the job, going a combined 5-18 (1-17 ACC) in his final two years. With Wednesday\u2019s win, Duke finished the season 9-4 overall with a 5-3 mark in ACC play. It was just the third season in school history that the Blue Devils had finished with a winning conference record and won a bowl game. Washington: After going 4-8 in 2021, Washington capped off a tremendous turnaround by beating Texas 27-20 in the Alamo Bowl. With the win, Washington finished the season with 11 wins \u2014 the most it has had in a season since 2016. That's the year the Huskies reached the College Football Playoff. After coming over from Fresno State, head coach Kalen DeBoer was able to revitalize the program in just one season. The addition of quarterback Michael Penix Jr. played a big role. Penix, who will return next season, threw for 287 yards and two touchdowns in the bowl win.",

          "After a disastrous first play that saw Kentucky log a 10-yard run and get an extra 10 yards to Iowa's 11, the Hawkeye defense shored up and forced the Wildcats to settle for another field goal after they intercepted Patras at the 31. Spencer Petras' second-and-11 pass was tipped at the line of scrimmage and intercepted, and Kentucky will take over at Iowa's\u00a031-yard line. Oh dear ... that was painful for Hawkeye fans. Zach VanValkenburg and Joe Evans secured back-to-back sacks to force Kentucky into a third-and-26 from its 46-yard line. Then ... Will Levis connected with Wan'Dale Robinson for a 34-yard completion down the middle, right in the hole of Iowa's defense. The Hawkeyes were able to force the Wildcats into a 21-yard field goal, so that was a win. But still, not getting off the field on a third-and-24 is rough. It was another long, methodical drive\u00a0\u2014 14 plays, 72 yards, 8:15 of time. My goodness, it's hot down there. On-field temperatures are well above 100 degrees in Orlando, Florida, at Camping World Stadium for the Citrus Bowl. Not quite the 10-degree winter weather we're getting here in Iowa, eh? Iowa's offense showed some good things on a scoring drive that led to a 28-yard field goal from Caleb Shudak.",
          "The the offense responded with its best drive of the day, featuring a gorgeous 34-yard completion from Spencer Petras to Sam LaPorta and 27 hard-earned yards from Gavin Williams on three carries. But on a fourth-and-inches at Kentucky's 11, the Hawkeyes were aggressive and wanted the touchdown ... but Petras and Tyler Linderbaum couldn't connect on the snap and Petras fell on the ball behind the line of scrimmage. Seven plays, 69 yards ... no points. This stat from Register columnist Chad Leistikow is damning. The Hawkeyes were able to gain a few chunks of yards, to get close enough for a last-second Hail Mary from Spencer Petras. It was intercepted. To halftime we go, and the Wildcats start the second half with the ball. Petras went 10-for-16 for 82 yards and two interceptions. Gavin Williams led the backfield with five carries for 25 yards. This half has been pretty much all Kentucky, with the Wildcats out-possessing Iowa 19:22 to 10:38. They're also 4-for-7 on third-down attempts, while Iowa is 0-for-4. Another save from the Hawkeye defense.",
          "A hard play-action on second down, then a little screen to Sam LaPorta running behind Mason Richman and Tyler Linderbaum as lead blockers. It worked to perfection for a 36-yard touchdown pass. What a drive\u00a0\u2014 nine plays, 92 yards, 3:15 of clock. Iowa has looked like an entirely different team in this second half. Big plays from Jack Campbell spearheaded Iowa's defensive effort to stall Kentucky near midfield, and now the Hawkeyes take over at their 8-yard line, down 13-10. And Gavin Williams starts the drive with a 19-yard run. Can you say momentum swing? We've got ourselves a game, folks. Good things usually happen when Arland Bruce IV, who was an All-Iowa Elite Team running back in his senior season at Ankeny, gets the ball in the backfield. The true freshman capped a six-play, 50-yard drive with a 20-yard rushing score on a jet sweep, a play that's traditionally been kind to the Hawkeyes. LeShon Williams also logged two carries for 20 yards on that drive. Iowa already has 119 total yards in the second half, which nearly matches their whole first-half total. Iowa's defense came out of the half well and forced a Kentucky punt.",

            "ORLANDO, Fla. - LSU football certainly woke up feeling the cheesiest on Monday. The No. 16 Tigers (10-4) dominated Purdue (8-6) in the Cheez-It Citrus Bowl at Camping World Stadium, 63-7. LSU punted on its first drive and then proceeded to score touchdowns on its next six drives, finishing off the game with a 99-yard interception and score from safety Quad Wilson. A win heavily favored the Tigers after Purdue coach Jeff Brohm had left the Boilermakers for Louisville, star quarterback Aidan O'Connell and wide receiver Charlie Jones opted out of the game to prepare for the 2023 NFL Draft. Regardless, LSU played a nearly flawless game. The Tigers didn't allow any points until the fourth quarter, and by that time they were already up 49-0. Jayden Daniels and Garrett Nussmeier split reps at quarterback for most of the game until freshman Walker Howard finished off the game in the fourth quarter. With a double-digit win total to finish off coach Brian Kelly's first season, the Tigers can head into the 2023 campaign on a positive note, especially with Daniels and the vast majority of the offense returning. After scoring its first touchdown of the game, LSU made a surprising change. Nussmeier, despite Daniels being healthy and playing well on the last drive, replaced LSU's starter at quarterback.",

The Tigers (9-4, 6-2 SEC West) will be out to snap a two-game losing streak after falling 50-30 to top-ranked Georgia in the SEC Championship Game on Dec. 3. The Boilermakers (8-5, 6-3 Big Ten West) had a three-game winning streak snapped in the Big Ten Conference Championship Game. In that matchup, No. 2 Michigan rolled to a 43-22 win. Both teams have been hit hard with departures via the transfer portal and NFL opt-outs. Most notably, Purdue will be without quarterback Aidan O'Connell, while LSU won't have\u00a0Jay Ward and edge rusher BJ Ojulari.\u00a0 Kickoff is set for 1 p.m. ET.

The 37-yard run by Daniels marked a season-long.\u00a0 Cain recorded his second rushing touchdown of the game with a 9-yard score, extending LSU\u2019s lead to 28-0 with 8:23 to play in the first half at Camping World Stadium. With Purdue driving inside the LSU 30, Burton\u2019s pass was interception by senior corner\u00a0Jarrick Bernard-Converse. On a trick play, Nabers found Kyren Lacy for a 45-yard completion to the Purdue 10. (The 45-yard completion from Nabers to Lacey was the longest by an LSU non-QB since WR Todd Kinchen threw a 51-yard TD pass to WR Tony Moss vs. Ohio on 9/30/1989.) Nussmeier, who was back under center, then found Brian Thomas Jr. for a 10-yard touchdown to make it 35-0. Taking a 35-0 lead into the break, LSU tied its school record for half-time margin in a bowl game (35). (LSU led Oklahoma in the CFP Semifinal (Peach Bowl), 49-14, on Dec. 28, 2019.",
            "Wide receivers Landon Ibieta and Evan Francioni were featured in spots with Kayshon Boutte entering the draft, Chris Hilton injured and Jack Bech transferring to TCU.

            "The drive culminated in a 1-yard scoring run from senior running back John Emery to give the Tigers a 7-0 lead with 7:01 remaining in the first quarter of action. After forcing Purdue to punt, the Tigers were awarded an extra 15 yards after a kick-catch interference penalty was enforced. Gregory Clayton fair caught the football at the LSU 18 and the penalty moved the ball to the 33. Nussmeier entered at quarterback on LSU\u2019s third offensive possession of the game. On 3rd-and-4, Nussmeier found Taylor for an 17-yard completion and first down to the Purdue 14. Noah Cain rushed up the middle for a 9-yard touchdown, extending the lead to 14-0 with 1:06 to play in the first quarter.\u00a0 It was a strong start for the LSU defense, holding Purdue to just four pass yards and 17 rush yards in the first quarter of play. Daniels returned at quarterback for the Tigers, finding Nabers for a 17-yard connection to the Purdue 46 and then finding Taylor for a 32-yard touchdown completion, creating some separation with an early 21-0 advantage with 13:03 to play in the second quarter.\u00a0 On their next offensive possession, Daniels went back to Taylor for a 15-yard completion over the middle of the field to the LSU 45.

            "Purdue odds from Caesars Sportsbook, while the over/under for total points scored is 56. Before making any Purdue vs. LSU picks, you need to see the college football predictions and betting advice from the SportsLine Projection Model. The model simulates every FBS college football game 10,000 times. Over the past six-plus years, the proprietary computer model has generated a stunning profit of almost $2,500 for $100 players on its top-rated college football picks against the spread. Anyone who has followed it has seen huge returns. Now, the model has set its sights on LSU vs. Purdue and just locked in its picks and Citrus Bowl 2023 predictions. You can visit SportsLine now to see the model's picks. Here are the college football odds and trends for Purdue vs. LSU:\u00a0 With receivers Kayshon Boutte (NFL opt-out), Jaray Jenkins (NFL opt-out) and Jack Bech (transfer portal) also out, the Tigers will likely want to lean on the run game to ease the burden on quarterback Jayden Daniels. Junior running back Josh Williams is one player the Tigers can turn to. He leads the team's running backs with 97 carries for 532 yards (5.5 average) and is third with six touchdowns. Williams also has 21 receptions for 132 yards (6.3 average). He has rushed for 100 or more yards in three of the 11 games he's played in.",
            "His best game was an 18-carry, 118-yard and one-touchdown performance in a 13-10 win at Arkansas on Nov. 12. In the SEC title game against Georgia, he carried six times for 55 yards (9.2 average), including a 47-yarder. He has been hampered with an ankle injury. Among those leading the defense is senior linebacker Micah Baskerville. He leads the team in tackles with 83, including 39 solo, with one sack for six yards. He also has six pass breakups and one interception he returned for 29 yards and a touchdown. Baskerville has registered nine tackles in each of the last two games, including six solo against Georgia on Dec. 3. He was named to the Butkus Award Watch List for the 2022 season, and was LSU's top returning tackler after finishing second on the team with 83 a year ago. With the Boilermakers' top two pass catchers -- wide receiver Charlie Jones and tight end Payne Durham\u00a0-- declaring for the NFL Draft, junior wide out TJ\u00a0Sheffield will look to take advantage of a bigger role on the offense. Sheffield had 39 receptions for 424 yards (10.9 average) and three touchdowns during the regular season. In the Big Ten title game against Michigan, he caught four passes for 54 yards (13.5 average).",
            "The Tigers forced a turnover on downs to open the second half as senior linebacker Micah Baskerville nearly intercepted Burton on 4th-and-4 from the Purdue 45. Nabers found Daniels for a 5-yard touchdown pass on a trick play. That marked Nabers\u2019 second passing completion of the game, giving him 50 yards through the air and a touchdown to extend the Tigers\u2019 lead to 42-0. With the receiving score, Daniels also became the only LSU quarterback with a passing and receiving touchdown in the same game since at least World War II. Brooks picked off Alaimo at the Purdue 27 with 9:17 remaining in the third quarter. Nabers added to an already impressive day by taking a jet sweep from Nussmeier 75 yards for a touchdown, extending the LSU lead to 49-0 with 3:15 left in the third quarter. On the second play from scrimmage in the fourth quarter, the Boilermakers got on the board as Alaimo found Sheffield for a 16-yard touchdown to make it 49-7 Tigers. True freshman Walker Howard entered at quarterback for LSU, leading the offense to a seven play scoring drive, culminating in a 12-yard touchdown rush up the middle by Derrick Davis Jr. to extend the lead to 56-7.",
            "He immediately started showcasing his arm talent, taking a shot deep to Malik Nabers on his first throw of the game. Like Daniels, he finished the drive with a touchdown. Nussmeier completed 4-of-6 passes on the drive for 39 yards, most notably finding Mason Taylor on third down for 17 yards to get LSU into the red zone. Nussmeier rotated out for Daniels on the next drive which also led to a touchdown. But that drive wasn't his last, as Nussmeier finished the game with 173 passing yards and two touchdowns. His only error came in the third quarter when he threw an interception in the end zone that snapped LSU's six-touchdown streak. But regardless of the result, Nussmeier's early insertion into the game poses an interesting wrinkle for LSU's quarterback's room heading into spring practices. Without three starters on the defensive line and with little to no depth at wide receiver and cornerback, LSU had to shake up its rotations with some new faces even before the game got out of hand in the fourth quarter. On the defensive line, edge rusher Zavier Carter was featured on a few passing downs in the first half while linebacker Mike Jones Jr., who has played limited snaps in the second half of the season, played more with BJ Ojulari opting out for the NFL Draft and Desmond Little in the transfer portal.",

          "In the win, Oregon State limited Florida to only 219 yards of offense. The only points UF managed to score came on a field goal with 37 seconds left in regulation. Before going 7-6 in 2021, Oregon State had seven consecutive losing seasons. Now the Beavers are 17-9 over the past two seasons. And with Clemson transfer quarterback DJ Uiagalelei joining the program next season, the Beavers could be a trendy preseason pick to contend for the Pac-12 title. Florida State: The Seminoles have 10 wins in a season for the first time since 2016 after a 35-32 win over Oklahoma in the Cheez-It Bowl. Jordan Travis threw for 418 yards on 38 attempts while Johnny Wilson had eight catches for 202 yards. The Seminoles had 587 yards on 72 plays and won the game despite going 0-of-3 on fourth down attempts. It\u2019s the first bowl win for Florida State since 2017 and a huge boost for a program that will enter 2023 as the top challenger to Clemson in the ACC. Pitt QB Nick Patti: Nick Patti has been a backup at Pitt for the past five seasons but got a chance to start in the Sun Bowl vs. UCLA. He made it count. In just his third career start, Patti led the Panthers to an epic comeback win.",

          "The 2022 Vrbo Citrus Bowl was a heck of a great game, with momentum swings and thrilling, crunch-time drives from either team.\u00a0 But that matters very little to the Hawkeyes and their fans, who will fly back to Iowa with a 20-17 loss to Mark Stoops and the SEC's Kentucky. The Hawkeyes had their destiny in their own hands, with the ball and a timeout, starting at their 25, down 20-17, with 1:48 left to win the game. And the drive started with promise. Iowa advanced to the Kentucky 40 with 48 seconds left. But then, Spencer Petras threw an errant pass into the diving arms of DeAndre Square at the Wildcats' 26. Game over. Here's how it happened. That was just a heck of a drive by Kentucky, highlighted by Wan'Dale Robinson's 52-yard catch-and-run to give him 17 catches for 170 yards so far today. Chris Rodriguez Jr. finished off the eight-play, 80-yard drive with a 6-yard rushing score. Now, can Iowa's much-maligned offense, which has performed considerably better in the second half than it did the first, win the game for this defense? Also: Tyler Linderbaum is back in the game. Iowa went three-and-out. It tried to draw Kentucky offside on a fourth-and-1 but it didn't work so Tory Taylor punted.",
          "The Aggies opened the season 1-5 before closing out the year by winning six of seven to finish 7-6. NMSU won a combined eight games in its previous four seasons, so Kill has executed an incredible turnaround in his first year on the job. Diego Pavia was the star of the bowl win. Pavia threw for 167 yards and two touchdowns and added 65 rushing yards in the win. He picked up several key third-down conversions with his legs in the second half to help his team secure the win. Southern Miss RB Frank Gore Jr.: Frank Gore Jr. ran wild in Southern Miss\u2019 win over Rice in the LendingTree Bowl. Gore set an all-time bowl record with 329 yards on just 21 carries in the 38-24 win. Gore rushed for two touchdowns and also had an 18-yard touchdown catch. The previous single-game bowl rushing record was 317 yards, but Gore surged past that with a 55-yard touchdown run in the final minutes. Southern Miss won a combined six games in 2020 and 2021, but the bowl win over Rice gave the Golden Eagles seven wins for the 2022 season. And with Gore and a significant chunk of this team\u2019s core expected to return, Southern Miss could be a team on the rise in the Sun Belt next season. Eastern Michigan: With a win over San Jose State in the Potato Bowl, EMU notched its first bowl victory since 1987.",
          "Western Kentucky: WKU may have had the most impressive performance of bowl season. The Hilltoppers trounced South Alabama 44-23 in the New Orleans Bowl in a game that was not as close as the final score may indicate. South Alabama was looking for its first-ever bowl win, but WKU jumped out to a 31-3 halftime lead and never looked back, putting up a total of 677 yards by the time the final seconds ticked off. Austin Reed threw for 497 yards and four touchdowns in the win. Air Force: Air Force looked right at home on an incredibly cold night in Fort Worth. The Falcons ran all over Baylor in a 30-15 victory in the Armed Forces Bowl. Air Force rushed for 276 yards and limited Baylor to just 42 rushing yards. With the win, Air Force got to double-digit victories for the third time in four seasons. AFA went 11-2 in 2019 and 10-3 in the past two seasons. In the shortened 2020 season, the Falcons finished 3-3. As a program, Air Force has won four consecutive bowl games. New Mexico State: Year 1 of the Jerry Kill era at New Mexico State ended with a bowl victory. NMSU knocked off Bowling Green 24-19 in the Quick Lane Bowl on Monday to capture the program\u2019s second bowl victory since 1960.",
          "The game was a punt hater\u2019s dream. And it was a nightmare for Ole Miss QB Jaxson Dart. He threw three interceptions and fumbled once. Texas Tech QB Tyler Shough rushed for two TDs and threw for another as the Red Raiders easily held on to a 19-point halftime lead throughout the second half. The loss also meant that Ole Miss ends the season at 8-5 after starting the season 7-0. Oklahoma: The Sooners entered the Cheez-It Bowl shorthanded and as significant underdogs to Florida State. Losing 35-32 was still a cover for Oklahoma. But the loss also means that Oklahoma finishes the season at 6-7. That\u2019s the first losing season for OU since 1998. The first year of the Brent Venables era was a bit rocky \u2014 especially when you consider the success that Caleb Williams and Lincoln Riley had at USC. But there\u2019s no reason to panic in Norman. Yet. SMU: The Mustangs entered the New Mexico Bowl as 4.5-point favorites over a BYU team that started freshman third-string QB Sol-Jay Maiava-Peters for the first time. Yet BYU did just enough on the ground to eke out a 24-23 win after stopping an SMU two-point conversion with eight seconds left.",
          "Head coach Kirk Ferentz has kept things close to the vest with his signal-callers, but it's looking like Petras, who started the season as the starter and ended the season as the starter, will get the nod. Star running back Tyler Goodson opted out of the Citrus Bowl for the Hawkeyes as he prepares for the NFL Draft. Freshman receiver Keagan Johnson has also been ruled out for the Citrus Bowl.",
          "Georgia Southern: The Camellia Bowl was a painful watch if you were an Eagles fan. Buffalo beat Georgia Southern 23-21 after going 12-of-19 on third down while averaging less than three yards a carry. In addition to being unable to consistently stop Buffalo on third down, Georgia Southern players dropped multiple catchable passes. Kyle Vantrease threw for 352 yards on 45 attempts and hit Joshua Thompson on a 79-yard TD. But Georgia Southern never got the ball back after pulling within two with 3:38 to go because of two crucial third down conversions by the Bulls to run out the clock. Oklahoma State: The Cowboys entered the Guaranteed Rate Bowl as underdogs to Wisconsin, so OSU\u2019s 24-17 loss to the Badgers wasn\u2019t terribly surprising. But it\u2019s still worth noting just how poorly OSU finished the season. The Cowboys started the season 6-1 and finished 7-6 after ending the season on a 1-5 run. Yeah, Oklahoma State played the final two games of the season without QB Spencer Sanders, but the biggest culprit for the collapse was the regression of the defense in 2022. A testy Mike Gundy didn\u2019t want to talk about any potential staff changes after the game and we\u2019re not going to be surprised if there are some staff announcements forthcoming from OSU in the near future.",
          "Iowa QBs combined to throw for seven TDs all season while the defense itself scored six touchdowns. UCLA: UCLA had a meltdown in the Sun Bowl, blowing a 14-point lead in a loss to Pitt. The Bruins led 28-14 midway through the third quarter but allowed Pitt to come back and win 37-35 with a field goal in the final seconds. In his final college game, Dorian Thompson-Robinson threw three costly interceptions. Two came deep in Pitt territory and the third came deep in his own territory, giving the Panthers a short field to tie the game at 28-28 early in the fourth. To make matters worse, UCLA fumbled the ensuing kickoff to allow Pitt to take the lead. Later in the fourth, UCLA scored with 34 seconds to go to take a 35-34 lead. It looked like it would be the game-winner, but the defense allowed Pitt to go 46 yards in 30 seconds and kick the game-winning field goal. Brutal. UCLA has not won a bowl game since the 2014 season. Ole Miss: The Rebels had 11 drives that didn\u2019t end in points in a 42-25 loss to Texas Tech in the Texas Bowl. Ole Miss turned the ball over five times, gave up the ball five times on downs and punted once. While the Rebels were just 2-of-7 on fourth downs, Texas Tech was 5-of-6.",
          "Gavin Williams,\u00a0LeShon Williams and Arland Bruce IV\u00a0have taken the five total rushes and Spencer Petras is 3-for-5 for 18 yards so far. Nothing hideous. But nothing effective, either. Well, that was not very difficult. After Iowa's empty possession to start the day, Kentucky responded with a methodical 13-play, 80-yard scoring drive that ate up 7:28 of clock. Quarterback Will Levis capped it with a 5-yard touchdown pass to running back Chris Rodriguez Jr. The Wildcats converted on two third downs\u00a0\u2014 a third-and-3 at their 42 (they got a 5-yard run) and a third-and-4 at Iowa's 29 (they got a 14-yard completion). Nothing doing on the Hawkeyes' first possession. Spencer Petras started with a 12-yard completion to Sam LaPorta on the game's first play, but Iowa went three-and-out from there. Kentucky will take over at its 20 after Tory Taylor's punt went into the end zone. Spencer Petras was on the field for the first snap. Start question, answered. Looking for some pregame reading? Here's Register columnist Chad Leistikow with his prediction for the Citrus Bowl. There was a lot of talk about whether it'd\u00a0be Spencer Petras or Alex Padilla behind center for the Hawkeyes today.",
          "The freshman Maiava-Peters threw for just 47 yards and an interception but rushed 14 times for 96 yards while Christopher Brooks rushed 19 times for 88 yards. SMU didn\u2019t have receiver Rashee Rice but still had just 218 yards passing on 37 pass attempts. UTSA: The Roadrunners are still searching for their first bowl win after losing 18-12 to Troy in the Cure Bowl. It was an absolutely ugly performance from UTSA too. Without offensive coordinator Will Stein (now the OC at Oregon), the proficient UTSA offense committed five turnovers. The Roadrunners also had nine penalties for 104 yards and many of those penalties came at critical times. A win over the Trojans would have been a big boost to a UTSA team making a step up to the AAC in 2023. NC State: Dave Doeren's risk-averse decision-making may have cost his team a bowl win. NC State lost the Duke's Mayo Bowl 16-12. In the loss, Doeren decided to kick field goals twice inside the Maryland 10-yard line. In the first half, Doeren kicked on fourth-and-goal from the 2. And when his team trailed 13-9 midway through the fourth, Doeren sent his kicker out instead of going for it on fourth-and-3 from the 9.",
          "It\u2019s been a long time coming. Before Chris Creighton arrived as head coach in 2014, the 1987 California Bowl was the program\u2019s last bowl trip. Since then, Creighton brought the Eagles to five bowl games, but this year was the first time EMU pulled out the victory. With the win, EMU finished 9-4 for the season. That\u2019s the second-most wins in a season in program history. Kentucky: The Wildcats made sure that the Music City Bowl was going to hit the under in a 21-0 loss to Iowa. The total for the game was 31 and the lowest total for a bowl game in decades. It was also the lowest total of any game this season after Iowa and Minnesota had a pregame total of 31.5 in what turned out to be a 13-10 game. And just like that Iowa win, this game went under too. The two teams combined for fewer than 400 total yards and punted the ball 18 times with just 21 first downs between them. It was as ugly as an offensive performance as we all expected, especially from Kentucky. Freshman QB Destin Wade started in place of Will Levis and threw two pick sixes in the second quarter. The loss drops the Wildcats to 7-6 in what ultimately is a disappointing season while Iowa finishes at 8-5 despite its remarkable offensive futility throughout the season.",
          "The NC State offense struggled mightily all day, and that ended up being the final scoring opportunity of the game for NC State. San Diego State: The Aztecs turned the ball over five times in a 25-23 loss to Middle Tennessee in the Hawaii Bowl. The Blue Raiders had just 170 yards in the win and threw for 236 yards. Yes, you read that correctly. Thanks to sacks, MTSU had a remarkable -66 rushing yards on 30 attempts. And still won the game. SDSU QB Jalen Mayden threw three interceptions and also had a fumble. The Aztecs\u2019 final turnover came with 55 seconds to go on a 4th and 24 when Tyrell Shavers fumbled the ball after a 12-yard gain. Cincinnati: It was a listless performance for the Bearcats in a 24-7 loss to Louisville in the Fenway Bowl. Cincinnati had just 127 yards of total offense and allowed 419 yards to the Cardinals. Cincy got just 10 first downs and rushed for 44 yards on 38 attempts after sacks were factored in. Louisville even turned the ball over four times to Cincinnati\u2019s two and the game still wasn\u2019t close. If you didn\u2019t know any better, you would have assumed that Scott Satterfield had gone to a far worse team when he left Louisville for Cincy before the bowl game.",
          "He threw for 224 yards and ran for 73 more, including a gutsy 11-yard scramble that set up the game-winning field goal. UCLA took a 35-34 lead with 34 seconds remaining, but Patti quickly led the Panthers into field goal range, allowing Ben Sauls to boot his fourth field goal of the game. This one, a 47-yarder, was the game-winner. Pitt coach Pat Narduzzi has already indicated that Patti won't be back next season. So if that was Patti's final college game, he went out with a bang. Fresno State: After a 1-4 start, Fresno State closed out the season with nine consecutive wins. After beating Boise State in the Mountain West title game, the Bulldogs cruised past Washington State 29-6 in the LA Bowl to get to 10 wins for the fourth time in the last six seasons. In the process, Fresno State became the first team in FBS history to get to 10 wins after losing four of five to start the season. The LA Bowl was the final college game for Jake Haener and he went out in style. Haener threw for 280 yards and two touchdowns while Jordan Mims rushed out for 209 yards and had two scores of his own. Duke: Duke went from winless in ACC play in 2021 to nine wins in 2022.",
          "Duke capped off a remarkable season by beating UCF 30-13 on Wednesday in the Military Bowl \u2014 the program\u2019s first bowl win since 2018. With the win, Duke got to nine wins for the first time since 2014. Mike Elko has done one of the best coaching jobs in the country in his first season with the Blue Devils. The program was barely competitive in David Cutcliffe\u2019s final seasons on the job, going a combined 5-18 (1-17 ACC) in his final two years. With Wednesday\u2019s win, Duke finished the season 9-4 overall with a 5-3 mark in ACC play. It was just the third season in school history that the Blue Devils had finished with a winning conference record and won a bowl game. Washington: After going 4-8 in 2021, Washington capped off a tremendous turnaround by beating Texas 27-20 in the Alamo Bowl. With the win, Washington finished the season with 11 wins \u2014 the most it has had in a season since 2016. That's the year the Huskies reached the College Football Playoff. After coming over from Fresno State, head coach Kalen DeBoer was able to revitalize the program in just one season. The addition of quarterback Michael Penix Jr. played a big role. Penix, who will return next season, threw for 287 yards and two touchdowns in the bowl win.",

          "After a disastrous first play that saw Kentucky log a 10-yard run and get an extra 10 yards to Iowa's 11, the Hawkeye defense shored up and forced the Wildcats to settle for another field goal after they intercepted Patras at the 31. Spencer Petras' second-and-11 pass was tipped at the line of scrimmage and intercepted, and Kentucky will take over at Iowa's\u00a031-yard line. Oh dear ... that was painful for Hawkeye fans. Zach VanValkenburg and Joe Evans secured back-to-back sacks to force Kentucky into a third-and-26 from its 46-yard line. Then ... Will Levis connected with Wan'Dale Robinson for a 34-yard completion down the middle, right in the hole of Iowa's defense. The Hawkeyes were able to force the Wildcats into a 21-yard field goal, so that was a win. But still, not getting off the field on a third-and-24 is rough. It was another long, methodical drive\u00a0\u2014 14 plays, 72 yards, 8:15 of time. My goodness, it's hot down there. On-field temperatures are well above 100 degrees in Orlando, Florida, at Camping World Stadium for the Citrus Bowl. Not quite the 10-degree winter weather we're getting here in Iowa, eh? Iowa's offense showed some good things on a scoring drive that led to a 28-yard field goal from Caleb Shudak.",
          "The the offense responded with its best drive of the day, featuring a gorgeous 34-yard completion from Spencer Petras to Sam LaPorta and 27 hard-earned yards from Gavin Williams on three carries. But on a fourth-and-inches at Kentucky's 11, the Hawkeyes were aggressive and wanted the touchdown ... but Petras and Tyler Linderbaum couldn't connect on the snap and Petras fell on the ball behind the line of scrimmage. Seven plays, 69 yards ... no points. This stat from Register columnist Chad Leistikow is damning. The Hawkeyes were able to gain a few chunks of yards, to get close enough for a last-second Hail Mary from Spencer Petras. It was intercepted. To halftime we go, and the Wildcats start the second half with the ball. Petras went 10-for-16 for 82 yards and two interceptions. Gavin Williams led the backfield with five carries for 25 yards. This half has been pretty much all Kentucky, with the Wildcats out-possessing Iowa 19:22 to 10:38. They're also 4-for-7 on third-down attempts, while Iowa is 0-for-4. Another save from the Hawkeye defense.",
          "A hard play-action on second down, then a little screen to Sam LaPorta running behind Mason Richman and Tyler Linderbaum as lead blockers. It worked to perfection for a 36-yard touchdown pass. What a drive\u00a0\u2014 nine plays, 92 yards, 3:15 of clock. Iowa has looked like an entirely different team in this second half. Big plays from Jack Campbell spearheaded Iowa's defensive effort to stall Kentucky near midfield, and now the Hawkeyes take over at their 8-yard line, down 13-10. And Gavin Williams starts the drive with a 19-yard run. Can you say momentum swing? We've got ourselves a game, folks. Good things usually happen when Arland Bruce IV, who was an All-Iowa Elite Team running back in his senior season at Ankeny, gets the ball in the backfield. The true freshman capped a six-play, 50-yard drive with a 20-yard rushing score on a jet sweep, a play that's traditionally been kind to the Hawkeyes. LeShon Williams also logged two carries for 20 yards on that drive. Iowa already has 119 total yards in the second half, which nearly matches their whole first-half total. Iowa's defense came out of the half well and forced a Kentucky punt.",

Sophia Bush is back on TV for Good Sam, and here's how the CBS drama compares to other current medical shows. Spoilers ahead for the series premiere of Good Sam on CBS. CBS has officially gotten into the medical drama game with the debut of Good Sam, starring Sophia Bush in her big series regular return to network television after her exit from Chicago P.D. in 2017. As Dr. Sam Griffith, Bush \u2013\u00a0in her first turn playing a doctor on TV \u2013\u00a0takes on a leadership role at her hospital by becoming chief of surgery\u2026 with the complication that her father (played by Jason Isaacs) formerly held that position before ending up in a coma after being shot. When he awakes and must work under his daughter, there are more problems than just medical mysteries for Sam to deal with.\u00a0 The show packed a lot into the pilot episode to establish not only Sam and dad Rob \u201cGriff\u201d Griffith, but also her mom and her team of doctors who are used to following Griff\u2019s lead rather than Sam\u2019s. CBS was the only broadcast network without a medical drama prior to Good Sam, and recruiting a TV veteran like Sophia Bush and a big name like Jason Isaacs was a strong way to start. So, how does it compare to the other, long-running medical dramas on TV?",
          "The only way to resume his job is as her subordinate, an arrangement which, for him, is untenable. Their interactions work, and Sophia Bush and Jason Isaacs seem like they could be a great pairing. The other characters around them fail to make much of an impression, except for Sam's mother and Griff's ex-wife, Vivian, who's an administrator at the hospital. Oh, and her new husband is also a doctor there. Adding to the intrigue, Sam's best friend Pippa sleeps with Griff! So, yes, there are some seriously intermingled lives at this hospital, and a fair number of twists in the pilot, but it's not clear where the show\u00a0goes from here, and/or whether CBS viewers will be invested enough in its characters to care. FINAL RECOMMENDATION: Good Sam is a solid pilot script with a fair number of twists. The father-daughter relationship at its heart is compelling, and Sophia Bush and Jason Isaacs seem well cast. That said, it doesn't feel like it brings much new to the medical show genre overall, and feels far more soapy than we've come to expect from CBS. It's not clear to me where it could fit in their schedule.

The Gist: In 1970, Taylor and King performed their first concert together at the famed Troubadour club in Hollywood. It was the beginning of a beautiful \u2013 100 percent platonic! \u2013 friendship in which they made beautiful music together, and I\u2019m sorry for the cliches, but in this case, they\u2019re true. They sang each other\u2019s songs, encouraged and complemented each other, and harmonized like tea and honey. Forty years later, they decided to celebrate their convergence with a 50-plus-date tour, and now, 12 years after that, we get a celebration of the celebration, a remembrance of a remembrance that brought so much joy to so many people 52 years ago and then again 12 years ago, and now again a third time officially, with this movie. Just Call Out My Name opens with clips of late-night talk show hosts (Leno, Carson, Letterman) introducing Taylor or King or both, then a blip of Oprah praising Taylor, but what she thinks of King, NOBODY KNOWS.",

The Gist: In 1970, Taylor and King performed their first concert together at the famed Troubadour club in Hollywood. It was the beginning of a beautiful \u2013 100 percent platonic! \u2013 friendship in which they made beautiful music together, and I\u2019m sorry for the cliches, but in this case, they\u2019re true. They sang each other\u2019s songs, encouraged and complemented each other, and harmonized like tea and honey. Forty years later, they decided to celebrate their convergence with a 50-plus-date tour, and now, 12 years after that, we get a celebration of the celebration, a remembrance of a remembrance that brought so much joy to so many people 52 years ago and then again 12 years ago, and now again a third time officially, with this movie. Just Call Out My Name opens with clips of late-night talk show hosts (Leno, Carson, Letterman) introducing Taylor or King or both, then a blip of Oprah praising Taylor, but what she thinks of King, NOBODY KNOWS."

Good Sam and Smallwood are expected to be for fall, as per traditional CBS practice, but that has yet to be confirmed. However, they won\u2019t be joined on the schedule by CBS\u2019 other three pilots; political drama Ways & Means, starring Patrick Dempsey, the Sarah Cooper/ Cindy Chupack single-camera comedy and Welcome To Georgia, starring Hannah Simone and Elizabeth Hurley, have all been passed on. Both Good Sam and Smallwood were seen as frontrunners in their genre with Good Sam considered a solid medical drama for the network that has been looking for a curative franchise, and pro bowling comedy Smallwood was getting early buzz as an easy fit into the traditional CBS\u2019 comedy brand. Good Sam stars One Tree Hill and Chicago P.D. star Bush as a talented yet stifled surgeon, who embraces her leadership role after her renowned and pompous boss falls into a coma.",
          "Based on       1 parent review     GOOD SAM plays in the standard medical procedural sandbox, but there is a family drama twist. Samantha Griffith (Sophia Bush) is a competent heart surgeon who became the head of the department after her hard-to-please father, Dr. Rob Griffith (Jason Isaacs), suffered an accident, thereby losing his title as department head. The switch-up leads Sam and her father to try to reconcile their relationship as Sam finds her way as a leader. This show seems to suggest CBS is keeping to its mission to steadily showcase more diverse, complicated storylines. While Good Sam could have easily been just a run-of-the-mill medical show about a problem of the week, the series also entangles its characters in some thorny familial drama. This adds a new layer to what fans of this type of genre might be used to, and thankfully so. Bush, who once headlined another procedural, Chicago P.D., is great at playing a woman who has grown tired of trying to please her father and wants to show her worth as a doctor on her own terms. English actor Isaacs' American accent falters at the beginning of the first episode, but by the time it's ended, you believe he's a difficult man who might have a good heart, but is buried underneath guilt and unresolved trauma.",

CBS has officially gotten into the medical drama game with the debut of Good Sam, starring Sophia Bush in her big series regular return to network television after her exit from Chicago P.D. in 2017. As Dr. Sam Griffith, Bush \u2013\u00a0in her first turn playing a doctor on TV \u2013\u00a0takes on a leadership role at her hospital by becoming chief of surgery\u2026 with the complication that her father (played by Jason Isaacs) formerly held that position before ending up in a coma after being shot. When he awakes and must work under his daughter, there are more problems than just medical mysteries for Sam to deal with.\u00a0 The show packed a lot into the pilot episode to establish not only Sam and dad Rob \u201cGriff\u201d Griffith, but also her mom and her team of doctors who are used to following Griff\u2019s lead rather than Sam\u2019s. CBS was the only broadcast network without a medical drama prior to Good Sam, and recruiting a TV veteran like Sophia Bush and a big name like Jason Isaacs was a strong way to start. So, how does it compare to the other, long-running medical dramas on TV?",

Oh, and her new husband is also a doctor there. Adding to the intrigue, Sam's best friend Pippa sleeps with Griff! So, yes, there are some seriously intermingled lives at this hospital, and a fair number of twists in the pilot, but it's not clear where the show\u00a0goes from here, and/or whether CBS viewers will be invested enough in its characters to care. FINAL RECOMMENDATION: Good Sam is a solid pilot script with a fair number of twists. The father-daughter relationship at its heart is compelling, and Sophia Bush and Jason Isaacs seem well cast. That said, it doesn't feel like it brings much new to the medical show genre overall, and feels far more soapy than we've come to expect from CBS.

At the genesis of their now 50 years of friendship and collaboration, six-time Grammy\u00ae Award-winner James Taylor and four-time Grammy\u00ae Award-winner Carole King, famously performed together in 1970 at The Troubadour, the storied Los Angeles club. The pair came together to reprise that concert for The Troubadour's own 50th anniversary in 2007.  As Taylor recalls in the film, those 2007 performances including \"So Far Away,\" \"I Feel the Earth Move,\" and \"You've Got a Friend,\" during six sold out concerts, were so much fun, that he and King hatched plans for a 2010 world tour.

So that's a hint that \"Good Sam\" might be a medical drama.\n\nDocument 4 says that \"Good Sam\" is a medical procedural with a family drama twist. It specifically states that Samantha Griffith is a heart surgeon and there's a family dynamic with her father. This confirms that the primary genre is medical procedural, with added family drama elements.\n\nDocument 2 talks about the show being on CBS on Wednesdays, which is a time slot for TV dramas, but doesn't specify the genre beyond mentioning it's a show with new episodes. Not helpful for genre here.\n\nDocument 3 mentions \"Good Sam Roadside Assistance,\" but that's a different context\u2014probably an ad or unrelated service. Doesn't relate to the TV show's genre.\n\nDocument 5 again refers to \"Good Sam Roadside Assistance,\" so same as Document 3. Not relevant here.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the main genre is medical procedural, with family drama elements. The answer should combine these. The user might be looking for the primary genre, which is medical procedural. The documents don't mention any inconsistencies here, so no need to flag factual errors.\n</think>\n\nThe genre of the drama \"Good Sam\" is a **medical procedural with a family drama twist**.

          "Based on       1 parent review     GOOD SAM plays in the standard medical procedural sandbox, but there is a family drama twist. Samantha Griffith (Sophia Bush) is a competent heart surgeon who became the head of the department after her hard-to-please father, Dr. Rob Griffith (Jason Isaacs), suffered an accident, thereby losing his title as department head. The switch-up leads Sam and her father to try to reconcile their relationship as Sam finds her way as a leader. This show seems to suggest CBS is keeping to its mission to steadily showcase more diverse, complicated storylines. While Good Sam could have easily been just a run-of-the-mill medical show about a problem of the week, the series also entangles its characters in some thorny familial drama. This adds a new layer to what fans of this type of genre might be used to, and thankfully so. Bush, who once headlined another procedural, Chicago P.D., is great at playing a woman who has grown tired of trying to please her father and wants to show her worth as a doctor on her own terms. English actor Isaacs' American accent falters at the beginning of the first episode, but by the time it's ended, you believe he's a difficult man who might have a good heart, but is buried underneath guilt and unresolved trauma.",

        "correct": true,
        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking about the genre of the drama \"Good Sam.\" I need to check the provided documents to find the answer.\n\nLooking at Document 2 first, it mentions \"Good Sam\" as a new CBS drama. It says it's likely to draw viewers towards more shows that revolve around medical drama and family issues. The document also refers to it as a \"medical drama\" and talks about the father-daughter relationship between the characters, which adds a family dynamics aspect. They compare it to other medical dramas like Grey's Anatomy and The Good Doctor. Additionally, they mention that the show has \"complex family dynamics,\" suggesting that it's a medical drama with elements of family issues.\n\nDocument 4 also talks about \"Good Sam,\" describing it as a drama where a surgeon takes on a leadership role when her boss (and father) falls into a coma. This again points to medical themes and family relationships. The other documents don't mention \"Good Sam\" so I'll focus on 2 and 4.\n\nSo combining the info, the genre is medical drama with family issues. The answer should reflect both aspects. The documents don't mention any conflicting information, so I can confidently state that.\n</think>\n\nThe genre of the drama \"Good Sam\" is a **medical drama** that also explores **family issues**. As stated in Document 2, it revolves around medical themes and the complex father-daughter relationship between the characters, alongside workplace tensions in a hospital setting. Document 4 further supports this by highlighting the protagonist's role as a surgeon navigating both professional and familial challenges.",

          "May 29, 2023 Few things feel like summer, quite like taking a vacation or going to the movies. There\u2019s something about the open road that just feels healing, and there\u2019s something about a silver screen and popcorn that just feels right.\u00a0 Now, every so often, something magical happens, and we\u2019re treated to a perfect combination of summer pastimes, culminating in a genre that stands alone: road-trip films.\u00a0 Stories about cooped-up families, reluctant companions, or cavalcades of muppets seem to resonate with all of us, validating the joys and stresses of our own cross-country adventures \u2013 almost as if we\u2019re watching a movie about ourselves. So, to celebrate the start of the summer season and to help spark some inspiration of what to do (or not do) on your next trip, we\u2019ve put together our list of the all-time best road-trip movies.\u00a0  Alright, so technically, this isn\u2019t a summer road-trip movie, considering it\u2019s one of the few films set during Thanksgiving, but it\u2019s still the all-time best buddy adventure film. Steve Martin and John Candy were a match made in Heaven, and the jokes still land over 30 years later. \u00a0 Little Miss Sunshine is a heartwarming indie comedy about a quirky family of misfits trying to get their daughter to a beauty pageant. It has an incredible soundtrack featuring Sufjan Stevens and stellar performances, including a burgeoning Steve Carell.",
          "The new CBS drama Good Sam is likely to draw viewers towards more shows that revolve around medical drama and family issues.  Starring Jason Isaacs and Sophia Bush, Good Sam delves into the strenuous father-daughter relationship between Dr. Sam Griffith and Dr. Rob Griffith. Tensions increase as the duo also happen to work in the same hospital.\u00a0 RELATED:\u00a010 Medical Dramas That Are Better Than Grey's Anatomy Good Sam serves as an interesting watch for medical drama fans. So, it is natural for audiences to also check out other genre classics like Grey\u2019s Anatomy and contemporary shows like The Good Doctor. At the same time, Good Sam\u2019s complex family dynamics imply that viewers can also binge their way through some acclaimed \u201cdysfunctional family dramas\u201d.  ABC's\u00a0The Good Doctor's main character Shaun Murphy is a\u00a0brilliant surgeon who relocates to a prestigious California hospital. Along with saving patient lives, he struggles to get over his troubled past and to counter his social insecurities. The show benefits greatly from Freddie Highmore\u2019s committed performance\u00a0as he emulates the optimistic nature of the lead character.\u00a0 Fans of Good Sam must check out The Good Doctor for it shows how a doctor\u2019s psyche can influence the operation. Even though Sam is still in her good-natured self, Rob is shown as a talented yet hot-headed surgeon.",
          "If Kermit the Frog making his way to Hollywood by way of a swamp in Florida, meeting Fozzie, Gonzo, and Miss Piggy along the way, and featuring cameos by Steve Martin, Richard Pryor, and Mel Brooks doesn\u2019t do anything for you, then I just don\u2019t know what will. \u00a0 The Coen Brothers have had a number of hits, but this 1930s reimagining of The Odyssey is one of the most clever and original adventure comedies of all time. The cast is stacked, the cinematography is well-crafted, and the soundtrack will get stuck in your head all day. \u00a0 This one\u2019s basically just a modern update to Planes, Trains, and Automobiles, but Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifianakis still bring a lot of humor and even a little bit of heart. Plus, it was directed by Todd Philips, who made Joker, which is a very different and much darker film, making Due Date all the more interesting. \u00a0 Okay, yes, this one feels a little unorthodox; but when you think about it, \u2018The Wizard of Oz\u2019 is kind of the first cross-country adventure film ever made (not to mention the first one made in color). It might be required viewing if you plan on passing through Kansas. \u00a0 If you like 90s comedies, it doesn\u2019t get any better than\u00a0Dumb and Dumber.",

Plus, it was directed by Todd Philips, who made Joker, which is a very different and much darker film, making Due Date all the more interesting. \u00a0 Okay, yes, this one feels a little unorthodox; but when you think about it, \u2018The Wizard of Oz\u2019 is kind of the first cross-country adventure film ever made (not to mention the first one made in color). It might be required viewing if you plan on passing through Kansas. \u00a0 If you like 90s comedies, it doesn\u2019t get any better than\u00a0Dumb and Dumber.",
          "May 29, 2023 Few things feel like summer, quite like taking a vacation or going to the movies. There\u2019s something about the open road that just feels healing, and there\u2019s something about a silver screen and popcorn that just feels right.\u00a0 Now, every so often, something magical happens, and we\u2019re treated to a perfect combination of summer pastimes, culminating in a genre that stands alone: road-trip films.\u00a0 Stories about cooped-up families, reluctant companions, or cavalcades of muppets seem to resonate with all of us, validating the joys and stresses of our own cross-country adventures \u2013 almost as if we\u2019re watching a movie about ourselves. So, to celebrate the start of the summer season and to help spark some inspiration of what to do (or not do) on your next trip, we\u2019ve put together our list of the all-time best road-trip movies.\u00a0  Alright, so technically, this isn\u2019t a summer road-trip movie, considering it\u2019s one of the few films set during Thanksgiving, but it\u2019s still the all-time best buddy adventure film. Steve Martin and John Candy were a match made in Heaven, and the jokes still land over 30 years later. \u00a0 Little Miss Sunshine is a heartwarming indie comedy about a quirky family of misfits trying to get their daughter to a beauty pageant. It has an incredible soundtrack featuring Sufjan Stevens and stellar performances, including a burgeoning Steve Carell.",

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking about the premiere date of the documentary \"Carole King & James Taylor: Just Call Out My Name.\" I need to check the provided documents to find any mention of when it was released.\n\nLooking at Document 1, the first paragraph mentions that HBO Max \"just debuted\" the documentary. The phrase \"just debuted\" suggests it was recently released, but the document doesn't specify an exact date. However, since Document 1 was written in 2023 (as per the date in the user's message), and the event is described as recent, it's possible the premiere was in 2023. \n\nDocument 3 and 4 also discuss the documentary but don't mention a specific premiere date. Document 4 refers to the 2010 Troubadour reunion tour, but that's the event the documentary is about, not the premiere date of the film itself. \n\nDocument 5 talks about The Immediate Family's tour in November, but again, no premiere date for the documentary. \n\nSince none of the documents provide an exact date beyond \"just debuted\" in Document 1, and considering the context, the answer would be that the premiere was in 2023, but without a specific month or day. However, the user might need more precise info. Wait, maybe the user's own message includes a date? The user's question is from a current interaction, but the documents don't have specific dates except for Document 1's mention of \"just debuted.\" Since the documents don't have exact dates, the answer should be that the information isn't provided. Wait, but Document 1 says \"HBO Max just debuted Carole King and James Taylor: Just Call Out My Name, a documentary/concert film...\" So the premiere was when HBO Max released it. But when? The documents don't specify the exact date. Therefore, the correct answer is that the documents don't have sufficient info. Wait, but maybe the user's own question includes the date? No, the user is asking based on the documents. Since none of the documents state the exact premiere date beyond \"just debuted,\" which is relative, the answer should be that the information isn't sufficient.\n</think>\n\nI can not answer the question because of the insufficient information in documents.",

At the genesis of their now 50 years of friendship and collaboration, six-time Grammy\u00ae Award-winner James Taylor and four-time Grammy\u00ae Award-winner Carole King, famously performed together in 1970 at The Troubadour, the storied Los Angeles club. The pair came together to reprise that concert for The Troubadour's own 50th anniversary in 2007.  As Taylor recalls in the film, those 2007 performances including \"So Far Away,\" \"I Feel the Earth Move,\" and \"You've Got a Friend,\" during six sold out concerts, were so much fun, that he and King hatched plans for a 2010 world tour.

          "I have no answer as to why the film wasn\u2019t released in 2011, but an appreciation of a musical collaboration that Rolling Stone magazine (and only Rolling Stone magazine) probably ranks really really high on some list of the greatest whatevers ever arrives better late than never.  The Gist: In 1970, Taylor and King performed their first concert together at the famed Troubadour club in Hollywood. It was the beginning of a beautiful \u2013 100 percent platonic! \u2013 friendship in which they made beautiful music together, and I\u2019m sorry for the cliches, but in this case, they\u2019re true. They sang each other\u2019s songs, encouraged and complemented each other, and harmonized like tea and honey. Forty years later, they decided to celebrate their convergence with a 50-plus-date tour, and now, 12 years after that, we get a celebration of the celebration, a remembrance of a remembrance that brought so much joy to so many people 52 years ago and then again 12 years ago, and now again a third time officially, with this movie. Just Call Out My Name opens with clips of late-night talk show hosts (Leno, Carson, Letterman) introducing Taylor or King or both, then a blip of Oprah praising Taylor, but what she thinks of King, NOBODY KNOWS.",

Also interviewed in the film are sidemen Danny Kortchmar, Russ Kunkel, and Lee Sklar, who accompanied the duo on all their shows together from 1970 through 2010.\u00a0 King is about to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland on Oct. 30, where Taylor Swift and Jennifer Hudson will act as presenters and perform her songs.

And not a moment too soon! The events of the film occurred long enough ago that it\u2019s essentially nostalgic about nostalgia about ubiquitous songs from the early 1970s.",
          "From here on out, there will be no point of view presented outside the King-Taylor circle, so the hell with context, let\u2019s get to the music, which comprises the bulk of the film. Cue a clip of King singing \u201cSo Far Away\u201d in the early 1970s, then seamlessly segueing to a 2010 performance of the same song, illustrating how her voice has aged from lovely to lovelier \u2013 but don\u2019t expect any more such thoughtful comparison or savvy editing, because from here on out, director Frank Marshall sticks with modern performances and brief snippets of backstage footage and interviews. So brace yourselves for the easy listening songs you may not be a fan of, but probably know well anyway: \u201cIt\u2019s Too Late,\u201d \u201cSweet Baby James,\u201d \u201cFire and Rain,\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve Got a Friend\u201d and many others. Behind the scenes, King and Taylor work out the set list, and share frustratingly brief anecdotes, e.g., the inspiration behind certain songs, or how King spent a decade of her career writing songs for others before Taylor recruited her to play piano for his band, and all but pushed her on stage to sing her own material. We meet their band for the Troubadour tour, the core members the very same musicians who backed them in 1970; they have tons of loving praise for King and Taylor, and offer a little insight into their dynamic.",
          "Kootch, Sklar, and Kunkel have been session musicians for a number of major musicians over the years and have been a part of their own band, The Section. The rest is history. Taylor and King discuss the challenges that come with performing an intimate show in an era. They decide to perform in a round and play towards everyone in the audience as the night goes on. If not for Taylor providing the inspiration, King might not have started writing songs for herself. Taylor first played the Troubadour in 1969. The historic Los Angeles music venue played home to so many famous bands over the years. I love the humor as the duo segues between songs. Hey, if you can\u2019t find the original set list, there are so many hits to choose from!\u201cShe wrote too many good songs,\u201d Taylor says about having a problem with their show. To which King quickly responds, \u201cAs did he.\u201dWhen it came to writing \u201cYou\u2019ve Got a Friend,\u201d Carole King didn\u2019t have any person in mind but it just came out of her on the piano. Both James Taylor and Peter Asher were in the balcony as she was performing it during a run-through at the Troubadour. Taylor instantly knew it was a hit and asked if he could make his own version.When you have musical superstars of their stature, too many songs is not a bad thing. It just means that there\u2019s no shortage of hits to play during concert.",
          "The documentary\u2019s new interview with King and Taylor, coupled with their performances, highlight the camaraderie and chemistry radiating from their enduring music and lifelong friendship. They reflect on their collaborative relationship and share several stories about their songs, including \u201cYou\u2019ve Got a Friend.\u201d In the film, King explains the song \u201cpurely came through me.\u201d Taylor first heard King play the then new song at soundcheck before their debut Troubadour show together, and they share how he came to cover it. Band members of the Section \u2014 Danny Kortchmar, Russ Kunkel, and Lee Sklar \u2014 who backed the duo through all three concert eras are also interviewed, along with insight from musician/producer Peter Asher.

          "Prior to forming The Immediate Family, Kortchmar, Kunkel and Sklar have worked together since the early 70's as the legendary ensemble \"The Section\" backing up James Taylor and Carole King on The Troubadour Reunion Tour as well as appearing on Taylor and King's various albums.

          "Towards the end, we get current-day interviews with Taylor and King, who look back lovingly on the time they looked back lovingly to the time when they were doing the same thing, except they were younger. What Movies Will It Remind You Of?: Marshall also directed The Bee Gees: How Can You Mend a Broken Heart, so add in that doc about the Eagles (History of the Eagles) and the one about The Band (Once Were Brothers: Robbie Robertson and the Band) and make a day of it \u2013 but only if you\u2019re, like, 68. Performance Worth Watching: King still lends palpable passion to \u201cIt\u2019s Too Late,\u201d and Taylor, during a terrific performance of \u201cCountry Road,\u201d convincingly, amusingly and with great fury stretches the word \u201ccountry\u201d to 3.5, maybe even four, syllables. Memorable Dialogue: Taylor on-the-noses it during the tour\u2019s opening number: \u201cShe\u2019s been with me now a long, long time, and I feel fine,\u201d he sings. Sex and Skin: I said it was 100 percent platonic, and it stayed that way! Our Take: It\u2019s easy to be a little cynical about the feelgood sounds of 1972, with its plaintive and sincere lyrics, gently fingerpicked guitars and tender piano \u2013 it\u2019s the soundtrack to a stack of flowery, earnest greeting cards.",

        "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out the genre of the drama \"Good Sam\" based on the provided documents. \n\nFirst, I'll look through each document to see if there's any mention of the genre.\n\nStarting with Document 1: It talks about Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels in a movie, mentions \"Christmas Vacation\" as a road-trip classic. But this seems to be about a movie, not the TV show \"Good Sam.\" There's also an ad for Good Sam Roadside Assistance, which is unrelated. So probably not helpful here.\n\nDocument 2: Mentions a show where a man becomes a professional bowler after being laid off. It's described as a multicamera comedy. Then it mentions \"Smallwood\" and \"CBS Studios.\" Wait, there's also a part about a show where a surgeon has to supervise her overbearing father. The first part of Document 2 seems to be about different shows. But then there's a mention of \"Good Sam\" in the context of a drama? Wait, let me check again. The user is asking about the drama \"Good Sam.\" \n\nLooking at Document 4: It says \"A talented yet stifled surgeon embraces her leadership role after her renowned and pompous boss falls into a coma. When he awakens and wants to resume surgery, however, it falls to her to supervise this overbearing blowhard who never acknowledged her talents \u2014 and also happens to be her father.\" The pilot cast includes Sophia Bush, Jason Isaacs, Edwin Hodge. The series creator is Katie Wech. Studios are CBS Television Studios and Sutton St. Productions. This sounds like a medical drama, given the surgeon context. \n\nDocument 5: Describes scenes in a hospital with characters like Dr. Sam, Dr. Griff, and Dr. Caleb. It's about a patient refusing surgery and the dynamics between the doctors. This also points towards a medical drama or medical comedy-drama. \n\nDocument 3: Talks about casting details for a series that started filming in 2021-2022. The Rotten Tomatoes score is 63%, Metacritic 56. But no direct mention of genre. However, given that Document 4 and 5 describe medical scenarios, it's likely related. \n\nPutting it together: The show \"Good Sam\" involves a surgeon (Sam) dealing with her father (Griff) who is a surgeon, and there's a medical setting. The genre would be a medical drama",

          "Sam Griffith (Sophia Bush) is a female lead, still a rarity in medical dramas. The cast diversity is notable: Malcolm Kinglsey (Edwin Hodge) is a Black man from a wealthy, prominent family. Wealthy Black Americans aren't usually showcased on television. Malcolm is also a love interest for Sam, adding to the representation of interracial relationships on television. However, most of the diversity comes in the form of the secondary cast (Skye P. Marshall, Omar Maskati, Davi Santos), who are very involved in the main storylines. Did we miss something on diversity?                     Suggest an update.

          "Based on       1 parent review     GOOD SAM plays in the standard medical procedural sandbox, but there is a family drama twist. Samantha Griffith (Sophia Bush) is a competent heart surgeon who became the head of the department after her hard-to-please father, Dr. Rob Griffith (Jason Isaacs), suffered an accident, thereby losing his title as department head. The switch-up leads Sam and her father to try to reconcile their relationship as Sam finds her way as a leader. This show seems to suggest CBS is keeping to its mission to steadily showcase more diverse, complicated storylines. While Good Sam could have easily been just a run-of-the-mill medical show about a problem of the week, the series also entangles its characters in some thorny familial drama. This adds a new layer to what fans of this type of genre might be used to, and thankfully so. Bush, who once headlined another procedural, Chicago P.D., is great at playing a woman who has grown tired of trying to please her father and wants to show her worth as a doctor on her own terms. English actor Isaacs' American accent falters at the beginning of the first episode, but by the time it's ended, you believe he's a difficult man who might have a good heart, but is buried underneath guilt and unresolved trauma.",

Sophia Bush is back on TV for Good Sam, and here's how the CBS drama compares to other current medical shows. Spoilers ahead for the series premiere of Good Sam on CBS. CBS has officially gotten into the medical drama game with the debut of Good Sam, starring Sophia Bush in her big series regular return to network television after her exit from Chicago P.D. in 2017. As Dr. Sam Griffith, Bush \u2013\u00a0in her first turn playing a doctor on TV \u2013\u00a0takes on a leadership role at her hospital by becoming chief of surgery\u2026 with the complication that her father (played by Jason Isaacs) formerly held that position before ending up in a coma after being shot. When he awakes and must work under his daughter, there are more problems than just medical mysteries for Sam to deal with.\u00a0 The show packed a lot into the pilot episode to establish not only Sam and dad Rob \u201cGriff\u201d Griffith, but also her mom and her team of doctors who are used to following Griff\u2019s lead rather than Sam\u2019s. CBS was the only broadcast network without a medical drama prior to Good Sam, and recruiting a TV veteran like Sophia Bush and a big name like Jason Isaacs was a strong way to start. So, how does it compare to the other, long-running medical dramas on TV?",
          "Good Sam is an American medical drama television series created by Katie Wech for CBS, starring  Jason Isaacs and Sophia Bush which premiered on January 5, 2022.[1] In May 2022, the series was canceled after one season.[2]  Heart surgeon Dr. Samantha Griffith (Sophia Bush) becomes the top surgeon at  Lakeshore Sentinel Hospital after her boss and father, Dr. Rob Griffith (Jason Isaacs), falls into a coma. Her life becomes complicated when he awakens and wants to resume surgery, which means Samantha would be supervising him.[3]  On September 19, 2019, CBS put Good Sam into development.[22] Writer Katie Wech produced the series with Jennie Snyder Urman through her Sutton St. Productions and CBS Television Studios.  In February 2020, the series was given a pilot order, with further development paused during the COVID-19 pandemic.[23] On May 14, 2021, the show was given a series order.[24] On May 12, 2022, CBS canceled the series after one season.[2]  In February 2020, Sophia Bush was cast as lead role.[25] In March 2020, Jason Isaacs joined the main cast.[26] In January 2021, Skye P.

          "Type keyword(s) to search  Pilot Script Review of Good Sam  Good Sam is CBS's only contender this year in the medical genre after passing on Under The Bridge last pilot season and ordering none the year before. It comes from in-house producer Jennie Snyder Urman, who created and executive produced Jane The Virgin. She currently serves as executive producer on the CW\u2019s Charmed and CBS\u2019s midseason sitcom Broke. The writer is Katie Wech, who previously worked with Urman as co-executive producer on Jane the Virgin. Prior to Good Sam, she wrote ABC's pilot The Hypnotist\u2019s Love Story, based on the Liane Moriarty book, which didn't make it to series for good reasons (read my script review). Most recently, she was one of the many writers hired for Fox\u2019s summer series BH90210. This is also the second year CBS has developed a drama pilot for Sophia Bush. In 2019, she headlined Surveillance, a suspenseful spy thriller (read my preview) which reportedly \"tested through the roof\" but was ultimately determined not to be a good fit for the network. Will Bush have better luck this time? Read on...  WRITTEN BY: Katie Wech DRAFT DATE: 1/21/20 PAGE COUNT: 60 pages  SCRIPT SYNOPSIS: We open on Detroit's Henry Ford hospital, where we hear the beeping of a heart monitor and some heavy breathing.",
          "The only way to resume his job is as her subordinate, an arrangement which, for him, is untenable. Their interactions work, and Sophia Bush and Jason Isaacs seem like they could be a great pairing. The other characters around them fail to make much of an impression, except for Sam's mother and Griff's ex-wife, Vivian, who's an administrator at the hospital. Oh, and her new husband is also a doctor there. Adding to the intrigue, Sam's best friend Pippa sleeps with Griff! So, yes, there are some seriously intermingled lives at this hospital, and a fair number of twists in the pilot, but it's not clear where the show\u00a0goes from here, and/or whether CBS viewers will be invested enough in its characters to care. FINAL RECOMMENDATION: Good Sam is a solid pilot script with a fair number of twists. The father-daughter relationship at its heart is compelling, and Sophia Bush and Jason Isaacs seem well cast. That said, it doesn't feel like it brings much new to the medical show genre overall, and feels far more soapy than we've come to expect from CBS. It's not clear to me where it could fit in their schedule.

However, the stakes are high now as both of their children also get involved in martial arts tournaments. Just like their opposite karate styles, both men seem to have different approaches to parenting that are reflected in their children\u2019s actions. RELATED:\u00a05 Ways Johnny Is Cobra Kai's Hero (& 5 It's Still Daniel) This is how Cobra Kai feels thematically similar to The Good Sam. Sam wishes to walk in the professional footsteps of her father even though he has his own fallacies. How she seeks to reinvent herself in this context is what adds more substance to the premise.  A satire on the ultra-rich sections of American society, Succession deals with the internal conflicts of the Roy family. As the family's aging patriarch continues to thrive with an iron fist, his children devise to take the reins of his empire. Each of the main characters on Succession is delightfully selfish in their own ways. The result of their actions is a family drama of Shakespearean proportions.\u00a0 If people think Sam Griffith is a harsh dad, they should watch Logan Roy's outbursts at his children in Succession. The latter can be equally hot-headed and scheming, making Succession a treat for fans of well-written family dramas.",

I need to check the provided documents for any information related to these events.\n\nStarting with Document 1: It mentions Quad Wilson picking off Jack Albers and returning it 99 yards for a touchdown in the 2022-23 season's Citrus Bowl, securing a 63-7 victory. The date here is a bit confusing because the 2022-23 season would typically refer to the bowl game played in January 2023. The score is LSU 63-7, so LSU is the winner here. The document is from LSU Athletics, so it's likely they are the ones who won that game.\n\nDocument 3 also talks about LSU's performance in the Citrus Bowl, stating they set records for most points (63) and largest margin of victory (56). This aligns with Document 1's info, confirming LSU's win. The game was against Purdue, as Purdue's record is mentioned as 8-5. So the 2022-23 Citrus Bowl was LSU vs. Purdue, with LSU winning.\n\nNow, for the 2022 Citrus Bowl. The documents don't explicitly mention the 2022 Citrus Bowl. Document 2 refers to a game between Iowa and Kentucky on January 1, 2022, but that's a different game, not the Citrus Bowl. The other documents focus on LSU's 2022-23 season and their Citrus Bowl victory. There's no information provided about the 2022 Citrus Bowl specifically. Since the user is asking about both 2022 and 2023, but only the 2023 (as part of the 2022-23 season) is covered in the documents, I can answer for the 2023 one but not the 2022. However, the user might be conflating the academic year with the calendar year. The Citrus Bowl in 2022 would be part of the 2021-22 season. Since none of the documents mention that, I can't provide the winner for the 2022 Citrus Bowl. The documents only cover the 2023 Citrus Bowl (LS",

            "ORLANDO, Fla. - LSU football certainly woke up feeling the cheesiest on Monday. The No. 16 Tigers (10-4) dominated Purdue (8-6) in the Cheez-It Citrus Bowl at Camping World Stadium, 63-7. LSU punted on its first drive and then proceeded to score touchdowns on its next six drives, finishing off the game with a 99-yard interception and score from safety Quad Wilson. A win heavily favored the Tigers after Purdue coach Jeff Brohm had left the Boilermakers for Louisville, star quarterback Aidan O'Connell and wide receiver Charlie Jones opted out of the game to prepare for the 2023 NFL Draft. Regardless, LSU played a nearly flawless game. The Tigers didn't allow any points until the fourth quarter, and by that time they were already up 49-0. Jayden Daniels and Garrett Nussmeier split reps at quarterback for most of the game until freshman Walker Howard finished off the game in the fourth quarter. With a double-digit win total to finish off coach Brian Kelly's first season, the Tigers can head into the 2023 campaign on a positive note, especially with Daniels and the vast majority of the offense returning. After scoring its first touchdown of the game, LSU made a surprising change. Nussmeier, despite Daniels being healthy and playing well on the last drive, replaced LSU's starter at quarterback.",

After forcing Purdue to punt, the Tigers were awarded an extra 15 yards after a kick-catch interference penalty was enforced.

You can visit SportsLine now to see the model's picks. Here are the college football odds and trends for Purdue vs. LSU:\u00a0 With receivers Kayshon Boutte (NFL opt-out), Jaray Jenkins (NFL opt-out) and Jack Bech (transfer portal) also out, the Tigers will likely want to lean on the run game to ease the burden on quarterback Jayden Daniels. Junior running back Josh Williams is one player the Tigers can turn to. He leads the team's running backs with 97 carries for 532 yards (5.5 average) and is third with six touchdowns. Williams also has 21 receptions for 132 yards (6.3 average). He has rushed for 100 or more yards in three of the 11 games he's played in.",
            "His best game was an 18-carry, 118-yard and one-touchdown performance in a 13-10 win at Arkansas on Nov. 12. In the SEC title game against Georgia, he carried six times for 55 yards (9.2 average), including a 47-yarder. He has been hampered with an ankle injury. Among those leading the defense is senior linebacker Micah Baskerville. He leads the team in tackles with 83, including 39 solo, with one sack for six yards. He also has six pass breakups and one interception he returned for 29 yards and a touchdown. Baskerville has registered nine tackles in each of the last two games, including six solo against Georgia on Dec. 3. He was named to the Butkus Award Watch List for the 2022 season, and was LSU's top returning tackler after finishing second on the team with 83 a year ago. With the Boilermakers' top two pass catchers -- wide receiver Charlie Jones and tight end Payne Durham\u00a0-- declaring for the NFL Draft, junior wide out TJ\u00a0Sheffield will look to take advantage of a bigger role on the offense. Sheffield had 39 receptions for 424 yards (10.9 average) and three touchdowns during the regular season. In the Big Ten title game against Michigan, he caught four passes for 54 yards (13.5 average).",
            "The Tigers forced a turnover on downs to open the second half as senior linebacker Micah Baskerville nearly intercepted Burton on 4th-and-4 from the Purdue 45. Nabers found Daniels for a 5-yard touchdown pass on a trick play. That marked Nabers\u2019 second passing completion of the game, giving him 50 yards through the air and a touchdown to extend the Tigers\u2019 lead to 42-0. With the receiving score, Daniels also became the only LSU quarterback with a passing and receiving touchdown in the same game since at least World War II. Brooks picked off Alaimo at the Purdue 27 with 9:17 remaining in the third quarter. Nabers added to an already impressive day by taking a jet sweep from Nussmeier 75 yards for a touchdown, extending the LSU lead to 49-0 with 3:15 left in the third quarter. On the second play from scrimmage in the fourth quarter, the Boilermakers got on the board as Alaimo found Sheffield for a 16-yard touchdown to make it 49-7 Tigers. True freshman Walker Howard entered at quarterback for LSU, leading the offense to a seven play scoring drive, culminating in a 12-yard touchdown rush up the middle by Derrick Davis Jr. to extend the lead to 56-7.",
            "He immediately started showcasing his arm talent, taking a shot deep to Malik Nabers on his first throw of the game. Like Daniels, he finished the drive with a touchdown. Nussmeier completed 4-of-6 passes on the drive for 39 yards, most notably finding Mason Taylor on third down for 17 yards to get LSU into the red zone. Nussmeier rotated out for Daniels on the next drive which also led to a touchdown. But that drive wasn't his last, as Nussmeier finished the game with 173 passing yards and two touchdowns. His only error came in the third quarter when he threw an interception in the end zone that snapped LSU's six-touchdown streak. But regardless of the result, Nussmeier's early insertion into the game poses an interesting wrinkle for LSU's quarterback's room heading into spring practices. Without three starters on the defensive line and with little to no depth at wide receiver and cornerback, LSU had to shake up its rotations with some new faces even before the game got out of hand in the fourth quarter. On the defensive line, edge rusher Zavier Carter was featured on a few passing downs in the first half while linebacker Mike Jones Jr., who has played limited snaps in the second half of the season, played more with BJ Ojulari opting out for the NFL Draft and Desmond Little in the transfer portal.",

Before going 7-6 in 2021, Oregon State had seven consecutive losing seasons. Now the Beavers are 17-9 over the past two seasons. And with Clemson transfer quarterback DJ Uiagalelei joining the program next season, the Beavers could be a trendy preseason pick to contend for the Pac-12 title.

          "The 2022 Vrbo Citrus Bowl was a heck of a great game, with momentum swings and thrilling, crunch-time drives from either team.\u00a0 But that matters very little to the Hawkeyes and their fans, who will fly back to Iowa with a 20-17 loss to Mark Stoops and the SEC's Kentucky. The Hawkeyes had their destiny in their own hands, with the ball and a timeout, starting at their 25, down 20-17, with 1:48 left to win the game. And the drive started with promise. Iowa advanced to the Kentucky 40 with 48 seconds left. But then, Spencer Petras threw an errant pass into the diving arms of DeAndre Square at the Wildcats' 26. Game over. Here's how it happened. That was just a heck of a drive by Kentucky, highlighted by Wan'Dale Robinson's 52-yard catch-and-run to give him 17 catches for 170 yards so far today. Chris Rodriguez Jr. finished off the eight-play, 80-yard drive with a 6-yard rushing score. Now, can Iowa's much-maligned offense, which has performed considerably better in the second half than it did the first, win the game for this defense? Also: Tyler Linderbaum is back in the game. Iowa went three-and-out. It tried to draw Kentucky offside on a fourth-and-1 but it didn't work so Tory Taylor punted.",
          "The Aggies opened the season 1-5 before closing out the year by winning six of seven to finish 7-6. NMSU won a combined eight games in its previous four seasons, so Kill has executed an incredible turnaround in his first year on the job. Diego Pavia was the star of the bowl win. Pavia threw for 167 yards and two touchdowns and added 65 rushing yards in the win. He picked up several key third-down conversions with his legs in the second half to help his team secure the win. Southern Miss RB Frank Gore Jr.: Frank Gore Jr. ran wild in Southern Miss\u2019 win over Rice in the LendingTree Bowl. Gore set an all-time bowl record with 329 yards on just 21 carries in the 38-24 win. Gore rushed for two touchdowns and also had an 18-yard touchdown catch. The previous single-game bowl rushing record was 317 yards, but Gore surged past that with a 55-yard touchdown run in the final minutes. Southern Miss won a combined six games in 2020 and 2021, but the bowl win over Rice gave the Golden Eagles seven wins for the 2022 season. And with Gore and a significant chunk of this team\u2019s core expected to return, Southern Miss could be a team on the rise in the Sun Belt next season. Eastern Michigan: With a win over San Jose State in the Potato Bowl, EMU notched its first bowl victory since 1987.",
          "Western Kentucky: WKU may have had the most impressive performance of bowl season. The Hilltoppers trounced South Alabama 44-23 in the New Orleans Bowl in a game that was not as close as the final score may indicate. South Alabama was looking for its first-ever bowl win, but WKU jumped out to a 31-3 halftime lead and never looked back, putting up a total of 677 yards by the time the final seconds ticked off. Austin Reed threw for 497 yards and four touchdowns in the win. Air Force: Air Force looked right at home on an incredibly cold night in Fort Worth. The Falcons ran all over Baylor in a 30-15 victory in the Armed Forces Bowl. Air Force rushed for 276 yards and limited Baylor to just 42 rushing yards. With the win, Air Force got to double-digit victories for the third time in four seasons. AFA went 11-2 in 2019 and 10-3 in the past two seasons. In the shortened 2020 season, the Falcons finished 3-3. As a program, Air Force has won four consecutive bowl games. New Mexico State: Year 1 of the Jerry Kill era at New Mexico State ended with a bowl victory. NMSU knocked off Bowling Green 24-19 in the Quick Lane Bowl on Monday to capture the program\u2019s second bowl victory since 1960.",
          "The game was a punt hater\u2019s dream. And it was a nightmare for Ole Miss QB Jaxson Dart. He threw three interceptions and fumbled once. Texas Tech QB Tyler Shough rushed for two TDs and threw for another as the Red Raiders easily held on to a 19-point halftime lead throughout the second half. The loss also meant that Ole Miss ends the season at 8-5 after starting the season 7-0. Oklahoma: The Sooners entered the Cheez-It Bowl shorthanded and as significant underdogs to Florida State. Losing 35-32 was still a cover for Oklahoma. But the loss also means that Oklahoma finishes the season at 6-7. That\u2019s the first losing season for OU since 1998. The first year of the Brent Venables era was a bit rocky \u2014 especially when you consider the success that Caleb Williams and Lincoln Riley had at USC. But there\u2019s no reason to panic in Norman. Yet. SMU: The Mustangs entered the New Mexico Bowl as 4.5-point favorites over a BYU team that started freshman third-string QB Sol-Jay Maiava-Peters for the first time. Yet BYU did just enough on the ground to eke out a 24-23 win after stopping an SMU two-point conversion with eight seconds left.",
          "Head coach Kirk Ferentz has kept things close to the vest with his signal-callers, but it's looking like Petras, who started the season as the starter and ended the season as the starter, will get the nod. Star running back Tyler Goodson opted out of the Citrus Bowl for the Hawkeyes as he prepares for the NFL Draft. Freshman receiver Keagan Johnson has also been ruled out for the Citrus Bowl.",
          "Georgia Southern: The Camellia Bowl was a painful watch if you were an Eagles fan. Buffalo beat Georgia Southern 23-21 after going 12-of-19 on third down while averaging less than three yards a carry. In addition to being unable to consistently stop Buffalo on third down, Georgia Southern players dropped multiple catchable passes. Kyle Vantrease threw for 352 yards on 45 attempts and hit Joshua Thompson on a 79-yard TD. But Georgia Southern never got the ball back after pulling within two with 3:38 to go because of two crucial third down conversions by the Bulls to run out the clock. Oklahoma State: The Cowboys entered the Guaranteed Rate Bowl as underdogs to Wisconsin, so OSU\u2019s 24-17 loss to the Badgers wasn\u2019t terribly surprising. But it\u2019s still worth noting just how poorly OSU finished the season. The Cowboys started the season 6-1 and finished 7-6 after ending the season on a 1-5 run. Yeah, Oklahoma State played the final two games of the season without QB Spencer Sanders, but the biggest culprit for the collapse was the regression of the defense in 2022. A testy Mike Gundy didn\u2019t want to talk about any potential staff changes after the game and we\u2019re not going to be surprised if there are some staff announcements forthcoming from OSU in the near future.",
          "Iowa QBs combined to throw for seven TDs all season while the defense itself scored six touchdowns. UCLA: UCLA had a meltdown in the Sun Bowl, blowing a 14-point lead in a loss to Pitt. The Bruins led 28-14 midway through the third quarter but allowed Pitt to come back and win 37-35 with a field goal in the final seconds. In his final college game, Dorian Thompson-Robinson threw three costly interceptions. Two came deep in Pitt territory and the third came deep in his own territory, giving the Panthers a short field to tie the game at 28-28 early in the fourth. To make matters worse, UCLA fumbled the ensuing kickoff to allow Pitt to take the lead. Later in the fourth, UCLA scored with 34 seconds to go to take a 35-34 lead. It looked like it would be the game-winner, but the defense allowed Pitt to go 46 yards in 30 seconds and kick the game-winning field goal. Brutal. UCLA has not won a bowl game since the 2014 season. Ole Miss: The Rebels had 11 drives that didn\u2019t end in points in a 42-25 loss to Texas Tech in the Texas Bowl. Ole Miss turned the ball over five times, gave up the ball five times on downs and punted once. While the Rebels were just 2-of-7 on fourth downs, Texas Tech was 5-of-6.",

But nothing effective, either. Well, that was not very difficult. After Iowa's empty possession to start the day, Kentucky responded with a methodical 13-play, 80-yard scoring drive that ate up 7:28 of clock. Quarterback Will Levis capped it with a 5-yard touchdown pass to running back Chris Rodriguez Jr. The Wildcats converted on two third downs\u00a0\u2014 a third-and-3 at their 42 (they got a 5-yard run) and a third-and-4 at Iowa's 29 (they got a 14-yard completion). Nothing doing on the Hawkeyes' first possession. Spencer Petras started with a 12-yard completion to Sam LaPorta on the game's first play, but Iowa went three-and-out from there. Kentucky will take over at its 20 after Tory Taylor's punt went into the end zone. Spencer Petras was on the field for the first snap. Start question, answered. Looking for some pregame reading? Here's Register columnist Chad Leistikow with his prediction for the Citrus Bowl. There was a lot of talk about whether it'd\u00a0be Spencer Petras or Alex Padilla behind center for the Hawkeyes today.",
          "The freshman Maiava-Peters threw for just 47 yards and an interception but rushed 14 times for 96 yards while Christopher Brooks rushed 19 times for 88 yards. SMU didn\u2019t have receiver Rashee Rice but still had just 218 yards passing on 37 pass attempts. UTSA: The Roadrunners are still searching for their first bowl win after losing 18-12 to Troy in the Cure Bowl. It was an absolutely ugly performance from UTSA too. Without offensive coordinator Will Stein (now the OC at Oregon), the proficient UTSA offense committed five turnovers. The Roadrunners also had nine penalties for 104 yards and many of those penalties came at critical times. A win over the Trojans would have been a big boost to a UTSA team making a step up to the AAC in 2023. NC State: Dave Doeren's risk-averse decision-making may have cost his team a bowl win. NC State lost the Duke's Mayo Bowl 16-12. In the loss, Doeren decided to kick field goals twice inside the Maryland 10-yard line. In the first half, Doeren kicked on fourth-and-goal from the 2. And when his team trailed 13-9 midway through the fourth, Doeren sent his kicker out instead of going for it on fourth-and-3 from the 9.",
          "It\u2019s been a long time coming. Before Chris Creighton arrived as head coach in 2014, the 1987 California Bowl was the program\u2019s last bowl trip. Since then, Creighton brought the Eagles to five bowl games, but this year was the first time EMU pulled out the victory. With the win, EMU finished 9-4 for the season. That\u2019s the second-most wins in a season in program history. Kentucky: The Wildcats made sure that the Music City Bowl was going to hit the under in a 21-0 loss to Iowa. The total for the game was 31 and the lowest total for a bowl game in decades. It was also the lowest total of any game this season after Iowa and Minnesota had a pregame total of 31.5 in what turned out to be a 13-10 game. And just like that Iowa win, this game went under too. The two teams combined for fewer than 400 total yards and punted the ball 18 times with just 21 first downs between them. It was as ugly as an offensive performance as we all expected, especially from Kentucky. Freshman QB Destin Wade started in place of Will Levis and threw two pick sixes in the second quarter. The loss drops the Wildcats to 7-6 in what ultimately is a disappointing season while Iowa finishes at 8-5 despite its remarkable offensive futility throughout the season.",
          "The NC State offense struggled mightily all day, and that ended up being the final scoring opportunity of the game for NC State. San Diego State: The Aztecs turned the ball over five times in a 25-23 loss to Middle Tennessee in the Hawaii Bowl. The Blue Raiders had just 170 yards in the win and threw for 236 yards. Yes, you read that correctly. Thanks to sacks, MTSU had a remarkable -66 rushing yards on 30 attempts. And still won the game. SDSU QB Jalen Mayden threw three interceptions and also had a fumble. The Aztecs\u2019 final turnover came with 55 seconds to go on a 4th and 24 when Tyrell Shavers fumbled the ball after a 12-yard gain. Cincinnati: It was a listless performance for the Bearcats in a 24-7 loss to Louisville in the Fenway Bowl. Cincinnati had just 127 yards of total offense and allowed 419 yards to the Cardinals. Cincy got just 10 first downs and rushed for 44 yards on 38 attempts after sacks were factored in. Louisville even turned the ball over four times to Cincinnati\u2019s two and the game still wasn\u2019t close. If you didn\u2019t know any better, you would have assumed that Scott Satterfield had gone to a far worse team when he left Louisville for Cincy before the bowl game.",

UCLA took a 35-34 lead with 34 seconds remaining, but Patti quickly led the Panthers into field goal range, allowing Ben Sauls to boot his fourth field goal of the game. This one, a 47-yarder, was the game-winner. Pitt coach Pat Narduzzi has already indicated that Patti won't be back next season. So if that was Patti's final college game, he went out with a bang. Fresno State: After a 1-4 start, Fresno State closed out the season with nine consecutive wins. After beating Boise State in the Mountain West title game, the Bulldogs cruised past Washington State 29-6 in the LA Bowl to get to 10 wins for the fourth time in the last six seasons. In the process, Fresno State became the first team in FBS history to get to 10 wins after losing four of five to start the season. The LA Bowl was the final college game for Jake Haener and he went out in style. Haener threw for 280 yards and two touchdowns while Jordan Mims rushed out for 209 yards and had two scores of his own. Duke: Duke went from winless in ACC play in 2021 to nine wins in 2022.",

With the win, Duke got to nine wins for the first time since 2014. Mike Elko has done one of the best coaching jobs in the country in his first season with the Blue Devils. The program was barely competitive in David Cutcliffe\u2019s final seasons on the job, going a combined 5-18 (1-17 ACC) in his final two years. With Wednesday\u2019s win, Duke finished the season 9-4 overall with a 5-3 mark in ACC play. It was just the third season in school history that the Blue Devils had finished with a winning conference record and won a bowl game. Washington: After going 4-8 in 2021, Washington capped off a tremendous turnaround by beating Texas 27-20 in the Alamo Bowl. With the win, Washington finished the season with 11 wins \u2014 the most it has had in a season since 2016. That's the year the Huskies reached the College Football Playoff. After coming over from Fresno State, head coach Kalen DeBoer was able to revitalize the program in just one season. The addition of quarterback Michael Penix Jr. played a big role. Penix, who will return next season, threw for 287 yards and two touchdowns in the bowl win.",

          "After a disastrous first play that saw Kentucky log a 10-yard run and get an extra 10 yards to Iowa's 11, the Hawkeye defense shored up and forced the Wildcats to settle for another field goal after they intercepted Patras at the 31. Spencer Petras' second-and-11 pass was tipped at the line of scrimmage and intercepted, and Kentucky will take over at Iowa's\u00a031-yard line. Oh dear ... that was painful for Hawkeye fans. Zach VanValkenburg and Joe Evans secured back-to-back sacks to force Kentucky into a third-and-26 from its 46-yard line. Then ... Will Levis connected with Wan'Dale Robinson for a 34-yard completion down the middle, right in the hole of Iowa's defense. The Hawkeyes were able to force the Wildcats into a 21-yard field goal, so that was a win. But still, not getting off the field on a third-and-24 is rough. It was another long, methodical drive\u00a0\u2014 14 plays, 72 yards, 8:15 of time. My goodness, it's hot down there. On-field temperatures are well above 100 degrees in Orlando, Florida, at Camping World Stadium for the Citrus Bowl. Not quite the 10-degree winter weather we're getting here in Iowa, eh? Iowa's offense showed some good things on a scoring drive that led to a 28-yard field goal from Caleb Shudak.",

But on a fourth-and-inches at Kentucky's 11, the Hawkeyes were aggressive and wanted the touchdown ... but Petras and Tyler Linderbaum couldn't connect on the snap and Petras fell on the ball behind the line of scrimmage. Seven plays, 69 yards ... no points. This stat from Register columnist Chad Leistikow is damning. The Hawkeyes were able to gain a few chunks of yards, to get close enough for a last-second Hail Mary from Spencer Petras. It was intercepted. To halftime we go, and the Wildcats start the second half with the ball. Petras went 10-for-16 for 82 yards and two interceptions. Gavin Williams led the backfield with five carries for 25 yards. This half has been pretty much all Kentucky, with the Wildcats out-possessing Iowa 19:22 to 10:38. They're also 4-for-7 on third-down attempts, while Iowa is 0-for-4. Another save from the Hawkeye defense.",
          "A hard play-action on second down, then a little screen to Sam LaPorta running behind Mason Richman and Tyler Linderbaum as lead blockers. It worked to perfection for a 36-yard touchdown pass. What a drive\u00a0\u2014 nine plays, 92 yards, 3:15 of clock. Iowa has looked like an entirely different team in this second half. Big plays from Jack Campbell spearheaded Iowa's defensive effort to stall Kentucky near midfield, and now the Hawkeyes take over at their 8-yard line, down 13-10. And Gavin Williams starts the drive with a 19-yard run. Can you say momentum swing? We've got ourselves a game, folks. Good things usually happen when Arland Bruce IV, who was an All-Iowa Elite Team running back in his senior season at Ankeny, gets the ball in the backfield. The true freshman capped a six-play, 50-yard drive with a 20-yard rushing score on a jet sweep, a play that's traditionally been kind to the Hawkeyes. LeShon Williams also logged two carries for 20 yards on that drive. Iowa already has 119 total yards in the second half, which nearly matches their whole first-half total. Iowa's defense came out of the half well and forced a Kentucky punt.",

I need to check the provided documents to find the correct information.\n\nFirst, looking at Document 1: It mentions the film debuted on HBO Max on Feb 11, 2022. But wait, Document 2 says the premiere was on January 2, 2022, at 9pm ET/PT on CNN. Then Document 3 states that Frank Marshall is set to direct the film, which will premiere on CNN before streaming on HBO Max. Document 4 lists the release date as January 2, 2022, in the US. Document 5 confirms Frank Marshall as the director.\n\nHmm, there's a discrepancy here. Document 1 says Feb 11, 2022, for HBO Max, while Document 2 and 4 mention January 2, 2022, as the premiere date on CNN. The user is asking about the premiere date, which is likely the first time it was shown. So the CNN premiere was January 2, 2022, and then it moved to HBO Max later. The director is Frank Marshall according to Document 3 and 5. So the correct answer should be Frank Marshall as director and January 2, 2022, as the premiere date. The February date is for the HBO Max debut, but the premiere was earlier on CNN. The user might be considering the CNN premiere as the official premiere date. So the answer combines the director from Document 3 and the premiere date from Document 2 and 4.\n</think>\n\nThe director of *Carole King & James Taylor: Just Call Out My Name* is **Frank Marshall**, and its premiere was on **January 2, 2022** (as stated in Documents 2, 3, 4, and 5). The film later debuted on HBO Max on February 11, 2022 (Document 1), but the initial premiere occurred on CNN on the earlier date.",

            "ORLANDO, Fla. - LSU football certainly woke up feeling the cheesiest on Monday. The No. 16 Tigers (10-4) dominated Purdue (8-6) in the Cheez-It Citrus Bowl at Camping World Stadium, 63-7. LSU punted on its first drive and then proceeded to score touchdowns on its next six drives, finishing off the game with a 99-yard interception and score from safety Quad Wilson. A win heavily favored the Tigers after Purdue coach Jeff Brohm had left the Boilermakers for Louisville, star quarterback Aidan O'Connell and wide receiver Charlie Jones opted out of the game to prepare for the 2023 NFL Draft. Regardless, LSU played a nearly flawless game. The Tigers didn't allow any points until the fourth quarter, and by that time they were already up 49-0. Jayden Daniels and Garrett Nussmeier split reps at quarterback for most of the game until freshman Walker Howard finished off the game in the fourth quarter. With a double-digit win total to finish off coach Brian Kelly's first season, the Tigers can head into the 2023 campaign on a positive note, especially with Daniels and the vast majority of the offense returning. After scoring its first touchdown of the game, LSU made a surprising change. Nussmeier, despite Daniels being healthy and playing well on the last drive, replaced LSU's starter at quarterback.",

Junior running back Josh Williams is one player the Tigers can turn to. He leads the team's running backs with 97 carries for 532 yards (5.5 average) and is third with six touchdowns. Williams also has 21 receptions for 132 yards (6.3 average). He has rushed for 100 or more yards in three of the 11 games he's played in.",
            "His best game was an 18-carry, 118-yard and one-touchdown performance in a 13-10 win at Arkansas on Nov. 12. In the SEC title game against Georgia, he carried six times for 55 yards (9.2 average), including a 47-yarder. He has been hampered with an ankle injury. Among those leading the defense is senior linebacker Micah Baskerville. He leads the team in tackles with 83, including 39 solo, with one sack for six yards. He also has six pass breakups and one interception he returned for 29 yards and a touchdown. Baskerville has registered nine tackles in each of the last two games, including six solo against Georgia on Dec. 3. He was named to the Butkus Award Watch List for the 2022 season, and was LSU's top returning tackler after finishing second on the team with 83 a year ago. With the Boilermakers' top two pass catchers -- wide receiver Charlie Jones and tight end Payne Durham\u00a0-- declaring for the NFL Draft, junior wide out TJ\u00a0Sheffield will look to take advantage of a bigger role on the offense. Sheffield had 39 receptions for 424 yards (10.9 average) and three touchdowns during the regular season. In the Big Ten title game against Michigan, he caught four passes for 54 yards (13.5 average).",

            "He immediately started showcasing his arm talent, taking a shot deep to Malik Nabers on his first throw of the game. Like Daniels, he finished the drive with a touchdown. Nussmeier completed 4-of-6 passes on the drive for 39 yards, most notably finding Mason Taylor on third down for 17 yards to get LSU into the red zone. Nussmeier rotated out for Daniels on the next drive which also led to a touchdown. But that drive wasn't his last, as Nussmeier finished the game with 173 passing yards and two touchdowns. His only error came in the third quarter when he threw an interception in the end zone that snapped LSU's six-touchdown streak. But regardless of the result, Nussmeier's early insertion into the game poses an interesting wrinkle for LSU's quarterback's room heading into spring practices. Without three starters on the defensive line and with little to no depth at wide receiver and cornerback, LSU had to shake up its rotations with some new faces even before the game got out of hand in the fourth quarter. On the defensive line, edge rusher Zavier Carter was featured on a few passing downs in the first half while linebacker Mike Jones Jr., who has played limited snaps in the second half of the season, played more with BJ Ojulari opting out for the NFL Draft and Desmond Little in the transfer portal.",

The Hawkeyes had their destiny in their own hands, with the ball and a timeout, starting at their 25, down 20-17, with 1:48 left to win the game. And the drive started with promise. Iowa advanced to the Kentucky 40 with 48 seconds left. But then, Spencer Petras threw an errant pass into the diving arms of DeAndre Square at the Wildcats' 26. Game over. Here's how it happened. That was just a heck of a drive by Kentucky, highlighted by Wan'Dale Robinson's 52-yard catch-and-run to give him 17 catches for 170 yards so far today. Chris Rodriguez Jr. finished off the eight-play, 80-yard drive with a 6-yard rushing score. Now, can Iowa's much-maligned offense, which has performed considerably better in the second half than it did the first, win the game for this defense? Also: Tyler Linderbaum is back in the game.

Pavia threw for 167 yards and two touchdowns and added 65 rushing yards in the win. He picked up several key third-down conversions with his legs in the second half to help his team secure the win.

Austin Reed threw for 497 yards and four touchdowns in the win. Air Force: Air Force looked right at home on an incredibly cold night in Fort Worth. The Falcons ran all over Baylor in a 30-15 victory in the Armed Forces Bowl. Air Force rushed for 276 yards and limited Baylor to just 42 rushing yards. With the win, Air Force got to double-digit victories for the third time in four seasons. AFA went 11-2 in 2019 and 10-3 in the past two seasons. In the shortened 2020 season, the Falcons finished 3-3. As a program, Air Force has won four consecutive bowl games. New Mexico State: Year 1 of the Jerry Kill era at New Mexico State ended with a bowl victory. NMSU knocked off Bowling Green 24-19 in the Quick Lane Bowl on Monday to capture the program\u2019s second bowl victory since 1960.",
          "The game was a punt hater\u2019s dream. And it was a nightmare for Ole Miss QB Jaxson Dart. He threw three interceptions and fumbled once. Texas Tech QB Tyler Shough rushed for two TDs and threw for another as the Red Raiders easily held on to a 19-point halftime lead throughout the second half. The loss also meant that Ole Miss ends the season at 8-5 after starting the season 7-0. Oklahoma: The Sooners entered the Cheez-It Bowl shorthanded and as significant underdogs to Florida State. Losing 35-32 was still a cover for Oklahoma. But the loss also means that Oklahoma finishes the season at 6-7. That\u2019s the first losing season for OU since 1998. The first year of the Brent Venables era was a bit rocky \u2014 especially when you consider the success that Caleb Williams and Lincoln Riley had at USC. But there\u2019s no reason to panic in Norman. Yet. SMU: The Mustangs entered the New Mexico Bowl as 4.5-point favorites over a BYU team that started freshman third-string QB Sol-Jay Maiava-Peters for the first time. Yet BYU did just enough on the ground to eke out a 24-23 win after stopping an SMU two-point conversion with eight seconds left.",
          "Head coach Kirk Ferentz has kept things close to the vest with his signal-callers, but it's looking like Petras, who started the season as the starter and ended the season as the starter, will get the nod. Star running back Tyler Goodson opted out of the Citrus Bowl for the Hawkeyes as he prepares for the NFL Draft. Freshman receiver Keagan Johnson has also been ruled out for the Citrus Bowl.",
          "Georgia Southern: The Camellia Bowl was a painful watch if you were an Eagles fan. Buffalo beat Georgia Southern 23-21 after going 12-of-19 on third down while averaging less than three yards a carry. In addition to being unable to consistently stop Buffalo on third down, Georgia Southern players dropped multiple catchable passes. Kyle Vantrease threw for 352 yards on 45 attempts and hit Joshua Thompson on a 79-yard TD. But Georgia Southern never got the ball back after pulling within two with 3:38 to go because of two crucial third down conversions by the Bulls to run out the clock. Oklahoma State: The Cowboys entered the Guaranteed Rate Bowl as underdogs to Wisconsin, so OSU\u2019s 24-17 loss to the Badgers wasn\u2019t terribly surprising. But it\u2019s still worth noting just how poorly OSU finished the season. The Cowboys started the season 6-1 and finished 7-6 after ending the season on a 1-5 run. Yeah, Oklahoma State played the final two games of the season without QB Spencer Sanders, but the biggest culprit for the collapse was the regression of the defense in 2022. A testy Mike Gundy didn\u2019t want to talk about any potential staff changes after the game and we\u2019re not going to be surprised if there are some staff announcements forthcoming from OSU in the near future.",
          "Iowa QBs combined to throw for seven TDs all season while the defense itself scored six touchdowns. UCLA: UCLA had a meltdown in the Sun Bowl, blowing a 14-point lead in a loss to Pitt. The Bruins led 28-14 midway through the third quarter but allowed Pitt to come back and win 37-35 with a field goal in the final seconds. In his final college game, Dorian Thompson-Robinson threw three costly interceptions. Two came deep in Pitt territory and the third came deep in his own territory, giving the Panthers a short field to tie the game at 28-28 early in the fourth. To make matters worse, UCLA fumbled the ensuing kickoff to allow Pitt to take the lead. Later in the fourth, UCLA scored with 34 seconds to go to take a 35-34 lead. It looked like it would be the game-winner, but the defense allowed Pitt to go 46 yards in 30 seconds and kick the game-winning field goal. Brutal. UCLA has not won a bowl game since the 2014 season. Ole Miss: The Rebels had 11 drives that didn\u2019t end in points in a 42-25 loss to Texas Tech in the Texas Bowl. Ole Miss turned the ball over five times, gave up the ball five times on downs and punted once. While the Rebels were just 2-of-7 on fourth downs, Texas Tech was 5-of-6.",
          "Gavin Williams,\u00a0LeShon Williams and Arland Bruce IV\u00a0have taken the five total rushes and Spencer Petras is 3-for-5 for 18 yards so far. Nothing hideous. But nothing effective, either. Well, that was not very difficult. After Iowa's empty possession to start the day, Kentucky responded with a methodical 13-play, 80-yard scoring drive that ate up 7:28 of clock. Quarterback Will Levis capped it with a 5-yard touchdown pass to running back Chris Rodriguez Jr. The Wildcats converted on two third downs\u00a0\u2014 a third-and-3 at their 42 (they got a 5-yard run) and a third-and-4 at Iowa's 29 (they got a 14-yard completion). Nothing doing on the Hawkeyes' first possession. Spencer Petras started with a 12-yard completion to Sam LaPorta on the game's first play, but Iowa went three-and-out from there. Kentucky will take over at its 20 after Tory Taylor's punt went into the end zone. Spencer Petras was on the field for the first snap. Start question, answered. Looking for some pregame reading? Here's Register columnist Chad Leistikow with his prediction for the Citrus Bowl. There was a lot of talk about whether it'd\u00a0be Spencer Petras or Alex Padilla behind center for the Hawkeyes today.",
          "The freshman Maiava-Peters threw for just 47 yards and an interception but rushed 14 times for 96 yards while Christopher Brooks rushed 19 times for 88 yards. SMU didn\u2019t have receiver Rashee Rice but still had just 218 yards passing on 37 pass attempts. UTSA: The Roadrunners are still searching for their first bowl win after losing 18-12 to Troy in the Cure Bowl. It was an absolutely ugly performance from UTSA too. Without offensive coordinator Will Stein (now the OC at Oregon), the proficient UTSA offense committed five turnovers. The Roadrunners also had nine penalties for 104 yards and many of those penalties came at critical times. A win over the Trojans would have been a big boost to a UTSA team making a step up to the AAC in 2023. NC State: Dave Doeren's risk-averse decision-making may have cost his team a bowl win. NC State lost the Duke's Mayo Bowl 16-12. In the loss, Doeren decided to kick field goals twice inside the Maryland 10-yard line. In the first half, Doeren kicked on fourth-and-goal from the 2. And when his team trailed 13-9 midway through the fourth, Doeren sent his kicker out instead of going for it on fourth-and-3 from the 9.",
          "It\u2019s been a long time coming. Before Chris Creighton arrived as head coach in 2014, the 1987 California Bowl was the program\u2019s last bowl trip. Since then, Creighton brought the Eagles to five bowl games, but this year was the first time EMU pulled out the victory. With the win, EMU finished 9-4 for the season. That\u2019s the second-most wins in a season in program history. Kentucky: The Wildcats made sure that the Music City Bowl was going to hit the under in a 21-0 loss to Iowa. The total for the game was 31 and the lowest total for a bowl game in decades. It was also the lowest total of any game this season after Iowa and Minnesota had a pregame total of 31.5 in what turned out to be a 13-10 game. And just like that Iowa win, this game went under too. The two teams combined for fewer than 400 total yards and punted the ball 18 times with just 21 first downs between them. It was as ugly as an offensive performance as we all expected, especially from Kentucky. Freshman QB Destin Wade started in place of Will Levis and threw two pick sixes in the second quarter. The loss drops the Wildcats to 7-6 in what ultimately is a disappointing season while Iowa finishes at 8-5 despite its remarkable offensive futility throughout the season.",
          "The NC State offense struggled mightily all day, and that ended up being the final scoring opportunity of the game for NC State. San Diego State: The Aztecs turned the ball over five times in a 25-23 loss to Middle Tennessee in the Hawaii Bowl. The Blue Raiders had just 170 yards in the win and threw for 236 yards. Yes, you read that correctly. Thanks to sacks, MTSU had a remarkable -66 rushing yards on 30 attempts. And still won the game. SDSU QB Jalen Mayden threw three interceptions and also had a fumble. The Aztecs\u2019 final turnover came with 55 seconds to go on a 4th and 24 when Tyrell Shavers fumbled the ball after a 12-yard gain. Cincinnati: It was a listless performance for the Bearcats in a 24-7 loss to Louisville in the Fenway Bowl. Cincinnati had just 127 yards of total offense and allowed 419 yards to the Cardinals. Cincy got just 10 first downs and rushed for 44 yards on 38 attempts after sacks were factored in. Louisville even turned the ball over four times to Cincinnati\u2019s two and the game still wasn\u2019t close. If you didn\u2019t know any better, you would have assumed that Scott Satterfield had gone to a far worse team when he left Louisville for Cincy before the bowl game.",
          "He threw for 224 yards and ran for 73 more, including a gutsy 11-yard scramble that set up the game-winning field goal. UCLA took a 35-34 lead with 34 seconds remaining, but Patti quickly led the Panthers into field goal range, allowing Ben Sauls to boot his fourth field goal of the game. This one, a 47-yarder, was the game-winner. Pitt coach Pat Narduzzi has already indicated that Patti won't be back next season. So if that was Patti's final college game, he went out with a bang. Fresno State: After a 1-4 start, Fresno State closed out the season with nine consecutive wins. After beating Boise State in the Mountain West title game, the Bulldogs cruised past Washington State 29-6 in the LA Bowl to get to 10 wins for the fourth time in the last six seasons. In the process, Fresno State became the first team in FBS history to get to 10 wins after losing four of five to start the season. The LA Bowl was the final college game for Jake Haener and he went out in style. Haener threw for 280 yards and two touchdowns while Jordan Mims rushed out for 209 yards and had two scores of his own. Duke: Duke went from winless in ACC play in 2021 to nine wins in 2022.",
          "Duke capped off a remarkable season by beating UCF 30-13 on Wednesday in the Military Bowl \u2014 the program\u2019s first bowl win since 2018. With the win, Duke got to nine wins for the first time since 2014. Mike Elko has done one of the best coaching jobs in the country in his first season with the Blue Devils. The program was barely competitive in David Cutcliffe\u2019s final seasons on the job, going a combined 5-18 (1-17 ACC) in his final two years. With Wednesday\u2019s win, Duke finished the season 9-4 overall with a 5-3 mark in ACC play. It was just the third season in school history that the Blue Devils had finished with a winning conference record and won a bowl game. Washington: After going 4-8 in 2021, Washington capped off a tremendous turnaround by beating Texas 27-20 in the Alamo Bowl. With the win, Washington finished the season with 11 wins \u2014 the most it has had in a season since 2016. That's the year the Huskies reached the College Football Playoff. After coming over from Fresno State, head coach Kalen DeBoer was able to revitalize the program in just one season. The addition of quarterback Michael Penix Jr. played a big role. Penix, who will return next season, threw for 287 yards and two touchdowns in the bowl win.",

          "After a disastrous first play that saw Kentucky log a 10-yard run and get an extra 10 yards to Iowa's 11, the Hawkeye defense shored up and forced the Wildcats to settle for another field goal after they intercepted Patras at the 31. Spencer Petras' second-and-11 pass was tipped at the line of scrimmage and intercepted, and Kentucky will take over at Iowa's\u00a031-yard line. Oh dear ... that was painful for Hawkeye fans. Zach VanValkenburg and Joe Evans secured back-to-back sacks to force Kentucky into a third-and-26 from its 46-yard line. Then ... Will Levis connected with Wan'Dale Robinson for a 34-yard completion down the middle, right in the hole of Iowa's defense. The Hawkeyes were able to force the Wildcats into a 21-yard field goal, so that was a win. But still, not getting off the field on a third-and-24 is rough. It was another long, methodical drive\u00a0\u2014 14 plays, 72 yards, 8:15 of time. My goodness, it's hot down there. On-field temperatures are well above 100 degrees in Orlando, Florida, at Camping World Stadium for the Citrus Bowl. Not quite the 10-degree winter weather we're getting here in Iowa, eh? Iowa's offense showed some good things on a scoring drive that led to a 28-yard field goal from Caleb Shudak.",
          "The the offense responded with its best drive of the day, featuring a gorgeous 34-yard completion from Spencer Petras to Sam LaPorta and 27 hard-earned yards from Gavin Williams on three carries. But on a fourth-and-inches at Kentucky's 11, the Hawkeyes were aggressive and wanted the touchdown ... but Petras and Tyler Linderbaum couldn't connect on the snap and Petras fell on the ball behind the line of scrimmage. Seven plays, 69 yards ... no points. This stat from Register columnist Chad Leistikow is damning. The Hawkeyes were able to gain a few chunks of yards, to get close enough for a last-second Hail Mary from Spencer Petras. It was intercepted. To halftime we go, and the Wildcats start the second half with the ball. Petras went 10-for-16 for 82 yards and two interceptions. Gavin Williams led the backfield with five carries for 25 yards. This half has been pretty much all Kentucky, with the Wildcats out-possessing Iowa 19:22 to 10:38. They're also 4-for-7 on third-down attempts, while Iowa is 0-for-4. Another save from the Hawkeye defense.",
          "A hard play-action on second down, then a little screen to Sam LaPorta running behind Mason Richman and Tyler Linderbaum as lead blockers. It worked to perfection for a 36-yard touchdown pass. What a drive\u00a0\u2014 nine plays, 92 yards, 3:15 of clock. Iowa has looked like an entirely different team in this second half. Big plays from Jack Campbell spearheaded Iowa's defensive effort to stall Kentucky near midfield, and now the Hawkeyes take over at their 8-yard line, down 13-10. And Gavin Williams starts the drive with a 19-yard run. Can you say momentum swing? We've got ourselves a game, folks. Good things usually happen when Arland Bruce IV, who was an All-Iowa Elite Team running back in his senior season at Ankeny, gets the ball in the backfield. The true freshman capped a six-play, 50-yard drive with a 20-yard rushing score on a jet sweep, a play that's traditionally been kind to the Hawkeyes. LeShon Williams also logged two carries for 20 yards on that drive. Iowa already has 119 total yards in the second half, which nearly matches their whole first-half total. Iowa's defense came out of the half well and forced a Kentucky punt.",

The No. 16 Tigers (10-4) dominated Purdue (8-6) in the Cheez-It Citrus Bowl at Camping World Stadium, 63-7. LSU punted on its first drive and then proceeded to score touchdowns on its next six drives, finishing off the game with a 99-yard interception and score from safety Quad Wilson. A win heavily favored the Tigers after Purdue coach Jeff Brohm had left the Boilermakers for Louisville, star quarterback Aidan O'Connell and wide receiver Charlie Jones opted out of the game to prepare for the 2023 NFL Draft. Regardless, LSU played a nearly flawless game. The Tigers didn't allow any points until the fourth quarter, and by that time they were already up 49-0. Jayden Daniels and Garrett Nussmeier split reps at quarterback for most of the game until freshman Walker Howard finished off the game in the fourth quarter. With a double-digit win total to finish off coach Brian Kelly's first season, the Tigers can head into the 2023 campaign on a positive note, especially with Daniels and the vast majority of the offense returning. After scoring its first touchdown of the game, LSU made a surprising change. Nussmeier, despite Daniels being healthy and playing well on the last drive, replaced LSU's starter at quarterback.",

            "The drive culminated in a 1-yard scoring run from senior running back John Emery to give the Tigers a 7-0 lead with 7:01 remaining in the first quarter of action. After forcing Purdue to punt, the Tigers were awarded an extra 15 yards after a kick-catch interference penalty was enforced. Gregory Clayton fair caught the football at the LSU 18 and the penalty moved the ball to the 33. Nussmeier entered at quarterback on LSU\u2019s third offensive possession of the game. On 3rd-and-4, Nussmeier found Taylor for an 17-yard completion and first down to the Purdue 14. Noah Cain rushed up the middle for a 9-yard touchdown, extending the lead to 14-0 with 1:06 to play in the first quarter.\u00a0 It was a strong start for the LSU defense, holding Purdue to just four pass yards and 17 rush yards in the first quarter of play. Daniels returned at quarterback for the Tigers, finding Nabers for a 17-yard connection to the Purdue 46 and then finding Taylor for a 32-yard touchdown completion, creating some separation with an early 21-0 advantage with 13:03 to play in the second quarter.\u00a0 On their next offensive possession, Daniels went back to Taylor for a 15-yard completion over the middle of the field to the LSU 45. Taylor had five catches for 83 yards, averaging 20.",

Here are the college football odds and trends for Purdue vs. LSU:\u00a0 With receivers Kayshon Boutte (NFL opt-out), Jaray Jenkins (NFL opt-out) and Jack Bech (transfer portal) also out, the Tigers will likely want to lean on the run game to ease the burden on quarterback Jayden Daniels. Junior running back Josh Williams is one player the Tigers can turn to. He leads the team's running backs with 97 carries for 532 yards (5.5 average) and is third with six touchdowns. Williams also has 21 receptions for 132 yards (6.3 average). He has rushed for 100 or more yards in three of the 11 games he's played in.",
            "His best game was an 18-carry, 118-yard and one-touchdown performance in a 13-10 win at Arkansas on Nov. 12. In the SEC title game against Georgia, he carried six times for 55 yards (9.2 average), including a 47-yarder. He has been hampered with an ankle injury. Among those leading the defense is senior linebacker Micah Baskerville. He leads the team in tackles with 83, including 39 solo, with one sack for six yards. He also has six pass breakups and one interception he returned for 29 yards and a touchdown. Baskerville has registered nine tackles in each of the last two games, including six solo against Georgia on Dec. 3. He was named to the Butkus Award Watch List for the 2022 season, and was LSU's top returning tackler after finishing second on the team with 83 a year ago. With the Boilermakers' top two pass catchers -- wide receiver Charlie Jones and tight end Payne Durham\u00a0-- declaring for the NFL Draft, junior wide out TJ\u00a0Sheffield will look to take advantage of a bigger role on the offense. Sheffield had 39 receptions for 424 yards (10.9 average) and three touchdowns during the regular season. In the Big Ten title game against Michigan, he caught four passes for 54 yards (13.5 average).",
            "The Tigers forced a turnover on downs to open the second half as senior linebacker Micah Baskerville nearly intercepted Burton on 4th-and-4 from the Purdue 45. Nabers found Daniels for a 5-yard touchdown pass on a trick play. That marked Nabers\u2019 second passing completion of the game, giving him 50 yards through the air and a touchdown to extend the Tigers\u2019 lead to 42-0. With the receiving score, Daniels also became the only LSU quarterback with a passing and receiving touchdown in the same game since at least World War II. Brooks picked off Alaimo at the Purdue 27 with 9:17 remaining in the third quarter. Nabers added to an already impressive day by taking a jet sweep from Nussmeier 75 yards for a touchdown, extending the LSU lead to 49-0 with 3:15 left in the third quarter. On the second play from scrimmage in the fourth quarter, the Boilermakers got on the board as Alaimo found Sheffield for a 16-yard touchdown to make it 49-7 Tigers. True freshman Walker Howard entered at quarterback for LSU, leading the offense to a seven play scoring drive, culminating in a 12-yard touchdown rush up the middle by Derrick Davis Jr. to extend the lead to 56-7.",
            "He immediately started showcasing his arm talent, taking a shot deep to Malik Nabers on his first throw of the game. Like Daniels, he finished the drive with a touchdown. Nussmeier completed 4-of-6 passes on the drive for 39 yards, most notably finding Mason Taylor on third down for 17 yards to get LSU into the red zone. Nussmeier rotated out for Daniels on the next drive which also led to a touchdown. But that drive wasn't his last, as Nussmeier finished the game with 173 passing yards and two touchdowns. His only error came in the third quarter when he threw an interception in the end zone that snapped LSU's six-touchdown streak. But regardless of the result, Nussmeier's early insertion into the game poses an interesting wrinkle for LSU's quarterback's room heading into spring practices. Without three starters on the defensive line and with little to no depth at wide receiver and cornerback, LSU had to shake up its rotations with some new faces even before the game got out of hand in the fourth quarter. On the defensive line, edge rusher Zavier Carter was featured on a few passing downs in the first half while linebacker Mike Jones Jr., who has played limited snaps in the second half of the season, played more with BJ Ojulari opting out for the NFL Draft and Desmond Little in the transfer portal.",

Before going 7-6 in 2021, Oregon State had seven consecutive losing seasons. Now the Beavers are 17-9 over the past two seasons. And with Clemson transfer quarterback DJ Uiagalelei joining the program next season, the Beavers could be a trendy preseason pick to contend for the Pac-12 title. Florida State: The Seminoles have 10 wins in a season for the first time since 2016 after a 35-32 win over Oklahoma in the Cheez-It Bowl. Jordan Travis threw for 418 yards on 38 attempts while Johnny Wilson had eight catches for 202 yards. The Seminoles had 587 yards on 72 plays and won the game despite going 0-of-3 on fourth down attempts.

          "The 2022 Vrbo Citrus Bowl was a heck of a great game, with momentum swings and thrilling, crunch-time drives from either team.\u00a0 But that matters very little to the Hawkeyes and their fans, who will fly back to Iowa with a 20-17 loss to Mark Stoops and the SEC's Kentucky. The Hawkeyes had their destiny in their own hands, with the ball and a timeout, starting at their 25, down 20-17, with 1:48 left to win the game. And the drive started with promise. Iowa advanced to the Kentucky 40 with 48 seconds left. But then, Spencer Petras threw an errant pass into the diving arms of DeAndre Square at the Wildcats' 26. Game over. Here's how it happened. That was just a heck of a drive by Kentucky, highlighted by Wan'Dale Robinson's 52-yard catch-and-run to give him 17 catches for 170 yards so far today. Chris Rodriguez Jr. finished off the eight-play, 80-yard drive with a 6-yard rushing score. Now, can Iowa's much-maligned offense, which has performed considerably better in the second half than it did the first, win the game for this defense? Also: Tyler Linderbaum is back in the game. Iowa went three-and-out. It tried to draw Kentucky offside on a fourth-and-1 but it didn't work so Tory Taylor punted.",
          "The Aggies opened the season 1-5 before closing out the year by winning six of seven to finish 7-6. NMSU won a combined eight games in its previous four seasons, so Kill has executed an incredible turnaround in his first year on the job. Diego Pavia was the star of the bowl win. Pavia threw for 167 yards and two touchdowns and added 65 rushing yards in the win. He picked up several key third-down conversions with his legs in the second half to help his team secure the win. Southern Miss RB Frank Gore Jr.: Frank Gore Jr. ran wild in Southern Miss\u2019 win over Rice in the LendingTree Bowl. Gore set an all-time bowl record with 329 yards on just 21 carries in the 38-24 win. Gore rushed for two touchdowns and also had an 18-yard touchdown catch. The previous single-game bowl rushing record was 317 yards, but Gore surged past that with a 55-yard touchdown run in the final minutes. Southern Miss won a combined six games in 2020 and 2021, but the bowl win over Rice gave the Golden Eagles seven wins for the 2022 season. And with Gore and a significant chunk of this team\u2019s core expected to return, Southern Miss could be a team on the rise in the Sun Belt next season. Eastern Michigan: With a win over San Jose State in the Potato Bowl, EMU notched its first bowl victory since 1987.",
          "Western Kentucky: WKU may have had the most impressive performance of bowl season. The Hilltoppers trounced South Alabama 44-23 in the New Orleans Bowl in a game that was not as close as the final score may indicate. South Alabama was looking for its first-ever bowl win, but WKU jumped out to a 31-3 halftime lead and never looked back, putting up a total of 677 yards by the time the final seconds ticked off. Austin Reed threw for 497 yards and four touchdowns in the win. Air Force: Air Force looked right at home on an incredibly cold night in Fort Worth. The Falcons ran all over Baylor in a 30-15 victory in the Armed Forces Bowl. Air Force rushed for 276 yards and limited Baylor to just 42 rushing yards. With the win, Air Force got to double-digit victories for the third time in four seasons. AFA went 11-2 in 2019 and 10-3 in the past two seasons. In the shortened 2020 season, the Falcons finished 3-3. As a program, Air Force has won four consecutive bowl games. New Mexico State: Year 1 of the Jerry Kill era at New Mexico State ended with a bowl victory. NMSU knocked off Bowling Green 24-19 in the Quick Lane Bowl on Monday to capture the program\u2019s second bowl victory since 1960.",
          "The game was a punt hater\u2019s dream. And it was a nightmare for Ole Miss QB Jaxson Dart. He threw three interceptions and fumbled once. Texas Tech QB Tyler Shough rushed for two TDs and threw for another as the Red Raiders easily held on to a 19-point halftime lead throughout the second half. The loss also meant that Ole Miss ends the season at 8-5 after starting the season 7-0. Oklahoma: The Sooners entered the Cheez-It Bowl shorthanded and as significant underdogs to Florida State. Losing 35-32 was still a cover for Oklahoma. But the loss also means that Oklahoma finishes the season at 6-7. That\u2019s the first losing season for OU since 1998. The first year of the Brent Venables era was a bit rocky \u2014 especially when you consider the success that Caleb Williams and Lincoln Riley had at USC. But there\u2019s no reason to panic in Norman. Yet. SMU: The Mustangs entered the New Mexico Bowl as 4.5-point favorites over a BYU team that started freshman third-string QB Sol-Jay Maiava-Peters for the first time. Yet BYU did just enough on the ground to eke out a 24-23 win after stopping an SMU two-point conversion with eight seconds left.",
          "Head coach Kirk Ferentz has kept things close to the vest with his signal-callers, but it's looking like Petras, who started the season as the starter and ended the season as the starter, will get the nod. Star running back Tyler Goodson opted out of the Citrus Bowl for the Hawkeyes as he prepares for the NFL Draft. Freshman receiver Keagan Johnson has also been ruled out for the Citrus Bowl.",
          "Georgia Southern: The Camellia Bowl was a painful watch if you were an Eagles fan. Buffalo beat Georgia Southern 23-21 after going 12-of-19 on third down while averaging less than three yards a carry. In addition to being unable to consistently stop Buffalo on third down, Georgia Southern players dropped multiple catchable passes. Kyle Vantrease threw for 352 yards on 45 attempts and hit Joshua Thompson on a 79-yard TD. But Georgia Southern never got the ball back after pulling within two with 3:38 to go because of two crucial third down conversions by the Bulls to run out the clock. Oklahoma State: The Cowboys entered the Guaranteed Rate Bowl as underdogs to Wisconsin, so OSU\u2019s 24-17 loss to the Badgers wasn\u2019t terribly surprising. But it\u2019s still worth noting just how poorly OSU finished the season. The Cowboys started the season 6-1 and finished 7-6 after ending the season on a 1-5 run. Yeah, Oklahoma State played the final two games of the season without QB Spencer Sanders, but the biggest culprit for the collapse was the regression of the defense in 2022. A testy Mike Gundy didn\u2019t want to talk about any potential staff changes after the game and we\u2019re not going to be surprised if there are some staff announcements forthcoming from OSU in the near future.",
          "Iowa QBs combined to throw for seven TDs all season while the defense itself scored six touchdowns. UCLA: UCLA had a meltdown in the Sun Bowl, blowing a 14-point lead in a loss to Pitt. The Bruins led 28-14 midway through the third quarter but allowed Pitt to come back and win 37-35 with a field goal in the final seconds. In his final college game, Dorian Thompson-Robinson threw three costly interceptions. Two came deep in Pitt territory and the third came deep in his own territory, giving the Panthers a short field to tie the game at 28-28 early in the fourth. To make matters worse, UCLA fumbled the ensuing kickoff to allow Pitt to take the lead. Later in the fourth, UCLA scored with 34 seconds to go to take a 35-34 lead. It looked like it would be the game-winner, but the defense allowed Pitt to go 46 yards in 30 seconds and kick the game-winning field goal. Brutal. UCLA has not won a bowl game since the 2014 season. Ole Miss: The Rebels had 11 drives that didn\u2019t end in points in a 42-25 loss to Texas Tech in the Texas Bowl. Ole Miss turned the ball over five times, gave up the ball five times on downs and punted once. While the Rebels were just 2-of-7 on fourth downs, Texas Tech was 5-of-6.",

But nothing effective, either. Well, that was not very difficult. After Iowa's empty possession to start the day, Kentucky responded with a methodical 13-play, 80-yard scoring drive that ate up 7:28 of clock. Quarterback Will Levis capped it with a 5-yard touchdown pass to running back Chris Rodriguez Jr. The Wildcats converted on two third downs\u00a0\u2014 a third-and-3 at their 42 (they got a 5-yard run) and a third-and-4 at Iowa's 29 (they got a 14-yard completion). Nothing doing on the Hawkeyes' first possession. Spencer Petras started with a 12-yard completion to Sam LaPorta on the game's first play, but Iowa went three-and-out from there. Kentucky will take over at its 20 after Tory Taylor's punt went into the end zone. Spencer Petras was on the field for the first snap. Start question, answered. Looking for some pregame reading? Here's Register columnist Chad Leistikow with his prediction for the Citrus Bowl. There was a lot of talk about whether it'd\u00a0be Spencer Petras or Alex Padilla behind center for the Hawkeyes today.",
          "The freshman Maiava-Peters threw for just 47 yards and an interception but rushed 14 times for 96 yards while Christopher Brooks rushed 19 times for 88 yards. SMU didn\u2019t have receiver Rashee Rice but still had just 218 yards passing on 37 pass attempts. UTSA: The Roadrunners are still searching for their first bowl win after losing 18-12 to Troy in the Cure Bowl. It was an absolutely ugly performance from UTSA too. Without offensive coordinator Will Stein (now the OC at Oregon), the proficient UTSA offense committed five turnovers. The Roadrunners also had nine penalties for 104 yards and many of those penalties came at critical times. A win over the Trojans would have been a big boost to a UTSA team making a step up to the AAC in 2023. NC State: Dave Doeren's risk-averse decision-making may have cost his team a bowl win. NC State lost the Duke's Mayo Bowl 16-12. In the loss, Doeren decided to kick field goals twice inside the Maryland 10-yard line. In the first half, Doeren kicked on fourth-and-goal from the 2. And when his team trailed 13-9 midway through the fourth, Doeren sent his kicker out instead of going for it on fourth-and-3 from the 9.",
          "It\u2019s been a long time coming. Before Chris Creighton arrived as head coach in 2014, the 1987 California Bowl was the program\u2019s last bowl trip. Since then, Creighton brought the Eagles to five bowl games, but this year was the first time EMU pulled out the victory. With the win, EMU finished 9-4 for the season. That\u2019s the second-most wins in a season in program history. Kentucky: The Wildcats made sure that the Music City Bowl was going to hit the under in a 21-0 loss to Iowa. The total for the game was 31 and the lowest total for a bowl game in decades. It was also the lowest total of any game this season after Iowa and Minnesota had a pregame total of 31.5 in what turned out to be a 13-10 game. And just like that Iowa win, this game went under too. The two teams combined for fewer than 400 total yards and punted the ball 18 times with just 21 first downs between them. It was as ugly as an offensive performance as we all expected, especially from Kentucky. Freshman QB Destin Wade started in place of Will Levis and threw two pick sixes in the second quarter. The loss drops the Wildcats to 7-6 in what ultimately is a disappointing season while Iowa finishes at 8-5 despite its remarkable offensive futility throughout the season.",
          "The NC State offense struggled mightily all day, and that ended up being the final scoring opportunity of the game for NC State. San Diego State: The Aztecs turned the ball over five times in a 25-23 loss to Middle Tennessee in the Hawaii Bowl. The Blue Raiders had just 170 yards in the win and threw for 236 yards. Yes, you read that correctly. Thanks to sacks, MTSU had a remarkable -66 rushing yards on 30 attempts. And still won the game. SDSU QB Jalen Mayden threw three interceptions and also had a fumble. The Aztecs\u2019 final turnover came with 55 seconds to go on a 4th and 24 when Tyrell Shavers fumbled the ball after a 12-yard gain. Cincinnati: It was a listless performance for the Bearcats in a 24-7 loss to Louisville in the Fenway Bowl. Cincinnati had just 127 yards of total offense and allowed 419 yards to the Cardinals. Cincy got just 10 first downs and rushed for 44 yards on 38 attempts after sacks were factored in. Louisville even turned the ball over four times to Cincinnati\u2019s two and the game still wasn\u2019t close. If you didn\u2019t know any better, you would have assumed that Scott Satterfield had gone to a far worse team when he left Louisville for Cincy before the bowl game.",
          "He threw for 224 yards and ran for 73 more, including a gutsy 11-yard scramble that set up the game-winning field goal. UCLA took a 35-34 lead with 34 seconds remaining, but Patti quickly led the Panthers into field goal range, allowing Ben Sauls to boot his fourth field goal of the game. This one, a 47-yarder, was the game-winner. Pitt coach Pat Narduzzi has already indicated that Patti won't be back next season. So if that was Patti's final college game, he went out with a bang. Fresno State: After a 1-4 start, Fresno State closed out the season with nine consecutive wins. After beating Boise State in the Mountain West title game, the Bulldogs cruised past Washington State 29-6 in the LA Bowl to get to 10 wins for the fourth time in the last six seasons. In the process, Fresno State became the first team in FBS history to get to 10 wins after losing four of five to start the season. The LA Bowl was the final college game for Jake Haener and he went out in style. Haener threw for 280 yards and two touchdowns while Jordan Mims rushed out for 209 yards and had two scores of his own. Duke: Duke went from winless in ACC play in 2021 to nine wins in 2022.",

With the win, Duke got to nine wins for the first time since 2014. Mike Elko has done one of the best coaching jobs in the country in his first season with the Blue Devils. The program was barely competitive in David Cutcliffe\u2019s final seasons on the job, going a combined 5-18 (1-17 ACC) in his final two years. With Wednesday\u2019s win, Duke finished the season 9-4 overall with a 5-3 mark in ACC play. It was just the third season in school history that the Blue Devils had finished with a winning conference record and won a bowl game. Washington: After going 4-8 in 2021, Washington capped off a tremendous turnaround by beating Texas 27-20 in the Alamo Bowl. With the win, Washington finished the season with 11 wins \u2014 the most it has had in a season since 2016. That's the year the Huskies reached the College Football Playoff. After coming over from Fresno State, head coach Kalen DeBoer was able to revitalize the program in just one season. The addition of quarterback Michael Penix Jr. played a big role. Penix, who will return next season, threw for 287 yards and two touchdowns in the bowl win.",

          "After a disastrous first play that saw Kentucky log a 10-yard run and get an extra 10 yards to Iowa's 11, the Hawkeye defense shored up and forced the Wildcats to settle for another field goal after they intercepted Patras at the 31. Spencer Petras' second-and-11 pass was tipped at the line of scrimmage and intercepted, and Kentucky will take over at Iowa's\u00a031-yard line. Oh dear ... that was painful for Hawkeye fans. Zach VanValkenburg and Joe Evans secured back-to-back sacks to force Kentucky into a third-and-26 from its 46-yard line. Then ... Will Levis connected with Wan'Dale Robinson for a 34-yard completion down the middle, right in the hole of Iowa's defense. The Hawkeyes were able to force the Wildcats into a 21-yard field goal, so that was a win. But still, not getting off the field on a third-and-24 is rough. It was another long, methodical drive\u00a0\u2014 14 plays, 72 yards, 8:15 of time. My goodness, it's hot down there. On-field temperatures are well above 100 degrees in Orlando, Florida, at Camping World Stadium for the Citrus Bowl. Not quite the 10-degree winter weather we're getting here in Iowa, eh? Iowa's offense showed some good things on a scoring drive that led to a 28-yard field goal from Caleb Shudak.",
          "The the offense responded with its best drive of the day, featuring a gorgeous 34-yard completion from Spencer Petras to Sam LaPorta and 27 hard-earned yards from Gavin Williams on three carries. But on a fourth-and-inches at Kentucky's 11, the Hawkeyes were aggressive and wanted the touchdown ... but Petras and Tyler Linderbaum couldn't connect on the snap and Petras fell on the ball behind the line of scrimmage. Seven plays, 69 yards ... no points. This stat from Register columnist Chad Leistikow is damning. The Hawkeyes were able to gain a few chunks of yards, to get close enough for a last-second Hail Mary from Spencer Petras. It was intercepted. To halftime we go, and the Wildcats start the second half with the ball. Petras went 10-for-16 for 82 yards and two interceptions. Gavin Williams led the backfield with five carries for 25 yards. This half has been pretty much all Kentucky, with the Wildcats out-possessing Iowa 19:22 to 10:38. They're also 4-for-7 on third-down attempts, while Iowa is 0-for-4. Another save from the Hawkeye defense.",

It worked to perfection for a 36-yard touchdown pass. What a drive\u00a0\u2014 nine plays, 92 yards, 3:15 of clock. Iowa has looked like an entirely different team in this second half. Big plays from Jack Campbell spearheaded Iowa's defensive effort to stall Kentucky near midfield, and now the Hawkeyes take over at their 8-yard line, down 13-10. And Gavin Williams starts the drive with a 19-yard run. Can you say momentum swing? We've got ourselves a game, folks. Good things usually happen when Arland Bruce IV, who was an All-Iowa Elite Team running back in his senior season at Ankeny, gets the ball in the backfield. The true freshman capped a six-play, 50-yard drive with a 20-yard rushing score on a jet sweep, a play that's traditionally been kind to the Hawkeyes. LeShon Williams also logged two carries for 20 yards on that drive. Iowa already has 119 total yards in the second half, which nearly matches their whole first-half total. Iowa's defense came out of the half well and forced a Kentucky punt.",

        "response_no_docs": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out where the Super Bowl 2021 was held. Let me start by recalling what I know about the Super Bowl. The Super Bowl is the championship game of the National Football League (NFL) in the United States. Each year, it's held at a different stadium, usually in a large city. The event is a major sporting event and is also known for its elaborate halftime show and commercials.\n\nNow, for the year 2021, I need to remember if there's any specific stadium or city that hosted it. I think the Super Bowl is usually in February, so Super Bowl 2021 would have been in February 2021. Let me try to remember if there was any recent Super Bowls in cities like Miami, Los Angeles, or maybe somewhere else. Wait, I think the 2020 Super Bowl was in Miami, but I'm not sure. Let me check my memory. Super Bowl LIV was in 2020, held at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida. Then Super Bowl LV would be in 2021. \n\nWait, but sometimes the NFL rotates the host cities. I think the 2021 Super Bowl was in Tampa. Let me think. Tampa has a stadium called Raymond James Stadium. I remember that the Tampa Bay Buccaneers were the host team for the Super Bowl in 2021 because they were the NFC champions. Wait, no, the host city isn't necessarily the team's home stadium unless they are the host. But the host city is selected by the NFL. \n\nWait, I think the 2021 Super Bowl was in Tampa, Florida. The teams that played were the Kansas City Chiefs and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Buccaneers won that game. So if the game was in Tampa, then the location would be Raymond James Stadium in Tampa. Let me confirm. The Super Bowl in 2021 was the 55th edition, so Super Bowl LV. The date was February 7, 2021. The host city was Tampa, Florida. The stadium is Raymond James Stadium. \n\nI think that's correct. Let me see if there's any conflicting information. I don't recall any other cities being mentioned for that year. The NFL usually announces the host cities several years in advance. For example, Super Bowl 2021 was hosted in Tampa, and then Super Bowl 20",
        "response_with_wrong_docs": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question about the Super Bowl 2021 location. The user provided three documents, so I need to check each one carefully.\n\nFirst, Document 1 says the game was played on February 7, 2021, at Raymond James Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. It mentions that's the Buccaneers' home stadium. Wait, I thought Raymond James Stadium is actually in Tampa, Florida. Glendale is in Arizona, so maybe there's a mistake here. But the document says Glendale, Arizona. Hmm.\n\nDocument 2 states that the NFL voted to move Super Bowl LV (which is 2021) from Los Angeles to Glendale, Arizona. That seems to confirm the location as Glendale. But again, I'm a bit confused because I remember the Buccaneers are from Tampa, not Arizona. Maybe the stadium was temporarily used there?\n\nDocument 3 also mentions Super Bowl 2021 at Raymond James Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. But wait, Raymond James Stadium is actually in Tampa. Glendale, Arizona has State Farm Stadium, which hosted the Super Bowl in 2015 and 2023. So there's a mix-up here between the stadium names and locations. The documents say Glendale, Arizona, but the correct stadium there is State Farm Stadium, not Raymond James. The Buccaneers' home is in Tampa, so maybe the documents have errors.\n\nPutting this together, the documents all point to Glendale, Arizona as the location, but there's a factual error in the stadium name. The correct stadium in Glendale is State Farm Stadium. However, the user's documents mention Raymond James Stadium in Glendale, which is incorrect. So the answer should be Glendale, Arizona, but the documents have an error in the stadium name. Since the question is about the location, the city is correct as Glendale, Arizona, even though the stadium name is wrong. The user's documents might have mixed up the stadium names and locations. Therefore, the answer is Glendale, Arizona, but there's a factual error in the documents regarding the stadium's name.\n</think>\n\nThere are factual errors in the provided documents. The correct location for Super Bowl 2021 (Super Bowl LV) was **State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona**. The documents incorrectly refer to \"Raymond James Stadium,\" which is actually located in Tampa, Florida (home of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers). The NFL moved the Super Bowl from Los",

I think they were in PyeongChang, South Korea. That was in February 2018, right?\n\nNow, the question is about the total number of medals. The user is asking which country had the highest number of medals. I remember that the United States usually does well in the Winter Olympics, but so do countries like Norway, Russia, and Canada. Wait, but in 2018, Russia was banned from the Olympics due to a state-sponsored doping scandal. So instead of Russia, athletes from Russia competed under the name \"Olympic Athletes from Russia\" (OAR). So maybe OAR still did well?\n\nLet me try to remember the medal count. Norway often does really well in the Winter Olympics. I think they had a lot of gold medals. For example, in the 2018 games, Norway might have been the top in total medals. Let me think. The 2018 Winter Olympics had 92 events, so the country with the most medals would have a significant number. \n\nI recall that Norway won 39 medals in total, which was the highest. The United States came in second with 34 medals, and Germany was third with 31. Russia (OAR) was fourth with 29. Canada was fifth with 29 as well. So Norway was the leader in total medals. But wait, I should check if that's correct. Let me try to recall the exact numbers. Norway had 14 gold, 14 silver, and 11 bronze. That adds up to 39. The US had 12 gold, 10 silver, and 12 bronze, totaling 34. Germany had 14 gold, 10 silver, and 7 bronze, totaling 31. So yes, Norway was first in total medals. \n\nBut wait, sometimes the ranking is based on gold medals first, then silver, then bronze. If that's the case, maybe another country would be first. However, the question specifically asks for the most medals, not the most gold medals. So total number of medals. In that case, Norway was first with 39. So the answer should be Norway. Let me confirm once more.",
        "response_with_wrong_docs": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking which country won the most medals at the 2018 Winter Olympics. I need to check the provided documents to find the answer.\n\nLooking at Document 1: It says the U.S. set a record with 39 medals, surpassing their previous record of 37 in 2010. But wait, the 2018 Olympics are in question here. So if Document 1 is talking about 2018, then the U.S. would have 39 there. But the document mentions \"at a single Winter Olympics,\" so maybe that's the 2018 count.\n\nDocument 2 mentions that the U.S. came out on top with the most medals and tied with Germany. Wait, if they tied, then both would have the same number. But Document 1 says the U.S. surpassed others. Hmm, maybe there's a discrepancy here. Let me check Document 3. It states that after 19 days of competition in 2018, the U.S. was on top of the medal count. So that supports the U.S. leading. Document 4 says the U.S. collected 39 medals in 2018, the largest haul. So Document 4 confirms the 39 medals for the U.S. in 2018.\n\nBut Document 2 says they tied with Germany. Wait, maybe there's a mistake here. Let me cross-reference. If Document 4 says the U.S. had 39, which is the largest, but Document 2 says they tied with Germany. Maybe the actual numbers were U.S. with 39 and Germany with 39 as well? But Document 1 says the U.S. surpassed their own previous record. However, if they tied with Germany, then both would have the same number. But Document 4 says \"the largest haul by any country,\" implying they were first. Maybe the other countries had fewer. So perhaps the U.S. had 39, Germany also had 39, but the U.S. was on top? Or maybe the tie was in a different category. Wait, Document 2 says \"tied with Germany for...\" but the rest is cut off. Maybe the original text says they tied for the most medals, but the U.S. ended up on top. Maybe there's a mistake in Document 2. Let me think.",
