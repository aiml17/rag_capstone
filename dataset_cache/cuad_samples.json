The Parties agree that prior to July 1, 2000, iVillage will provide FMM with the opportunity to renew this Agreement (the \"Renewal Term\") on terms set forth in a proposal (the \"Proposal) to be presented to FMM. FMM shall indicate its acceptance or rejection of the Proposal no later than August 31, 2000.

In the event of a material breach by either Party of any term of this Agreement, the non-breaching Party may terminate this Agreement by written notice to the breaching Party if the breaching Party fails to cure such material breach within thirty (30) days of receipt of written notice thereof. In addition, either Party may terminate this Agreement effective upon written notice stating its intention to terminate in the event the other Party (i) ceases to function as a going concern or to conduct operations in the normal course of business, or (ii) has a petition filed by or against it under any state or federal bankruptcy or insolvency law which petition has not been dismissed or set aside within sixty (60) days of its filing.

Subject to reasonable written notice to iVillage, FMM may          request a reasonable reallocation of impressions as determined by FMM.          The advertising units of Ford Division and other Ford Motor Company          entities shall be served by a third party advertisement server, which          shall be compliant with Net gravity, or Doubleclick or other compatible          technology.\n\n                  (ii) During the Promotion Period, iVillage traffic shall be          audited by a third party traffic auditor listed on Exhibit A and          iVillage shall provide FMM with relevant reports on a biweekly basis.          iVillage will provide ongoing marketing, creative, technical and          editorial consultation to FMM.\n\n                  (iii) In the event that iVillage fails to deliver the          advertising impressions during the Promotion Period, FMM shall have the          option of either (a) extending the Initial Term of this Agreement for          an additional three (3) month period to \"make good\" the undelivered          impressions or (b) requiring iVillage to refund to FMM an amount equal          to [*] for each [*] impressions which were not delivered.\n\n                  (iv) However, if iVillage falls to deliver the advertising          impressions during the Promotion Period and FMM desires that iVillage          \"make good\" the undelivered impressions and extend the Initial Term          pursuant to option (a) set forth in Section 2.C.(iii), if the Parties          have decided not to renew the Initial Term and iVillage desires to          enter into an agreement with an entity whose business(es) would pose a          conflict to FMM                                         2\n\n         or Ford Motor Credit, then iVillage, at iVillage's option, may refund          the remaining impression deficiency to FMM, and immediately upon          pavement of such, the \"make good\" obligation shall terminate.\n\n         D. During the Initial Term, iVillage will design and administer, (i) a minimum of [*] online conferences which shall include live chats and the archiving of conference transcripts (dates of such conferences shall be determined by FMM and shall occur approximately once every two months, but not earlier than March 1, 1999 and FMM shall provide iVillage with not less than forty five (45) days advance notice of any conference); (ii) a minimum of [*] online polls; (iii) a minimum of [*] sixty-second surveys; (iv) a minimum of [*] online focus groups; and (v) a minimum of [*] customized turn-key Network sweepstakes (iVillage shall be responsible for all aspects of the sweepstakes other than the prize(s) which shall be provided by Ford Motor Company (\"FMC\")).

During the Initial Term, iVillage will develop and administer [*] message boards pertaining to topics mutually determined by the Parties.

FMC shall have prior approval over all iVillage uses of any, Ford Mark, as defined below. In the event that any of the Ford-branded links and/or mentions set forth in this Section 2.F. are, in FMC's reasonable judgment, materially injurious to FMC.

Once presented with an opportunity, Hertz shall have five (5) business days in which to accept or reject such terms. If iVillage does not receive Hertz's acceptance or rejection of such within the allotted time, iVillage shall deem Hertz's silence as rejection. The terms of any such relationship shall be mutually determined by the Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, FMC shall, on a non-exclusive basis,\n\n                                       3\n\nbe permitted to offer Ford Motor Credit car financing products related to the purchase of Ford vehicles.\n\n5.

During the Promotional Period, iVillage will place special Ford-branded text links, newsletter mentions, hotlinks and taglines throughout the Network. FMC shall have prior approval over all iVillage uses of any, Ford Mark, as defined below. In the event that any of the Ford-branded links and/or mentions set forth in this Section 2.F. are, in FMC's reasonable judgment, materially injurious to FMC.

Once presented with an opportunity, Hertz shall have five (5) business days in which to accept or reject such terms. If iVillage does not receive Hertz's acceptance or rejection of such within the allotted time, iVillage shall deem Hertz's silence as rejection. The terms of any such relationship shall be mutually determined by the Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, FMC shall, on a non-exclusive basis,\n\n                                       3\n\nbe permitted to offer Ford Motor Credit car financing products related to the purchase of Ford vehicles.\n\n5.

Specifically, Section 2(d) details the royalty payments to be made by THI to Marv based on the Fair Market Value of Licensed Products sold, leased, or put into use, as well as services that use the Licensed Products. However, there is no mention of a minimum royalty or minimum purchase obligation.\n\nThe agreement is focused on the licensing of intellectual property and the joint development of COVID-19 treatments, without imposing any minimum purchase requirements between the parties.",

With respect to the Remarketing Agent's responsibilities, but without affecting the Calculation and Paying Agent's role as intermediary (if applicable), the Remarketing Agent hereby agrees that, if the Remarketing Agent obtains a bid at the Purchase Price for any VRRM-MFP Shares being remarketed, which, if accepted, would be binding on the bidder for the consummation of the sale of such VRRM-MFP Shares (an \"actionable bid\"), and the Remarketing Agent elects in its sole discretion to accept such actionable bid, the Remarketing Agent shall (i) purchase the Tendered VRRM-MFP Shares, as a principal and not as an agent, from the Beneficial Owner or Holder thereof on the Purchase Date at the Purchase Price, (ii) resell such VRRM-MFP Shares, as a principal and not as an agent, to the Person making such actionable bid at the Purchase Price, and (iii) record such purchase and resale on its books and records in accordance with this provision.

Except as otherwise expressly provided for herein, the purchase and delivery of Tendered VRRM-MFP Shares and the remarketing thereof, and payments with respect to the foregoing, will be accomplished in accordance with the applicable procedures of the Securities Depository.\n\n(h) Return of Unsold VRRM-MFP Shares. Any VRRM-MFP Shares unsold in a remarketing will be returned to the relevant tendering Beneficial Owners or their Agent Members, or the relevant tendering Holders, as the case may be, by the Remarketing Agent; provided that such tender will continue until the earlier of the occurrence of a successful remarketing or the Failed Remarketing Mandatory Redemption Date.\n\n(i) Timing Requirements. The Remarketing Agent agrees to the remarketing timing requirements applicable to it in the Supplement. The Remarketing Agent may, in its sole discretion, modify the settlement procedures set forth therein with respect to any Remarketing upon ten (10) days' prior written notice to the Fund and the Calculation and Paying Agent, provided any such modification does not adversely affect the Holders, the Beneficial Owners, the Calculation and Paying Agent or the Fund.\n\n(j) Purchases by Remarketing Agent. If the Remarketing Agent in its sole discretion decides to purchase unsold VRRM- MFP Shares for its own account, on each Purchase Date, the Remarketing Agent will settle such purchase through delivery against payment of the Purchase Price for such VRRM-MFP Shares to be received by the Remarketing Agent by 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on such Purchase Date.

Whenever the Fund intends or expects to include any Taxable Allocation in any dividend on VRRM-MFP Shares, the Fund shall provide a Notice of Taxable Allocation in accordance with Section 2.7(a) of the Supplement. Whenever such advance notice is received from the Fund, the Calculation and Paying Agent will notify each Holder and the Remarketing Agent. The Remarketing Agent shall promptly notify each potential Beneficial Owner or its Agent Member after receipt of such advance notice by the Remarketing Agent.\n\nSection 3. Representations, Warranties and Covenants of the Remarketing Agent and the Fund.\n\n(a) The Remarketing Agent hereby represents, warrants and agrees that it has, and during the term of this Agreement shall maintain, all licenses, consents and other rights required for the use of any index or other data in connection with calculation of the Dividend Rate or dissemination thereof.\n\n(b) The Fund represents and warrants to, and agrees with, the Remarketing Agent as as of each Purchase Date, Remarketing Date or New Mode Commencement Date, as applicable (each, a \"Representation Date\"), that (i) the Fund has made all the filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"Commission\") that are required to be made under the 1940 Act and the 1940 Act Regulations (collectively, the \"1940 Act Documents\"), (ii) each 1940 Act Document complies in all material respects with the requirements of the 1940 Act and the 1940 Act Regulations, and each 1940 Act Document did not at the time of filing with the Commission include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and (iii) the applicable Remarketing Materials, as amended or supplemented, including by any subsequently filed 1940 Act Document on or prior to such Representation Date (or, if applicable, by any document filed pursuant to the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act Regulations), as provided by the Fund, will not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided, however, that the Fund makes no representations or warranties with respect to information provided by the Remarketing Agent specifically for use in the Remarketing Materials.\n\n(c) The financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the 1940 Act Documents, together with the related notes and schedules, present fairly the financial position of the Fund as of the dates indicated and the results of operations, cash flows and changes in shareholders' equity of the Fund for the periods specified and have been prepared in compliance with the requirements of the 1940 Act and the 1940 Act Regulations and in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved; the other financial and statistical data contained or incorporated by reference in the 1940 Act Documents are accurately and fairly presented and prepared on a basis consistent with the financial statements and books and records of the Fund.\n\n(d) The Fund agrees (i) to deliver to the Remarketing Agent, within fifteen (15) calendar days following the last day of each calendar month beginning with [●], a report of 6\n\n\n\n\n\nportfolio holdings of the Fund as of the close of business as of the last Business Day of such calendar month, listing portfolio holdings of the Fund by CUSIP and principal amount, and (ii) that, on or after such fifteenth calendar day (or earlier, with the Fund's prior approval) the Remarketing Agent may provide such report and/or the information therein to investors in the VRRM- MFP Shares, upon the investor's request.\n\nSection 4. Fees and Expenses. For the performance of its services as Remarketing Agent hereunder, the Fund shall pay to the Remarketing Agent in arrears on the first day of each calendar month (or, if such day is not a Business Day, on the next succeeding Business Day) a monthly fee for each MFP Share Outstanding on the first calendar day of the preceding calendar month (or the date hereof in the case of the first such payment), in an amount, rounded upward to the nearest dollar, equal to (a) the product of (i) the rate of compensation as then in effect, as shall be agreed upon from time to time in writing by the Fund and the Remarketing Agent, times $[●] multiplied by (ii) the actual number of days from and including such first calendar day of the preceding calendar month (or the date hereof in the case of the first such payment) to and including the last calendar day of such preceding calendar month or, if applicable, the date of termination of this Agreement, if earlier, or the date of any prior redemption or liquidation for such share (as the case may be), divided by (b) 360. The obligation of the Fund to make the payments required by this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement and remain in full force and effect until all such payments shall have been made in full.\n\nSection 5. Resignation, Suspension and Removal of the Remarketing Agent.\n\n(a) The Remarketing Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder with respect to the VRRM-MFP Shares by giving 90 days' prior written notice to the Fund and the Calculation and Paying Agent.\n\n(b) The Fund may remove the Remarketing Agent with respect to the VRRM-MFP Shares by giving at least 60 days' prior written notice to the Remarketing Agent (and will provide prior notice also to the Calculation and Paying Agent, if any); provided, however, that no such removal shall become effective for an additional 30 days unless the Fund shall have appointed at least one nationally recognized securities dealer with expertise in remarketing variable rate securities as a successor Remarketing Agent for the VRRM-MFP Shares and the successor Remarketing Agent shall have entered into a remarketing agreement with the Fund, in form and substance satisfactory to the Fund, in which it shall have agreed to, among other duties, conduct remarketings in respect of VRRM-MFP Shares and determine the Dividend Rate on each Business Day for the VRRM-MFP Shares in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Supplement.\n\nIn each of the occurrences described in clause (a) or (b), the Fund shall use its best efforts to appoint a successor Remarketing Agent for such VRRM-MFP Shares and enter into a remarketing agreement with such Person as soon as reasonably practicable.\n\nSection 6. Dealing in the VRRM-MFP Shares. The Remarketing Agent in its sole discretion may purchase for its own account VRRM-MFP Shares in a remarketing; however, subject to the last two sentences in Section 2(c) above, the Remarketing Agent shall not be obligated to purchase any VRRM-MFP Shares that would otherwise remain unsold in a 7\n\n\n\n\n\nremarketing. None of the Fund, the Calculation and Paying Agent nor the Remarketing Agent (subject to the last sentence in Section 2(c) above) shall be obligated in any case to provide funds to make payment to a Beneficial Owner or its Agent Member or a Holder upon such Beneficial Owner's or Holder's tender of its VRRM-MFP Shares in a remarketing unless, in each case, such VRRM-MFP Shares were acquired for the account of the Fund, the Calculation and Paying Agent or the Remarketing Agent, as applicable. The Remarketing Agent may exercise any vote or join in any action which any Holder of VRRM-MFP Shares may be entitled to exercise or take pursuant to the Statement with like effect as if it did not act in any capacity hereunder. The Remarketing Agent, in its individual capacity, either as principal or agent, may also engage in or have an interest in any financial or other transaction with the Fund as freely as if it did not act in any capacity hereunder.\n\nSection 7. Information.\n\n(a) The Fund agrees to furnish to the Remarketing Agent: (i) copies of the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Statement, the Supplement and its bylaws and any amendment thereto and each report or other document mailed or made available to Holders (including annual reports to shareholders) or filed by the Fund with the Commission (including any documents incorporated therein by reference) as the Remarketing Agent may reasonably request from time to time; (ii) notice of the creation of any subsidiary by the Fund; (iii) notice of the purchase of VRRM-MFP Shares by a subsidiary or affiliate of the Fund as soon as the Fund shall become aware of such purchase; (iv) notice of any change (including being put on Credit Watch or Watchlist), suspension or termination in or of the ratings on the VRRM-MFP Shares by any NRSRO then rating the VRRM-MFP Shares or any change of an NRSRO rating the VRRM-MFP Shares as promptly as practicable upon the occurrence thereof or the occurrence of any of the events set forth in clause (b)(i) or (b)(ii) of Section 8 hereof (with the occurrence of any of the events described in clause (b)(ii) to be determined without regard to the opinion of the Remarketing Agent referred to therein); and (v) in connection with a remarketing, a Remarketing Memorandum, and such other remarketing information, as the Remarketing Agent may reasonably request from time to time, including but not limited to the financial condition of the Fund. The Fund agrees to provide the Remarketing Agent with as many copies of the foregoing materials and information as the Remarketing Agent may reasonably request for use in connection with a remarketing or Transition Remarketing, as the case may be, of VRRM-MFP Shares and consents to the use thereof for such purpose.\n\n(b) If at any time during the term of this Agreement any event or condition known to the Fund relating to or affecting the Fund or the VRRM-MFP Shares shall occur which might affect the accuracy or completeness of any statement of a material fact contained in any of the reports, documents, materials and information referred to in clause (a)(v) above or any document incorporated therein by reference (collectively, the \"Remarketing Materials\") or any other materials or information made publicly available by the Fund, the Fund shall promptly notify the Remarketing Agent in writing of the circumstances and details of such event or condition and the Fund shall promptly prepare or cause to be prepared and delivered to the Remarketing Agent, at the Fund's expense, a supplement or amendment to the Remarketing Materials describing the circumstances and details of such event or condition. 8\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 8. Conditions to Obligations of the Remarketing Agent. The obligations of the Remarketing Agent with respect to VRRM-MFP Shares under this Agreement have been undertaken in reliance on, and shall be subject to: (a) the due performance in all material respects by the Fund of its obligations and agreements as set forth in this Agreement (including Sections 3(c) and 7(b) hereof); and (b) the non-occurrence of any of the following events: (i) all of the VRRM-MFP Shares shall have been redeemed by the Fund; (ii) without the prior written consent of the Remarketing Agent, the Supplement, the Statement, the Declaration, the by-laws of the Fund, or the Tender and Paying Agent Agreement shall either not be in full force and effect or have been amended in any manner that in the reasonable opinion of the Remarketing Agent materially changes the nature of the VRRM- MFP Shares or the remarketing procedures; (iii) legislation, or a decision by a court of the United States shall be rendered, or a stop order, ruling, regulation or official statement by, or on behalf of, the Commission or other governmental agency having jurisdiction of the subject matter shall be made, to the effect that the offering or sale of the VRRM-MFP Shares is or would be in violation of any provision of the 1933 Act as then in effect, or the 1934 Act as then in effect, or with the purpose or effect of otherwise prohibiting the offering or sale of the VRRM-MFP Shares, as contemplated hereby, without registration under the 1933 Act; (iv) any legislation, resolution, ordinance, rule or regulation shall be enacted by, any governmental body, department or agency of the United States or the State of New York, or a decision by any court of competent jurisdiction within the United States or the State of New York shall be rendered, which, in the Remarketing Agent's reasonable opinion, materially adversely affects the marketability of the VRRM-MFP Shares; (v) additional material restrictions not in force as of the date hereof shall have been imposed upon trading in securities generally by any governmental authority or by any national securities exchange, which, in the Remarketing Agent's reasonable opinion, would cause the performance of the Remarketing Agent's obligations hereunder to violate applicable law; (vi) any litigation shall be instituted and be outstanding, to restrain or enjoin the sale or remarketing of the VRRM-MFP Shares or in any way protesting or affecting any authority of the Fund with respect to the validity of the VRRM- MFP Shares or this Agreement, or the existence or powers of the Fund to perform its obligations hereunder; (vii) a general banking moratorium has been declared by federal or New York authorities having jurisdiction, a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services or a force majeure event shall have occurred which in the reasonable opinion of the Remarketing Agent materially adversely affects the settlement or clearance of the VRRM-MFP Shares; or (viii) a material misstatement or omission in the Remarketing Materials has occurred, so that it is not advisable, in the reasonable judgment of the Remarketing Agent, to attempt to remarket the VRRM-MFP Shares, provided that the Remarketing Agent, upon identifying any such material misstatement or omission in the Remarketing Materials, shall promptly notify the Fund. In the event of the failure of any such conditions with respect to the VRMM-MFP Shares, the Remarketing Agent may terminate its obligations under this Agreement with respect to the VRMM-MFP Shares as provided in Section 10(b).\n\nSection 9. Indemnification.\n\n(a) The Fund and the Investment Adviser, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Remarketing Agent and its respective officers, directors, employees and control persons within the meaning of the 1934 Act (collectively, the \"Indemnified Persons\" 9\n\n\n\n\n\nand individually, an \"Indemnified Person\") from and against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which any Indemnified Person may become subject insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any of the Remarketing Materials or the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading (except with respect to information provided by the Remarketing Agent specifically for use therein), or arise out of, or are based upon, any violation by the Fund or the Investment Adviser of, or any failure by the Fund or the Investment Adviser to perform, any of its obligations under, this Agreement. The Fund and the Investment Adviser agree to promptly reimburse each Indemnified Person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Person in investigating, defending or preparing to defend any such action or claim; provided, however, that neither the Fund nor the Investment Adviser shall be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of the use by the Remarketing Agent of any information that is not contained in the Remarketing Materials (in the form provided for use in connection with the remarketing). The indemnity agreement in this paragraph shall be in addition to any liability or obligation which the Fund or the Investment Adviser may otherwise have to any Indemnified Person and shall extend upon the same terms and conditions to each Person, if any, who controls any Indemnified Person within the meaning of the 1934 Act.\n\n(b) The Fund agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnified Persons from and against every loss, liability or expense, including without limitation, damages, fines, suits, actions, demands, costs, out-of-pocket expenses, and reasonable legal fees and expenses (collectively, \"Losses\"), that may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against, any Indemnified Person for or in respect of its (1) execution and delivery of this Agreement, (2) compliance or attempted compliance with or reliance upon any instruction or other direction upon which the Remarketing Agent is authorized to rely pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and (3) performance under this Agreement, except to the extent that the Loss resulted from such Indemnified Person's gross negligence, willful misconduct, bad faith, violations of law or violations of the terms and conditions of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Fund agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnified Persons from and against any and all Losses that may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against, any Indemnified Person for or in respect of the failure of the Remarketing Agent to deliver Remarketing Materials during the course of a remarketing, if such failure is due to the failure by the Fund to provide to the Remarketing Agent such Remarketing Materials for delivery (regardless of whether the Remarketing Agent has requested such Remarketing Materials), notwithstanding that such failure by the Remarketing Agent to deliver Remarketing Materials during the course of a Remarketing could be deemed a violation of law by an Indemnified Person. The indemnity agreement in this paragraph shall be in addition to any liability or obligation which the Fund may otherwise have to any Indemnified Person.\n\n(c) Each Indemnified Person shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each of the Fund and the Investment Adviser (collectively, the \"Indemnifying Persons\" and individually, an \"Indemnifying Person\") of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify the Indemnifying Persons 10\n\n\n\n\n\nshall not relieve any Indemnifying Person from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. No settlement or compromise of any such action shall be made without the consent of the Indemnifying Persons, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.\n\n(d) In case any such action is brought against any Indemnified Person, and it notifies each Indemnifying Person from which it seeks indemnification of the commencement thereof, such Indemnifying Person (which may be the Fund and/or the Investment Adviser, in the case of notification of either) will be entitled to participate in, and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other Indemnifying Person, similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof so long as its interests are not adverse to those of the Indemnified Person, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, and after notice from each Indemnifying Person to such Indemnified Person of its election to assume the defense thereof, the Indemnifying Person will not be liable to such Indemnified Person under this Section 9 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. Upon assumption by any Indemnifying Person of the defense of any such action or proceeding, the Indemnified Person shall have the right to participate in such action or proceeding and to retain its own counsel but the Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any legal expenses of other counsel subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the Indemnifying Person has agreed to pay such fees and expenses, (ii) the Indemnifying Person shall have failed to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person in a timely manner, or (iii) the Indemnified Person shall have been advised by counsel that there are actual or potential conflicting interests between the Indemnifying Persons and the Indemnified Person, including situations in which there are one or more legal defenses available to the Indemnified Person that are different from or additional to those available to each of the Fund and the Investment Adviser. If the Indemnifying Person elects not to assume the defense of any such suit, it will reimburse the Indemnified Persons for the reasonable fees and expenses of any counsel retained by them. In the event that the parties to any such action (including impleaded parties) include one or more Indemnifying Persons and one or more Indemnified Persons, and one or more Indemnified Persons shall have been advised by counsel reasonably satisfactory to each Indemnifying Person that there may be one or more legal defenses available to any of the Indemnified Persons, which are different from, additional to, or in conflict with those available to any of the Indemnifying Persons, the Indemnifying Persons will reimburse the Indemnified Persons for the reasonable fees and expenses of any counsel retained by the Indemnified Persons (it being understood that the Indemnifying Persons shall not, in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (plus local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, which firm shall be designated by the Indemnified Persons, the Remarketing Agent or each Indemnifying Person, as the case may be). Each Indemnifying Person agrees promptly to notify each Indemnified Person of the commencement of any litigation or proceedings against it in connection with the remarketing of the VRRM-MFP Shares. No Indemnifying Person shall consent to the terms of any compromise or settlement of any action defended by any Indemnifying Person in accordance with the foregoing without the prior consent of the Indemnified Person. No Indemnifying Person shall be liable under this Section 9 for the amount of any compromise or settlement of any action 11\n\n\n\n\n\nunless such compromise or settlement has been approved in writing by such Indemnifying Person, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.\n\n(e) If the indemnification provided for in subparagraph (a) of this Section 9 is unavailable, because of limitations imposed by securities laws or for any other reason, to a party that would otherwise have been an Indemnified Person under subparagraph (a) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then the party that would have been an Indemnifying Person thereunder shall, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion so that the Remarketing Agent is responsible for that portion represented by the percentage that the Remarketing Agent's fee (calculated for a one year period) with respect to such remarketing bears to the aggregate liquidation preference of such VRRM-MFP Shares being remarketed but will not exceed the amount of such fee (calculated for a one year period) and each of the Fund and the Investment Adviser is responsible for the balance; provided, however, that no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereon referred to above in this subparagraph (e)) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claims (which shall be limited as provided in this subparagraph (e) above if the Indemnifying Person has assumed the defense of any such action in accordance with the provisions thereof).\n\n(f) The indemnity agreements contained in clauses (a), (b) and (c) of this Section 9 shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Remarketing Agent, and shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement and the remarketing of any VRRM-MFP Shares hereunder.\n\nSection 10. Termination of Remarketing Agreement. (a) This Agreement shall terminate as to the Remarketing Agent and its obligations hereunder with respect to VRRM-MFP Shares upon the earliest to occur of (a) the effective date of the resignation or removal of such Remarketing Agent pursuant to Section 5(a) and Section 5(b), respectively, (b) the completion of a successful Transition Remarketing on a New Mode Commencement Date in connection with transition to a new Mode, or (c) the date on which no VRRM-MFP Shares are Outstanding.\n\n(b) In addition, the Remarketing Agent may terminate this Agreement and all of its obligations hereunder with respect to the VRRM-MFP Shares, by notifying the Fund and the Calculation and Paying Agent of its election to do so, if any of the conditions referred to or set forth in Section 8 hereof with respect to the VRRM-MFP Shares have not been met or satisfied in full and such failure shall have continued for a period of 30 days after the Remarketing Agent has given notice thereof to the Fund specifying the condition which has not been met and requiring it to be met; provided, however, that termination of this Agreement with respect to the VRRM-MFP Shares by the Remarketing Agent after giving the required notices with respect to the VRRM- MFP Shares shall be immediate in the event of the occurrence and continuation of 12\n\n\n\n\n\nany event set forth in Section 8(b)(i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) hereof with respect to the VRRM-MFP Shares, or in the event the Remarketing Agent determines, in its sole discretion, that it shall not have received all of the information, whether or not specifically referenced herein, necessary to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement with respect to the VRRM-MFP Shares.\n\nSection 11. Remarketing Agent's Performance; Duty of Care.\n\n(a) The duties and obligations of the Remarketing Agent shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this Agreement and the Supplement. No implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement, or the Supplement. In the absence of bad faith on the part of the Remarketing Agent, the Remarketing Agent may conclusively rely upon any document furnished to it, which purports to conform to the requirements of this Agreement and the Statement, as to the truth of the statements expressed in any of such documents. The Remarketing Agent shall be protected in acting upon any document or communication reasonably believed by it to have been signed, presented or made by the proper party or parties.

Fees and Expenses. For the performance of its services as Remarketing Agent hereunder, the Fund shall pay to the Remarketing Agent in arrears on the first day of each calendar month (or, if such day is not a Business Day, on the next succeeding Business Day) a monthly fee for each MFP Share Outstanding on the first calendar day of the preceding calendar month (or the date hereof in the case of the first such payment), in an amount, rounded upward to the nearest dollar, equal to (a) the product of (i) the rate of compensation as then in effect, as shall be agreed upon from time to time in writing by the Fund and the Remarketing Agent, times $[●] multiplied by (ii) the actual number of days from and including such first calendar day of the preceding calendar month (or the date hereof in the case of the first such payment) to and including the last calendar day of such preceding calendar month or, if applicable, the date of termination of this Agreement, if earlier, or the date of any prior redemption or liquidation for such share (as the case may be), divided by (b) 360.

Dealing in the VRRM-MFP Shares. The Remarketing Agent in its sole discretion may purchase for its own account VRRM-MFP Shares in a remarketing; however, subject to the last two sentences in Section 2(c) above, the Remarketing Agent shall not be obligated to purchase any VRRM-MFP Shares that would otherwise remain unsold in a 7\n\n\n\n\n\nremarketing.

The Remarketing Agent may exercise any vote or join in any action which any Holder of VRRM-MFP Shares may be entitled to exercise or take pursuant to the Statement with like effect as if it did not act in any capacity hereunder.

Conditions to Obligations of the Remarketing Agent. The obligations of the Remarketing Agent with respect to VRRM-MFP Shares under this Agreement have been undertaken in reliance on, and shall be subject to: (a) the due performance in all material respects by the Fund of its obligations and agreements as set forth in this Agreement (including Sections 3(c) and 7(b) hereof); and (b) the non-occurrence of any of the following events: (i) all of the VRRM-MFP Shares shall have been redeemed by the Fund; (ii) without the prior written consent of the Remarketing Agent, the Supplement, the Statement, the Declaration, the by-laws of the Fund, or the Tender and Paying Agent Agreement shall either not be in full force and effect or have been amended in any manner that in the reasonable opinion of the Remarketing Agent materially changes the nature of the VRRM- MFP Shares or the remarketing procedures; (iii) legislation, or a decision by a court of the United States shall be rendered, or a stop order, ruling, regulation or official statement by, or on behalf of, the Commission or other governmental agency having jurisdiction of the subject matter shall be made, to the effect that the offering or sale of the VRRM-MFP Shares is or would be in violation of any provision of the 1933 Act as then in effect, or the 1934 Act as then in effect, or with the purpose or effect of otherwise prohibiting the offering or sale of the VRRM-MFP Shares, as contemplated hereby, without registration under the 1933 Act; (iv) any legislation, resolution, ordinance, rule or regulation shall be enacted by, any governmental body, department or agency of the United States or the State of New York, or a decision by any court of competent jurisdiction within the United States or the State of New York shall be rendered, which, in the Remarketing Agent's reasonable opinion, materially adversely affects the marketability of the VRRM-MFP Shares; (v) additional material restrictions not in force as of the date hereof shall have been imposed upon trading in securities generally by any governmental authority or by any national securities exchange, which, in the Remarketing Agent's reasonable opinion, would cause the performance of the Remarketing Agent's obligations hereunder to violate applicable law; (vi) any litigation shall be instituted and be outstanding, to restrain or enjoin the sale or remarketing of the VRRM-MFP Shares or in any way protesting or affecting any authority of the Fund with respect to the validity of the VRRM- MFP Shares or this Agreement, or the existence or powers of the Fund to perform its obligations hereunder; (vii) a general banking moratorium has been declared by federal or New York authorities having jurisdiction, a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services or a force majeure event shall have occurred which in the reasonable opinion of the Remarketing Agent materially adversely affects the settlement or clearance of the VRRM-MFP Shares; or (viii) a material misstatement or omission in the Remarketing Materials has occurred, so that it is not advisable, in the reasonable judgment of the Remarketing Agent, to attempt to remarket the VRRM-MFP Shares, provided that the Remarketing Agent, upon identifying any such material misstatement or omission in the Remarketing Materials, shall promptly notify the Fund. In the event of the failure of any such conditions with respect to the VRMM-MFP Shares, the Remarketing Agent may terminate its obligations under this Agreement with respect to the VRMM-MFP Shares as provided in Section 10(b).\n\nSection 9. Indemnification.\n\n(a) The Fund and the Investment Adviser, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Remarketing Agent and its respective officers, directors, employees and control persons within the meaning of the 1934 Act (collectively, the \"Indemnified Persons\" 9\n\n\n\n\n\nand individually, an \"Indemnified Person\") from and against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which any Indemnified Person may become subject insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any of the Remarketing Materials or the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading (except with respect to information provided by the Remarketing Agent specifically for use therein), or arise out of, or are based upon, any violation by the Fund or the Investment Adviser of, or any failure by the Fund or the Investment Adviser to perform, any of its obligations under, this Agreement. The Fund and the Investment Adviser agree to promptly reimburse each Indemnified Person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Person in investigating, defending or preparing to defend any such action or claim; provided, however, that neither the Fund nor the Investment Adviser shall be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of the use by the Remarketing Agent of any information that is not contained in the Remarketing Materials (in the form provided for use in connection with the remarketing). The indemnity agreement in this paragraph shall be in addition to any liability or obligation which the Fund or the Investment Adviser may otherwise have to any Indemnified Person and shall extend upon the same terms and conditions to each Person, if any, who controls any Indemnified Person within the meaning of the 1934 Act.\n\n(b) The Fund agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnified Persons from and against every loss, liability or expense, including without limitation, damages, fines, suits, actions, demands, costs, out-of-pocket expenses, and reasonable legal fees and expenses (collectively, \"Losses\"), that may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against, any Indemnified Person for or in respect of its (1) execution and delivery of this Agreement, (2) compliance or attempted compliance with or reliance upon any instruction or other direction upon which the Remarketing Agent is authorized to rely pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and (3) performance under this Agreement, except to the extent that the Loss resulted from such Indemnified Person's gross negligence, willful misconduct, bad faith, violations of law or violations of the terms and conditions of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Fund agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnified Persons from and against any and all Losses that may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against, any Indemnified Person for or in respect of the failure of the Remarketing Agent to deliver Remarketing Materials during the course of a remarketing, if such failure is due to the failure by the Fund to provide to the Remarketing Agent such Remarketing Materials for delivery (regardless of whether the Remarketing Agent has requested such Remarketing Materials), notwithstanding that such failure by the Remarketing Agent to deliver Remarketing Materials during the course of a Remarketing could be deemed a violation of law by an Indemnified Person. The indemnity agreement in this paragraph shall be in addition to any liability or obligation which the Fund may otherwise have to any Indemnified Person.\n\n(c) Each Indemnified Person shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each of the Fund and the Investment Adviser (collectively, the \"Indemnifying Persons\" and individually, an \"Indemnifying Person\") of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify the Indemnifying Persons 10\n\n\n\n\n\nshall not relieve any Indemnifying Person from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. No settlement or compromise of any such action shall be made without the consent of the Indemnifying Persons, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.\n\n(d) In case any such action is brought against any Indemnified Person, and it notifies each Indemnifying Person from which it seeks indemnification of the commencement thereof, such Indemnifying Person (which may be the Fund and/or the Investment Adviser, in the case of notification of either) will be entitled to participate in, and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other Indemnifying Person, similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof so long as its interests are not adverse to those of the Indemnified Person, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, and after notice from each Indemnifying Person to such Indemnified Person of its election to assume the defense thereof, the Indemnifying Person will not be liable to such Indemnified Person under this Section 9 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. Upon assumption by any Indemnifying Person of the defense of any such action or proceeding, the Indemnified Person shall have the right to participate in such action or proceeding and to retain its own counsel but the Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any legal expenses of other counsel subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the Indemnifying Person has agreed to pay such fees and expenses, (ii) the Indemnifying Person shall have failed to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person in a timely manner, or (iii) the Indemnified Person shall have been advised by counsel that there are actual or potential conflicting interests between the Indemnifying Persons and the Indemnified Person, including situations in which there are one or more legal defenses available to the Indemnified Person that are different from or additional to those available to each of the Fund and the Investment Adviser. If the Indemnifying Person elects not to assume the defense of any such suit, it will reimburse the Indemnified Persons for the reasonable fees and expenses of any counsel retained by them. In the event that the parties to any such action (including impleaded parties) include one or more Indemnifying Persons and one or more Indemnified Persons, and one or more Indemnified Persons shall have been advised by counsel reasonably satisfactory to each Indemnifying Person that there may be one or more legal defenses available to any of the Indemnified Persons, which are different from, additional to, or in conflict with those available to any of the Indemnifying Persons, the Indemnifying Persons will reimburse the Indemnified Persons for the reasonable fees and expenses of any counsel retained by the Indemnified Persons (it being understood that the Indemnifying Persons shall not, in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (plus local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, which firm shall be designated by the Indemnified Persons, the Remarketing Agent or each Indemnifying Person, as the case may be). Each Indemnifying Person agrees promptly to notify each Indemnified Person of the commencement of any litigation or proceedings against it in connection with the remarketing of the VRRM-MFP Shares. No Indemnifying Person shall consent to the terms of any compromise or settlement of any action defended by any Indemnifying Person in accordance with the foregoing without the prior consent of the Indemnified Person.

Each time Manufacturer submits an order for Manufacturer's Products and Subcontractor accepts the order or ships the ordered Manufacturer's Products to Manufacturer, a new contract is formed consisting of this Agreement, the quantities and delivery dates specified in the order and the prices then offered by Subcontractor. ACCEPTANCE OF MANUFACTURER'S ORDER IS EXPRESSLY LIMITED TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, NOTWITHSTANDING ANY ORAL OR WRITTEN STATEMENT MADE BY MANUFACTURER, AND DOES NOT IN ANY WAY WHATSOEVER CONSTITUTE ACCEPTANCE OF MANUFACTURER'S TERMS AND CONDITIONS EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. NO TERMS AND CONDITIONS CONTAINED IN ANY PURCHASE ORDER FORM, WHETHER PROVIDED BY MANUFACTURER OR SUBCONTRACTOR, WILL BECOME A PART OF THE CONTRACT AND THIS CONTRACT WILL GOVERN ALL PURCHASES. Manufacturer's acceptance of or payment for Manufacturer's Products that Manufacturer has not ordered creates a contract comprised of this Agreement, the quantities of Manufacturer's Products accepted or paid for, and the prices then offered by Subcontractor. This Agreement shall constitute the entire agreement with respect to any contract formed and shall not be altered, amended, supplemented or canceled without the express written agreement of both Manufacturer and Subcontractor.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3 Product Prices. Pricing shall be the actual cost of the manufacturing of each Manufacturer's Product plus the proportional allocation of the costs of Subcontractor's manufacturing, engineering, and supply chain overhead, as mutually agreed by the Parties (the \"Product Cost\"). Title of the product will transfer to the Manufacturer at the shipping dock of the manufacturing facility. Manufacturer will be responsible for shipping costs. Manufacturer shall pay any taxes incurred in the manufacture of Manufacturer's Products, including any taxes incurred as a result of purchasing components or maintaining inventory. In addition to the Royalties paid under this Agreement to the Subcontractor, Manufacturer shall pay any other third-party royalties for technology that are required to manufacture the Manufacturer's Products for their intended purpose. As of the date of this Agreement neither Party is aware of any third-party royalties for technology that Manufacturer would be liable to pay. Subcontractor will provide Manufacturer with documentation substantiating any Product Cost variance upon request.\n\n3.4 Cost Reductions. Potential Product Cost reductions as a result of materials pricing will be reviewed and implemented periodically as mutually agreed and passed on to the Manufacturer. Product Cost reductions resulting from engineering changes or other changes, initiated by Manufacturer, that would impact either Product Costs or process changes at Subcontractor will be implemented at an agreed upon time. Manufacturer will be responsible for their proportionate share of any Product Cost reduction that is a result of engineering investment by the Subcontractor. If the Manufacturer does not pay its proportionate share, the Manufacturer will pay the Product Cost as if the cost reduction had not been made (i.e., the Product Cost prior to the cost reduction as if the cost reduction were not made). The Subcontractor will list the new Product Cost and a line item for engineering investment that accounts for the difference.\n\n3.5 Royalties. In addition to paying the Product Costs of Manufacturer's Products, Manufacturer shall also pay to Subcontractor the following royalty payments (each a \"Royalty\" and collectively the \"Royalties\") for each of Manufacturer's Product purchased under this Agreement. Royalties shall be paid 50% at time of shipping and the remaining balance of 50% due in 15-days after the Manufacturer's Products have shipped from the manufacturing facility. a) Non-Rechargeable Products. For Manufacturer's Products that are non-rechargeable, Manufacturer shall pay Subcontractor a Royalty equal to the higher of (i) eighty percent (80.0%) of the Product Cost; and (ii) $80 per unit. b) Rechargeable Products. For Manufacturer's Products that are rechargeable, Manufacturer shall pay Subcontractor a Royalty equal to the higher of (i) one hundred percent (100.0%) of the Product Cost; and (ii) $100 per unit. 3.6 Zounds' Products and Manufacturers Products Built to Manufacturer's Specifications. Subject to Section 7 below, Subcontractor agrees to manufacture Manufacturer's Products (i) that are identical to Zounds' Products allowing Manufacturer to utilize Subcontractor's existing product designs and features and/ or (ii) to specifications provided by Manufacturer from time to time with approval of such changes by Subcontractor. Any advice given by Subcontractor to Manufacturer before or after delivery of Products built to Manufacturer's specifications is based solely upon the information available to Subcontractor, and the use of such advice by Manufacturer is solely and entirely at Manufacturer's own risk. Manufacturer represents and warrants that it has independently determined the fitness, need, usefulness, and applicability of the Manufacturer's Products built to Manufacturer's specifications it has ordered and does not rely on any representation of Subcontractor in that regard.\n\n3.7 Engineering Services and Design Changes. Manufacturer may elect to utilize Subcontractor's design engineering resources (the \"Engineering and Design Services\") to further customize Manufacturer's Products. The cost of Engineering and Design Services to be paid by Manufacturer will be agreed to in a written document setting forth the scope, timing and other terms of such Engineering and Design Services executed by the Parties prior to any services being provided by Subcontractor. Subject to the written agreement of the parties with respect to any resulting change in price, delivery schedule and other terms, Subcontractor will accept design changes (i.e., Engineering Change Orders or \"ECO's\") according to Manufacturer's instructions.\n\n3.8 Tooling, Setup and Non-Recurring Engineering (\"NRE\") Charges. Subcontractor agrees to provide Manufacturer with a quote for any one-time tooling, setup or NRE charges payable by Manufacturer as a result of a change in design requested by Manufacturer, change in minimum quantity requirements by Manufacturer as originally quoted by Subcontractor, or an addition to the Manufacturer's Products purchased under this Agreement requested by Manufacturer. If Manufacturer elects to proceed with the design change, minimum quantity requirements change or addition as specified in Subcontractor's quote, Manufacturer will provide Subcontractor with written acceptance of Subcontractor's quoted terms.\n\n3.9 Inventory Reports. Subcontractor agrees to report its inventory position to Manufacturer on a monthly basis, including the following information: quantity of raw material, work in process and any open orders that cannot be cancelled to the supplier lead time. The report will specifically identify any material on hand or on order where the quantity exceeds the agreed three (3) month forward looking forecast plus safety stock as agreed upon by Subcontractor and Manufacturer. The Subcontractor and Manufacturer will review inventory levels and safety stocks quarterly.\n\n4. Delivery and Shipping. The agreed upon delivery dates are based on the Subcontractor's projected lead time, current inventory, commitments and Subcontractor's advice. Manufacturer agrees and acknowledges that all shipment dates are firm delivery dates. All shipments shall be F.O.B. the manufacturing facility unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing. The method and route of shipment shall be at Subcontractor's discretion, unless Manufacturer supplies instructions in writing at least five days prior to shipment. In addition to the purchase price, Manufacturer shall pay any and all transportation charges (including insurance). The risk of loss of and title to the Manufacturer's Products pass to Manufacturer upon the receipt of the Manufacturer's Products by the carrier. Subcontractor is not responsible for any installation of Manufacturer's Products sold\n\n\n\n\n\nhereunder or delays caused by Manufacturer-specified suppliers.\n\n5. Leased Space Agreement. Manufacturer will lease from Subcontractor a well-defined space for Manufacturer's Products within the Subcontractor's current FDA registered manufacturer's facility. Subcontractor is solely responsible for maintaining all aspects of such leased space including but not limited to; (i) segregation of Manufacturer's Products with all Manufacturer's Products clearly segregated and marked; and (ii) meeting all necessary requirements deemed appropriate by the FDA and any regulatory authorities for a medical device manufacturer's facility. Subcontractor will be also solely responsible for remaining in good standings at all times with all regulatory authorities including but not limited to the standards set forth by the FDA for medical device manufacturing facilities. The Manufacturer may list the address of the Subcontractor's current FDA registered manufacturer's facility as the Manufacturer's own FDA approved manufacturer's facility for the Manufacturer's Products. The terms of such lease agreement will be mutually agreed to by the Parties in a separate document.\n\n6. Payment Terms. Upon Subcontractor's approval and acceptance of a production forecast provided by Manufacturer, Manufacturer's payment for Manufacturer's Products will be due when forecasted materials or components must be ordered by the Subcontractor as set forth in Section 3 above. A schedule of the forecast payables will be provided by the Subcontractor to the Manufacturer based on the approved forecast. Components and products will only be procured and/or manufactured once payment has been received. All payments will be made by electronic wire transfer and all of the appropriate forms will need to be signed so that this can happen efficiently. Alternately, payments can be made to Subcontractor's address as shown Subcontractor's invoice. No offsets are allowed to be taken by either Party. Manufacturer represents that all sales to Manufacturer under this Agreement are sales for use in production or resale; therefore no sales, use, excise or other taxes are due as a result of such sales and Manufacturer will be responsible for payment of any such taxes. A copy of the Manufacturer's resale certificate will be provided by Manufacturer within 15-days of the Effective Date.\n\n7. Limited Warranty; Nonconforming Products. Since Manufacturer is paying the actual manufacturing cost of the product, Supplier has not reserved for any warranty related costs. The Manufacturer acknowledges that it is solely responsible for any warranty costs associated with Manufacturer's Products. Should any nonconformities be detected during or after the manufacturing process, Subcontractor will assist Manufacturer in resolving any quality issues with the suppliers. Subcontractor will provide support to Manufacturer to train Manufacturer's employees to repair the non-conforming products as appropriate. Upon Manufacturer's request, Subcontractor will provide repair services for a fee equal to the actual cost of these services. In the event Manufacturer in good faith believes that Manufacturer's Products are nonconforming under the specifications agreed to among the Parties (the \"Standards\"), Manufacturer shall give written notice to Subcontractor specifying in detail the nonconformity within thirty (30) days of Manufacturer's receipt of such Manufacturer's Products. Upon Manufacturer's request, Subcontractor will facilitate such Manufacturer's Products being repaired or replaced, Manufacturer must return the Manufacturer's Products to Subcontractor, transportation charges prepaid by Manufacturer, within fifteen (15) days of the end of such thirty (30) date notice period.

        "Exhibit 10.1 MANUFACTURING, DESIGN AND MARKETING AGREEMENT This MANUFACTURING, DESIGN AND MARKETING AGREEMENT (this \"Agreement\") is entered into by and between Zounds Hearing, Inc., a Delaware corporation (\"Subcontractor\") and InnerScope Hearing Technologies, Inc., a Nevada corporation, (the \"Manufacturer\") Manufacturer dated effective October 3, 2018 (the \"Effective Date\"). Subcontractor and Manufacturer may also be referred to herein individually as \"Party\" or collectively as the \"Parties\". RECITALS WHEREAS, Subcontractor currently is the registered manufacturer of hearing aids and related components and accessories (the \"Zounds Products\") that are sold under the Subcontractor's brand names through various marketing and distribution channels. WHEREAS the Parties desire to enter an agreement whereby the Subcontractor as the Manufacturer's subcontractor will provide design, technology, manufacturing and supply chain services to the Manufacturer to enable the Manufacturer to manufacture comparable hearing aids and related components and accessories to be sold under Manufacturer's exclusive brand names (the \"Manufacturer's Products\") through the Manufacturer's various marketing and distribution channels. WHEREAS, the Parties also desire to enter into a lease agreement of Subcontractor's current Chandler, Arizona facility that provides the Manufacturer an FDA medical device facility for the Manufacturer's Products. WHEREAS, the Parties also desire to enter into an agreement that provides for the joint marketing and sale of each other's products. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and covenants contained herein, the Parties hereby agree as follows: 1. Term. Subject to earlier termination as provided in this Agreement, the initial term of this Agreement shall be for a period beginning on the Effective Date and ending ten (10) years thereafter unless this Agreement is terminated earlier as provided herein. This Agreement will renew automatically thereafter for successive one-year terms unless and until one Party gives notification of termination with at least sixty (60) days written notice. All orders placed under this Agreement must be placed prior to the expiration or termination of this Agreement.\n\n2. Technology Access Fee. Manufacturer will pay Subcontractor One Million and No/100 USD ($1,000,000) (the \"Technology Access Fee\"). The Technology Access Fee will be paid in two equal installments of $500,000 each. The first installment will be due thirty (30) days following the Effective Date and the second installment will be due sixty (60) days following the Effective Date.\n\n3. Orders for Manufacturer's Products to be Manufactured by Subcontractor\n\n3.1 Purchase Orders: Excess Inventory. Manufacturer shall provide to Subcontractor a purchase order setting forth the proposed quantity of Manufacturer's Products to be purchased by Manufacturer and delivery dates, which purchase order will be subject to written acceptance by Subcontractor. All purchase orders are non-cancellable, and the Manufacturer shall pay for the purchaser orders as follows: (i) for purchase orders for less than or equal to a total of five hundred (500) units in any given calendar month, payment of fifty percent (50%) of Product Cost (as defined below) shall be made in full at the time the order is placed and the remaining balance paid in full before the Manufacturer's Products are shipped; and (ii) for purchase orders for more than five hundred (500) units in any given calendar month, payment of one hundred percent (100%) of Product Cost shall be made in full at the time the order is placed. Manufacturer's purchase orders accepted by Subcontractor and any forecast provided to Subcontractor by Manufacturer will constitute authorization for Subcontractor to procure product components to manufacture the Manufacturer's Products covered by such purchase orders based on their lead times. Subcontractor will advise Manufacturer of the lead time of components contained within their order and any forecast and Manufacturer will pay for the components prior to the Subcontractor placing orders for the components.\n\n3.2 Contract Formation: Acceptance and Entire Agreement. Each time Manufacturer submits an order for Manufacturer's Products and Subcontractor accepts the order or ships the ordered Manufacturer's Products to Manufacturer, a new contract is formed consisting of this Agreement, the quantities and delivery dates specified in the order and the prices then offered by Subcontractor. ACCEPTANCE OF MANUFACTURER'S ORDER IS EXPRESSLY LIMITED TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, NOTWITHSTANDING ANY ORAL OR WRITTEN STATEMENT MADE BY MANUFACTURER, AND DOES NOT IN ANY WAY WHATSOEVER CONSTITUTE ACCEPTANCE OF MANUFACTURER'S TERMS AND CONDITIONS EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. NO TERMS AND CONDITIONS CONTAINED IN ANY PURCHASE ORDER FORM, WHETHER PROVIDED BY MANUFACTURER OR SUBCONTRACTOR, WILL BECOME A PART OF THE CONTRACT AND THIS CONTRACT WILL GOVERN ALL PURCHASES. Manufacturer's acceptance of or payment for Manufacturer's Products that Manufacturer has not ordered creates a contract comprised of this Agreement, the quantities of Manufacturer's Products accepted or paid for, and the prices then offered by Subcontractor. This Agreement shall constitute the entire agreement with respect to any contract formed and shall not be altered, amended, supplemented or canceled without the express written agreement of both Manufacturer and Subcontractor.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3 Product Prices. Pricing shall be the actual cost of the manufacturing of each Manufacturer's Product plus the proportional allocation of the costs of Subcontractor's manufacturing, engineering, and supply chain overhead, as mutually agreed by the Parties (the \"Product Cost\"). Title of the product will transfer to the Manufacturer at the shipping dock of the manufacturing facility. Manufacturer will be responsible for shipping costs. Manufacturer shall pay any taxes incurred in the manufacture of Manufacturer's Products, including any taxes incurred as a result of purchasing components or maintaining inventory. In addition to the Royalties paid under this Agreement to the Subcontractor, Manufacturer shall pay any other third-party royalties for technology that are required to manufacture the Manufacturer's Products for their intended purpose. As of the date of this Agreement neither Party is aware of any third-party royalties for technology that Manufacturer would be liable to pay. Subcontractor will provide Manufacturer with documentation substantiating any Product Cost variance upon request.\n\n3.4 Cost Reductions. Potential Product Cost reductions as a result of materials pricing will be reviewed and implemented periodically as mutually agreed and passed on to the Manufacturer. Product Cost reductions resulting from engineering changes or other changes, initiated by Manufacturer, that would impact either Product Costs or process changes at Subcontractor will be implemented at an agreed upon time. Manufacturer will be responsible for their proportionate share of any Product Cost reduction that is a result of engineering investment by the Subcontractor. If the Manufacturer does not pay its proportionate share, the Manufacturer will pay the Product Cost as if the cost reduction had not been made (i.e., the Product Cost prior to the cost reduction as if the cost reduction were not made). The Subcontractor will list the new Product Cost and a line item for engineering investment that accounts for the difference.\n\n3.5 Royalties. In addition to paying the Product Costs of Manufacturer's Products, Manufacturer shall also pay to Subcontractor the following royalty payments (each a \"Royalty\" and collectively the \"Royalties\") for each of Manufacturer's Product purchased under this Agreement. Royalties shall be paid 50% at time of shipping and the remaining balance of 50% due in 15-days after the Manufacturer's Products have shipped from the manufacturing facility. a) Non-Rechargeable Products. For Manufacturer's Products that are non-rechargeable, Manufacturer shall pay Subcontractor a Royalty equal to the higher of (i) eighty percent (80.0%) of the Product Cost; and (ii) $80 per unit. b) Rechargeable Products. For Manufacturer's Products that are rechargeable, Manufacturer shall pay Subcontractor a Royalty equal to the higher of (i) one hundred percent (100.0%) of the Product Cost; and (ii) $100 per unit. 3.6 Zounds' Products and Manufacturers Products Built to Manufacturer's Specifications. Subject to Section 7 below, Subcontractor agrees to manufacture Manufacturer's Products (i) that are identical to Zounds' Products allowing Manufacturer to utilize Subcontractor's existing product designs and features and/ or (ii) to specifications provided by Manufacturer from time to time with approval of such changes by Subcontractor. Any advice given by Subcontractor to Manufacturer before or after delivery of Products built to Manufacturer's specifications is based solely upon the information available to Subcontractor, and the use of such advice by Manufacturer is solely and entirely at Manufacturer's own risk. Manufacturer represents and warrants that it has independently determined the fitness, need, usefulness, and applicability of the Manufacturer's Products built to Manufacturer's specifications it has ordered and does not rely on any representation of Subcontractor in that regard.\n\n3.7 Engineering Services and Design Changes. Manufacturer may elect to utilize Subcontractor's design engineering resources (the \"Engineering and Design Services\") to further customize Manufacturer's Products. The cost of Engineering and Design Services to be paid by Manufacturer will be agreed to in a written document setting forth the scope, timing and other terms of such Engineering and Design Services executed by the Parties prior to any services being provided by Subcontractor. Subject to the written agreement of the parties with respect to any resulting change in price, delivery schedule and other terms, Subcontractor will accept design changes (i.e., Engineering Change Orders or \"ECO's\") according to Manufacturer's instructions.\n\n3.8 Tooling, Setup and Non-Recurring Engineering (\"NRE\") Charges. Subcontractor agrees to provide Manufacturer with a quote for any one-time tooling, setup or NRE charges payable by Manufacturer as a result of a change in design requested by Manufacturer, change in minimum quantity requirements by Manufacturer as originally quoted by Subcontractor, or an addition to the Manufacturer's Products purchased under this Agreement requested by Manufacturer. If Manufacturer elects to proceed with the design change, minimum quantity requirements change or addition as specified in Subcontractor's quote, Manufacturer will provide Subcontractor with written acceptance of Subcontractor's quoted terms.\n\n3.9 Inventory Reports. Subcontractor agrees to report its inventory position to Manufacturer on a monthly basis, including the following information: quantity of raw material, work in process and any open orders that cannot be cancelled to the supplier lead time. The report will specifically identify any material on hand or on order where the quantity exceeds the agreed three (3) month forward looking forecast plus safety stock as agreed upon by Subcontractor and Manufacturer. The Subcontractor and Manufacturer will review inventory levels and safety stocks quarterly.\n\n4. Delivery and Shipping. The agreed upon delivery dates are based on the Subcontractor's projected lead time, current inventory, commitments and Subcontractor's advice. Manufacturer agrees and acknowledges that all shipment dates are firm delivery dates. All shipments shall be F.O.B. the manufacturing facility unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing. The method and route of shipment shall be at Subcontractor's discretion, unless Manufacturer supplies instructions in writing at least five days prior to shipment. In addition to the purchase price, Manufacturer shall pay any and all transportation charges (including insurance). The risk of loss of and title to the Manufacturer's Products pass to Manufacturer upon the receipt of the Manufacturer's Products by the carrier. Subcontractor is not responsible for any installation of Manufacturer's Products sold\n\n\n\n\n\nhereunder or delays caused by Manufacturer-specified suppliers.\n\n5. Leased Space Agreement. Manufacturer will lease from Subcontractor a well-defined space for Manufacturer's Products within the Subcontractor's current FDA registered manufacturer's facility. Subcontractor is solely responsible for maintaining all aspects of such leased space including but not limited to; (i) segregation of Manufacturer's Products with all Manufacturer's Products clearly segregated and marked; and (ii) meeting all necessary requirements deemed appropriate by the FDA and any regulatory authorities for a medical device manufacturer's facility. Subcontractor will be also solely responsible for remaining in good standings at all times with all regulatory authorities including but not limited to the standards set forth by the FDA for medical device manufacturing facilities. The Manufacturer may list the address of the Subcontractor's current FDA registered manufacturer's facility as the Manufacturer's own FDA approved manufacturer's facility for the Manufacturer's Products. The terms of such lease agreement will be mutually agreed to by the Parties in a separate document.\n\n6. Payment Terms. Upon Subcontractor's approval and acceptance of a production forecast provided by Manufacturer, Manufacturer's payment for Manufacturer's Products will be due when forecasted materials or components must be ordered by the Subcontractor as set forth in Section 3 above. A schedule of the forecast payables will be provided by the Subcontractor to the Manufacturer based on the approved forecast. Components and products will only be procured and/or manufactured once payment has been received. All payments will be made by electronic wire transfer and all of the appropriate forms will need to be signed so that this can happen efficiently. Alternately, payments can be made to Subcontractor's address as shown Subcontractor's invoice. No offsets are allowed to be taken by either Party. Manufacturer represents that all sales to Manufacturer under this Agreement are sales for use in production or resale; therefore no sales, use, excise or other taxes are due as a result of such sales and Manufacturer will be responsible for payment of any such taxes. A copy of the Manufacturer's resale certificate will be provided by Manufacturer within 15-days of the Effective Date.\n\n7. Limited Warranty; Nonconforming Products. Since Manufacturer is paying the actual manufacturing cost of the product, Supplier has not reserved for any warranty related costs. The Manufacturer acknowledges that it is solely responsible for any warranty costs associated with Manufacturer's Products. Should any nonconformities be detected during or after the manufacturing process, Subcontractor will assist Manufacturer in resolving any quality issues with the suppliers. Subcontractor will provide support to Manufacturer to train Manufacturer's employees to repair the non-conforming products as appropriate. Upon Manufacturer's request, Subcontractor will provide repair services for a fee equal to the actual cost of these services. In the event Manufacturer in good faith believes that Manufacturer's Products are nonconforming under the specifications agreed to among the Parties (the \"Standards\"), Manufacturer shall give written notice to Subcontractor specifying in detail the nonconformity within thirty (30) days of Manufacturer's receipt of such Manufacturer's Products. Upon Manufacturer's request, Subcontractor will facilitate such Manufacturer's Products being repaired or replaced, Manufacturer must return the Manufacturer's Products to Subcontractor, transportation charges prepaid by Manufacturer, within fifteen (15) days of the end of such thirty (30) date notice period.

Subcontractor, in providing Manufacturer's Products hereunder, is acting as an independent contractor and does not undertake by this Agreement or otherwise to perform any obligation of Manufacturer, or to assume liability for Manufacturer's business or operations. Subcontractor has the sole right and obligation to supervise, manage, contract, direct, procure, perform, or cause to be performed, all work to be performed by Subcontractor hereunder.\n\n15.4 Right of Subcontractor to Sell Products to Others. Manufacturer understands and agrees that Subcontractor may itself use, manufacture or sell similar products as provided to Manufacturer hereunder to third parties and affiliates, some of whom may be competitors of Manufacturer, so long as: (a) Subcontractor does not use or disclose any Confidential Information of Manufacturer, (b) Subcontractor and third party do not infringe any of Manufacturer's patents or other intellectual property rights.\n\n15.5 No Third Party Beneficiaries. The Parties agree that this Agreement is for the benefit of the Parties hereto only and is not intended to confer any legal rights or benefits on any third party, and that there are no third party beneficiaries to this Agreement or any part or specific provision of this Agreement.\n\n15.6 Attorneys' Fees. The prevailing Party in any legal proceedings brought by or against the other Party to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall be entitled to recover against the non-prevailing Party the reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs and other expenses incurred by the prevailing Party. 15.7 Assignment; Change of Control. Neither Party may assign or transfer this Agreement by operation of law or otherwise. Any assignment made by either Party in contravention of this Section 15.7 shall be null and void for all purposes. In the event of a Change of Control (as defined below) this Agreement shall immediately terminate. A Change of Control shall occur with respect to the Manufacturer, unless Subcontractor shall have expressly consented to such Change of Control in writing. A \"Change of Control\" shall mean any event or circumstance as a result of which (i) any \"Person\" or \"group\" (as such terms are defined in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \"Exchange Act\"), as in effect on the date hereof), other than the Subcontractor, is or becomes the \"beneficial owner\" (as defined in Rules 13(d)-3 and 13(d)-5 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of 50% or more on a fully diluted basis of the then outstanding voting equity interest of the Company, (ii) the board of directors of the Manufacturer shall cease to consist of a majority of the Manufacturer's board of directors on the date hereof (or directors appointed by a majority of the board of directors in effect immediately prior to such appointment) or (iii) the Manufacturer or any of its affiliates merges or consolidates with, or sells all or substantially all of its assets to, any other person or entity; 15.8 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended only by written amendment duly signed by authorized representatives of both Parties.\n\n15.9 Non-Solicitation of Employees. During the term hereof and for a period of five (5) years thereafter, each Party agrees not to, either directly or indirectly, for itself or on behalf of any other person, firm, partnership, corporation or other entity hire, solicit, contract for, attempt to solicit, or cause to be solicited, the employment or services of any current or previous employee of the other Party (unless a period of sixty months has elapsed from the last date that such employee was employed by such party) without the prior written consent of such other Party. Each Party agrees that in the event it violates the provisions of this Section 15.9, it will pay to the other Party as liquidated damages, and not as a penalty, an amount equal to one hundred times (100 X) of any such employee's then-current base annual salary. 15.10 Severability; Validity. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, the parties agree to renegotiate such provision(s) in good faith, in order to maintain or achieve the economic position enjoyed by each Party as close as possible to that under the provision(s) rendered unenforceable. In the event that the Parties cannot reach a mutually agreeable and enforceable replacement for such provision(s), then (i) such provisions shall be excluded from this Agreement, (ii) the balance of the Agreement shall be interpreted as if such provision(s) were so excluded, (iii) the balance of the Agreement shall be enforceable in accordance with its terms, and (iv) the parties will revise the Agreement to effect the intent of such excluded provisions. 15.11 Waiver. Any waiver of any kind by a Party of a breach of this Agreement must be in writing, shall be effective only to the extent set forth in such writing and shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach. Any delay or omission in exercising any right, power or remedy pursuant to a breach or default by a Party shall not impair any right, power or remedy which either Party may have with respect to a future breach or default.\n\n15.12 Dispute Resolution. 15.12.1 Obligation to Negotiate. Any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be resolved exclusively in accordance with the procedures specified in this Section 15.12. The Parties shall attempt in good faith to resolve any\n\n\n\n\n\ndispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement by negotiation between a committee composed of four (4) members (two (2) from each Party) mutually agreed upon from the Subcontractor and Manufacturer boards of directors. Any Party may give the other Party written notice of any dispute not resolved in the normal course of business. Such notice shall include (a) a statement of that Party's position and a summary of arguments supporting that position, and (b) the name and title of the executive who will be representing that Party and of any other person who will accompany the executive in the negotiations. Within fifteen (15) days after delivery of the notice, the receiving Party shall respond with (a) a statement of that Party's position and a summary of arguments supporting that position, and (b) the name and title of the executive who will represent that Party and of any other person who will accompany the executive in the negotiations. Within thirty (30) days after delivery of the initial notice, the executives of both Parties shall meet at a mutually acceptable time and place and thereafter as often as they reasonably deem necessary to attempt to resolve the dispute. All reasonable requests for information made by one Party to the other will be honored. All negotiations pursuant to this clause are confidential and shall be treated as compromise and settlement negotiations for purposes of applicable rules of evidence. 15.12.2 Mediation. If the dispute has not been resolved by the negotiation process specified in Section 15.12.1 within forty-five (45) days following the initial notice, the Parties may endeavor to settle the dispute by mediation under the then current CPR Mediation Procedure published by the CPR Institute for Dispute Resolution (NYC). Unless otherwise agreed, the Parties will select a mediator from the CPR Panels of Distinguished Neutrals. 15.12.3 Choice of Law; Venue. If any dispute has not been resolved by a non-binding procedure as provided herein, within one-hundred twenty (120) days of the initiation of such procedure the complaining Party may seek such legal or equitable relief as may be appropriate in the federal or state courts located in Maricopa County, Arizona. The Parties agree that this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Arizona without regard to conflicts of law provisions thereof or any other applicable law and that exclusive venue shall be in the federal or state courts located in Maricopa County, Arizona. Nothing stated herein is intended to limit either Party's right to seek emergency, temporary or permanent injunctive relief and both Parties expressly agree that either Party will be entitled to such relief to prevent actual or threatened violation of the confidentiality provisions in Section 11 herein. If there is a dispute or legal action regarding this agreement, the prevailing Party shall be entitled to reasonable attorney's fees and costs. 15.13 Binding Effect; Recitals. This Agreement shall be binding on and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and assigns. The recitals to this Agreement are incorporated into and shall constitute a part of this Agreement.\n\n15.14 Survival. The rights, limitations, obligations and duties under Sections 7, 10, 11, 12, 14 and 15 shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement. 15.15 Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the attachments attached hereto contain the entire agreement of the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, and supersede all prior negotiations, agreements and understandings with respect thereto.

All written Confidential Information (including, without limitation, in any computer or other electronic format) which comes into Maimon's possession during the Service Term shall remain the property of the Company. Except as required in the performance of Maimon's duties for the Company, or unless expressly authorized in writing by the Company, Maimon shall not remove any written Confidential Information from the Company's premises, except in connection with the performance of his duties for the Company and in a manner consistent with the Company's policies regarding Confidential Information.

This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, and shall be binding upon, the parties hereto and their respective successors, permitted assigns, heirs and legal representatives. 2\n\n\n\n\n\n11. Entire Agreement; Amendments.

This Agreement may not be changed orally, but only by an agreement in writing signed by the party against whom any waiver, change, amendment, modification or discharge is sought. 12. Severability. The invalidity of all or any part of any provision of this Agreement shall not render invalid the remainder of this Agreement or the remainder of such provision. If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, such provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable. 13. Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of the State of New York without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of law thereof.

      "response": "Yes, based on the information provided in the Services Agreement, the parties have certain obligations that continue after the termination or expiration of the contract:\n\n1. Confidentiality Obligations: Section 7 of the agreement states that Maimon covenants that even after the termination of the agreement, he will not use or divulge any of the Company's confidential information, unless such information is in the public domain through no fault of his or except when required by law.\n\n2. Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation Obligations: Section 8 states that for a period of two (2) years after the expiration or termination of the agreement, Maimon agrees not to compete with the Company's business or solicit the Company's customers, clients, vendors, suppliers, employees, consultants, or agents.\n\nThese post-termination obligations suggest that the parties have certain continuing commitments and responsibilities even after the agreement has ended. The agreement does not mention any specific post-termination transition, payment, transfer of IP, wind-down, or last-buy obligations, but the confidentiality and non-competition/non-solicitation clauses indicate that the parties have ongoing duties that extend beyond the termination of the contract.",

This Agreement (including its Exhibit A and all other documents referenced herein) is entered into by eGain Communications Corporation (\"eGain\") and Eliance Corporation (\"Customer\") for the purpose of providing Customer with Web-based access to eGain's software specified in Exhibit A, including any updates, upgrades or revisions provided under this Agreement (\"Software\"), and certain other services relating to the processing of and response to online inquiries and messages (\"Online Messages\") received by Customer from its customers and other users of Customer's Web site (\"Users\").\n\n2. Provision of Services. eGain will provide Customer with access, maintenance and related hosting services (\"Hosting Services\") to the Software installed on eGain's servers and other equipment (the \"eGain System\"). Customer agrees, as reasonably requested by eGain, to provide eGain with access to Customer's premises and equipment and to otherwise cooperate with eGain in performing the services. During the term of this Agreement, Customer may obtain information (\"Reports\") regarding Customer's use of the Software and the quantity and handling of Online Messages routed to the eGain System by accessing the eGain System through a password-protected Web site made available by eGain. Customer shall be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of such passwords and shall permit only authorized employees of Customer to access the eGain System. The Hosting Services, and the hosting fees specified in Exhibit A, do not include any deployment, training or other consulting or professional services which, if applicable, will be specified in a Statement of Work, signed by both parties, and incorporated herein by this reference.\n\n2.1 Customer Support. eGain will provide live telephone support to Customer 24-hours-a-day, seven-days-a-week by a trained eGain customer support representative.\n\n3. Customer's Responsibilities. Customer agrees that it shall be responsible for providing and maintaining its own Internet access and all necessary telecommunications equipment, software and other materials (\"Customer Equipment\") at Customer's location necessary for accessing the Software and the eGain System through the Internet. Customer agrees to notify eGain of any changes in the Customer Equipment, including any system configuration changes or any hardware or software upgrades, which may affect the Hosting Services provided hereunder. The eGain System is only to be used for lawful purposes. Customer agrees not to transmit, re-transmit or store materials on or through the eGain System or the Software that are harmful to the eGain System or Software, or in violation of any applicable laws or regulations, including without limitation laws relating to infringement of intellectual property and proprietary rights of others. To the extent that certain components of the Software may be downloaded to Customer's or User's computer as a result of accessing the Software as part of the Hosting Services, eGain grants Customers a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license, with right to sublicense solely to Users, to use such Software only in connection with the Hosting Services. Neither Customer nor Users are otherwise permitted to use the Software, nor will Customer or Users disassemble, decompile or otherwise attempt to discern the source code of such Software. Customer agrees that, except as expressly set forth in this Section and in Section 11, it will not rent, lease, sublicense, re-sell, time-share or otherwise assign to any third party this Agreement or any of Customer's rights or licenses to access the Software or the eGain System, nor shall Customer use, or authorize others to use, the Software, Hosting Services or the eGain System to operate a service bureau. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, Customer shall be permitted to provide access to the eGain System to its employees and agents located worldwide.\n\n4. Proprietary Rights. Except for the limited access right granted to Customer in this Agreement, all right, title and interest in and to the Software (including any and all modifications as a result of any implementation services rendered) and the eGain System are and shall remain the exclusive property of eGain and its licensors. eGain acknowledges and agrees that the Online Messages are the property of Customer and that eGain has only a limited right to use the Online Messages as set forth in the following sentence. Notwithstanding the foregoing, eGain may access and disclose the Online Messages solely as necessary to provide the Hosting Services, to operate and maintain its systems, to comply with applicable laws and government orders and requests, and to protect itself and its customers.\n\n5. Pricing and Payment. Customer agrees to pay the fees and other charges for the Hosting Services and other services provided under this Agreement as specified in Exhibit A of this Agreement. CUSTOMER AGREES TO PAY FOR HOSTING SERVICES ON OR BEFORE THE FIRST DAY OF THE MONTH IN WHICH THE HOSTING SERVICES ARE PROVIDED, except that, with respect to Additional Fees (as defined in Exhibit A), eGain will invoice Customer for such Fees in the month after the month in which such fees accrue as provided in Exhibit A. All amounts payable hereunder are exclusive of any and all taxes, and Customer is responsible for payment of such taxes (excluding taxes based on eGain's net income). All prices are stated, and Customer shall pay, in United States dollars. Payment received by eGain after the due date shall be subject to a late fee equal to one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month, or, if less, the maximum amount allowed by applicable law. At the end of the initial one-year term of this Agreement and any subsequent one-year terms, eGain may adjust the monthly fee payable under this Agreement by providing Customer written notice of such adjustment at least sixty (60) days prior to the beginning of the new term.\n\n6. Limited Warranties; Disclaimer of Warranties.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1 eGain warrants and represents to Customer that (i) the Software will perform substantially in accordance with the documentation, if any, provided by eGain to Customer, and (ii) the Hosting Services will be performed in a professional and workmanlike manner and in accordance with Section 2. In the event of Downtime (as defined in this Section 6.1 below), as Customer's sole and exclusive remedy and eGain's sole and exclusive liability, the monthly fee payable for the Hosting Services shall be reduced as follows:\n\na) For the first sixty (60) minutes of Downtime during Normal Business       Hours or the first four (4) hours of Downtime outside of Normal Business       Hours (\"Initial Downtime\"), eGain will credit Customer's account for one       (1) day of service.\n\nb) For each eight (8) hour period of Downtime per day in addition to the       Initial Downtime, eGain will credit Customer's account for one (1)       additional day of service.\n\nFor the purposes of this Agreement, \"Downtime\" shall mean any interruption in the availability of Hosting Services to Customer (excluding scheduled interruptions of which Customer is notified 48 hours in advanced), only if such interruption is due either to: 1) an error in the Software, or 2) failure of the eGain System (but not including problems associated with Internet connectivity). Downtime begins upon Customer notification to eGain of the interruption, either\n\neGAIN COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION\n\nHOSTING AGREEMENT\n\nby speaking directly with an eGain customer service representative or recording a voice mail message in the eGain customer service voice mail box, and continues until the availability of the Hosting Services is restored to the Customer. For purposes of this Agreement, \"Normal Business Hours\" shall mean between the hours of 6:00 a.m to 6:00 p.m. Pacific time, Monday through Friday excluding national holidays.\n\nIn the event of a breach (other than Downtime) of the warranty set forth in Section 6.1(i) above, Customer's sole and exclusive remedy, and eGain's sole and exclusive liability shall be, at eGain's option, repair or replacement of the Software.\n\nTHE FOREGOING CONSTITUTES CUSTOMER'S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY, AND eGAIN'S ENTIRE LIABILITY, FOR DOWNTIME AND FOR BREACH OF THE HOSTING SERVICES WARRANTY PROVIDED IN THIS SECTION 6.1.\n\n6.2 eGain represents and warrants that, prior to, during and after the calendar year 2000 A.D., the Software and the eGain System will process, calculate, manipulate, sort, store and transfer date data without material error or material performance degradation, including without limitation date data which represents or references different centuries or more than one century (such representation and warranty being referred to as \"Year 2000 Compliant\"). In the event that the Software or eGain System is not Year 2000 Compliant, Customer's sole and exclusive remedy and eGain's sole and exclusive liability shall be for eGain, at no additional cost to Customer, to promptly modify the Software or the eGain System so that the Software or eGain System is Year 2000 Compliant. The foregoing warranty is conditioned upon the Customer using the Software and/or the eGain System in accordance with its applicable Documentation, and on other software, hardware, network and systems (other than the Software and the eGain System) with which the Software and/or the eGain System interface or interoperate also being Year 2000 Compliant.\n\n6.3 EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SECTIONS 6.1-6.2, (A) THE HOSTING SERVICES ARE PROVIDED, AND THE SOFTWARE AND THE eGAIN SYSTEM ARE MADE AVAILABLE, BY eGAIN TO CUSTOMER \"AS IS,\" AND (B) eGAIN AND ITS SUPPLIERS MAKE NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, REGARDING THE HOSTING SERVICES, THE SOFTWARE OR THE eGAIN SYSTEM, AND SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND AGAINST INFRINGEMENT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT POSSIBLE BY LAW.\n\n6.4 Without limiting the express warranties set forth in this Agreement, eGain does not warrant that the Software, the eGain System or the Hosting Services will meet Customer's requirements (except as provided in Section 6.1) or that Customer's access to and use of the Software, the eGain System or the Hosting Services will be uninterrupted or free of errors or omissions. eGain cannot and does not guarantee the privacy, security, authenticity and non-corruption of any information transmitted through, or stored in any system connected to, the Internet. eGain will use commercially reasonable efforts to adequately maintain, and upgrade as necessary, the eGain System to provide the Hosting Services to its customers. However, except as expressly set forth herein, eGain shall not be responsible for any delays, errors, failures to perform, or disruptions in the Hosting Services caused by or resulting from any act, omission or condition beyond eGain's reasonable control.\n\n7. Limitation of liability. EXCLUDING LIABILITY FOR INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS AS DISCUSSED IN SECTION 9 OF THIS AGREEMENT, IN NO EVENT SHALL eGAIN BE LIABLE TO CUSTOMER FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INDIRECT, SPECIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOST PROFITS), OR BE LIABLE TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, EVEN IF eGAIN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. eGain's entire liability under this Agreement for any damages from any cause whatsoever, regardless of form or action, whether in contract, negligence or otherwise, shall in no event exceed an amount equal to the price paid for the Services out of which the claim arose.\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Confidential Information. Each party agrees to keep confidential and to use only for purposes of performing (or as otherwise permitted under) this Agreement, any proprietary or confidential information of the other party disclosed pursuant to this Agreement which is marked as confidential or which would reasonably be considered of a confidential nature. The obligation of confidentiality shall not apply to information which is publicly available through authorized disclosure, is known by the receiving party at the time of disclosure as evidenced in writing, is rightfully obtained from a third party who has the right to disclose it, or which is required by law, government order or request to be disclosed. Upon any termination of this Agreement, each party shall return to the other party all confidential information of the other party, and all copies thereof, in the possession, custody or control of the party unless otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement.\n\n9. Indemnification. Subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 9, eGain will defend any third-party suit or action against Customer to the extent such suit or action is based on a claim that the Software or the eGain System infringes any valid United States patent, copyright, trade secret or other proprietary right, and eGain will pay those damages and costs finally awarded against Customer in any monetary settlement of such suit or action which are specifically attributable to such claim. These obligations do not include any claims to the extent they are based on use of the Software or eGain System in violation of this Agreement or in combination with any other software or hardware, or any modification to the Software or eGain System pursuant to Customer's specifications. If any portion of the Software or eGain System becomes, or in eGain's opinion is likely to become, the subject of a claim of infringement, then eGain may, at its option and expense, (a) procure for Customer the right to continue using such Software or the eGain System, or (b) replace or modify the Software or the eGain System so that it becomes non-infringing. The indemnity obligations set forth in this Section 9 are contingent upon: (i) Customer giving prompt written notice to the eGain of any such claim(s); (ii) eGain having sole control of the defense or settlement of the claim; and (iii) at eGain's request and expense, Customer cooperating in the investigation and defense of such claim(s). THE FOREGOING STATES eGAIN'S ENTIRE LIABILITY FOR INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS.\n\n10. Term and Termination.\n\n10.1 Term and Termination. This Agreement shall continue in effect from the Effective Date for a one (1) year period, unless earlier terminated as set forth below, and thereafter shall renew automatically for successive one (1) year periods unless either party gives the other party at least thirty (30) days prior written notice of its intent not to renew the Agreement. In addition, either party may terminate this Agreement by giving to the other party written notice\n\neGAIN COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION\n\nHOSTING AGREEMENT\n\nof such termination upon the other party's material breach of any material term (subject to the other party's right to cure within thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice), the other party's insolvency, or the institution of any bankruptcy or similar proceedings by or against the other party.\n\n10.2 Effect of Termination. Upon any termination of this Agreement, eGain shall immediately cease providing all Hosting Services, and Customer shall no longer have access to the Software or the eGain System. Except in the event of termination for Customer's breach, eGain shall provide Customer with an electronic copy of the final Reports (covering the month just prior to termination of this Agreement). eGain shall be entitled to retain a copy (whether electronic or otherwise) of the Online Messages and the Reports for its records and internal purposes and shall not disclose such Online Messages or Reports to any third party except as permitted under Section 4. Within fifteen (15) days of any termination of this Agreement, Customer shall pay to eGain all unpaid fees accrued prior to termination. Sections 4, 5 (as to amounts accrued but unpaid), 7, 8, 10.2 and 12 and Exhibit A (as to amounts accrued but unpaid) shall survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement.\n\n11. Customer References. Customer agrees that, during the term of this Agreement, eGain may reference Customer in eGain's customer listings and may place Customer's name and logo on eGain's Web site and in collateral marketing materials relating to eGain's products and services. Customer hereby grants eGain a right to use Customer's trademarks (name and logo only) designated by Customer for such limited uses, subject to Customer's trademark/logo usage guidelines, if any, provided by Customer to eGain. With these limited exceptions, eGain agrees that it may not use Customer's name, logo or any other trademarks (including in any press releases, customer \"case studies,\" and the like) without Customer's prior consent.\n\n12. Miscellaneous. This Agreement, including Exhibit A and any other exhibits hereto, constitutes the entire agreement of the parties, and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous agreements between the parties, with respect to the subject of this Agreement. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, this Agreement may be modified only by a writing signed by an authorized representative of each party. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California exclusive of its conflict of laws principles. Notices under this Agreement shall be in writing, addressed to the party at its last-provided address, and shall be deemed given when delivered personally, or by e-mail (with confirmation of receipt) or conventional mail (registered or certified, postage prepaid with return receipt requested). Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended or is to be construed to constitute eGain and Customer as partners or joint venturers or\n\n\n\n\n\neither party as an agent of the other. If any provision of this Agreement shall be declared invalid, illegal or unenforceable, all remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect. All waivers of any rights or breach hereunder must be in writing to be effective, and no failure to enforce any right or provision shall be deemed to be a waiver of the same or other right or provision on that or any other occasion. Neither party may assign or otherwise transfer its rights and/or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no consent shall be required for an assignment of this Agreement made pursuant to a merger, consolidation, or the acquisition of all or substantially all of the business and assets of a party. This Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties and their successors and permitted assigns.\n\nEach party agrees to the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement.\n\nCustomer: Eliance Corporation\n\nName:/s/                                 Title:                              ___________________________               _________\n\nSignature:______________________         Date:__________\n\neGain Communications Corporation:\n\nName:/s/                                 Title:                              ___________________________               _________\n\nSignature:______________________         Date:__________"

The Hosting Services, and the hosting fees specified in Exhibit A, do not include any deployment, training or other consulting or professional services which, if applicable, will be specified in a Statement of Work, signed by both parties, and incorporated herein by this reference.\n\n2.1 Customer Support. eGain will provide live telephone support to Customer 24-hours-a-day, seven-days-a-week by a trained eGain customer support representative.\n\n3. Customer's Responsibilities. Customer agrees that it shall be responsible for providing and maintaining its own Internet access and all necessary telecommunications equipment, software and other materials (\"Customer Equipment\") at Customer's location necessary for accessing the Software and the eGain System through the Internet. Customer agrees to notify eGain of any changes in the Customer Equipment, including any system configuration changes or any hardware or software upgrades, which may affect the Hosting Services provided hereunder. The eGain System is only to be used for lawful purposes. Customer agrees not to transmit, re-transmit or store materials on or through the eGain System or the Software that are harmful to the eGain System or Software, or in violation of any applicable laws or regulations, including without limitation laws relating to infringement of intellectual property and proprietary rights of others. To the extent that certain components of the Software may be downloaded to Customer's or User's computer as a result of accessing the Software as part of the Hosting Services, eGain grants Customers a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license, with right to sublicense solely to Users, to use such Software only in connection with the Hosting Services. Neither Customer nor Users are otherwise permitted to use the Software, nor will Customer or Users disassemble, decompile or otherwise attempt to discern the source code of such Software. Customer agrees that, except as expressly set forth in this Section and in Section 11, it will not rent, lease, sublicense, re-sell, time-share or otherwise assign to any third party this Agreement or any of Customer's rights or licenses to access the Software or the eGain System, nor shall Customer use, or authorize others to use, the Software, Hosting Services or the eGain System to operate a service bureau. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, Customer shall be permitted to provide access to the eGain System to its employees and agents located worldwide.\n\n4. Proprietary Rights. Except for the limited access right granted to Customer in this Agreement, all right, title and interest in and to the Software (including any and all modifications as a result of any implementation services rendered) and the eGain System are and shall remain the exclusive property of eGain and its licensors. eGain acknowledges and agrees that the Online Messages are the property of Customer and that eGain has only a limited right to use the Online Messages as set forth in the following sentence. Notwithstanding the foregoing, eGain may access and disclose the Online Messages solely as necessary to provide the Hosting Services, to operate and maintain its systems, to comply with applicable laws and government orders and requests, and to protect itself and its customers.\n\n5. Pricing and Payment. Customer agrees to pay the fees and other charges for the Hosting Services and other services provided under this Agreement as specified in Exhibit A of this Agreement. CUSTOMER AGREES TO PAY FOR HOSTING SERVICES ON OR BEFORE THE FIRST DAY OF THE MONTH IN WHICH THE HOSTING SERVICES ARE PROVIDED, except that, with respect to Additional Fees (as defined in Exhibit A), eGain will invoice Customer for such Fees in the month after the month in which such fees accrue as provided in Exhibit A. All amounts payable hereunder are exclusive of any and all taxes, and Customer is responsible for payment of such taxes (excluding taxes based on eGain's net income). All prices are stated, and Customer shall pay, in United States dollars. Payment received by eGain after the due date shall be subject to a late fee equal to one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month, or, if less, the maximum amount allowed by applicable law. At the end of the initial one-year term of this Agreement and any subsequent one-year terms, eGain may adjust the monthly fee payable under this Agreement by providing Customer written notice of such adjustment at least sixty (60) days prior to the beginning of the new term.\n\n6. Limited Warranties; Disclaimer of Warranties.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1 eGain warrants and represents to Customer that (i) the Software will perform substantially in accordance with the documentation, if any, provided by eGain to Customer, and (ii) the Hosting Services will be performed in a professional and workmanlike manner and in accordance with Section 2. In the event of Downtime (as defined in this Section 6.1 below), as Customer's sole and exclusive remedy and eGain's sole and exclusive liability, the monthly fee payable for the Hosting Services shall be reduced as follows:\n\na) For the first sixty (60) minutes of Downtime during Normal Business       Hours or the first four (4) hours of Downtime outside of Normal Business       Hours (\"Initial Downtime\"), eGain will credit Customer's account for one       (1) day of service.\n\nb) For each eight (8) hour period of Downtime per day in addition to the       Initial Downtime, eGain will credit Customer's account for one (1)       additional day of service.\n\nFor the purposes of this Agreement, \"Downtime\" shall mean any interruption in the availability of Hosting Services to Customer (excluding scheduled interruptions of which Customer is notified 48 hours in advanced), only if such interruption is due either to: 1) an error in the Software, or 2) failure of the eGain System (but not including problems associated with Internet connectivity). Downtime begins upon Customer notification to eGain of the interruption, either\n\neGAIN COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION\n\nHOSTING AGREEMENT\n\nby speaking directly with an eGain customer service representative or recording a voice mail message in the eGain customer service voice mail box, and continues until the availability of the Hosting Services is restored to the Customer. For purposes of this Agreement, \"Normal Business Hours\" shall mean between the hours of 6:00 a.m to 6:00 p.m. Pacific time, Monday through Friday excluding national holidays.\n\nIn the event of a breach (other than Downtime) of the warranty set forth in Section 6.1(i) above, Customer's sole and exclusive remedy, and eGain's sole and exclusive liability shall be, at eGain's option, repair or replacement of the Software.\n\nTHE FOREGOING CONSTITUTES CUSTOMER'S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY, AND eGAIN'S ENTIRE LIABILITY, FOR DOWNTIME AND FOR BREACH OF THE HOSTING SERVICES WARRANTY PROVIDED IN THIS SECTION 6.1.\n\n6.2 eGain represents and warrants that, prior to, during and after the calendar year 2000 A.D., the Software and the eGain System will process, calculate, manipulate, sort, store and transfer date data without material error or material performance degradation, including without limitation date data which represents or references different centuries or more than one century (such representation and warranty being referred to as \"Year 2000 Compliant\"). In the event that the Software or eGain System is not Year 2000 Compliant, Customer's sole and exclusive remedy and eGain's sole and exclusive liability shall be for eGain, at no additional cost to Customer, to promptly modify the Software or the eGain System so that the Software or eGain System is Year 2000 Compliant. The foregoing warranty is conditioned upon the Customer using the Software and/or the eGain System in accordance with its applicable Documentation, and on other software, hardware, network and systems (other than the Software and the eGain System) with which the Software and/or the eGain System interface or interoperate also being Year 2000 Compliant.\n\n6.3 EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SECTIONS 6.1-6.2, (A) THE HOSTING SERVICES ARE PROVIDED, AND THE SOFTWARE AND THE eGAIN SYSTEM ARE MADE AVAILABLE, BY eGAIN TO CUSTOMER \"AS IS,\" AND (B) eGAIN AND ITS SUPPLIERS MAKE NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, REGARDING THE HOSTING SERVICES, THE SOFTWARE OR THE eGAIN SYSTEM, AND SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND AGAINST INFRINGEMENT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT POSSIBLE BY LAW.\n\n6.4 Without limiting the express warranties set forth in this Agreement, eGain does not warrant that the Software, the eGain System or the Hosting Services will meet Customer's requirements (except as provided in Section 6.1) or that Customer's access to and use of the Software, the eGain System or the Hosting Services will be uninterrupted or free of errors or omissions. eGain cannot and does not guarantee the privacy, security, authenticity and non-corruption of any information transmitted through, or stored in any system connected to, the Internet. eGain will use commercially reasonable efforts to adequately maintain, and upgrade as necessary, the eGain System to provide the Hosting Services to its customers. However, except as expressly set forth herein, eGain shall not be responsible for any delays, errors, failures to perform, or disruptions in the Hosting Services caused by or resulting from any act, omission or condition beyond eGain's reasonable control.\n\n7. Limitation of liability. EXCLUDING LIABILITY FOR INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS AS DISCUSSED IN SECTION 9 OF THIS AGREEMENT, IN NO EVENT SHALL eGAIN BE LIABLE TO CUSTOMER FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INDIRECT, SPECIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOST PROFITS), OR BE LIABLE TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, EVEN IF eGAIN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. eGain's entire liability under this Agreement for any damages from any cause whatsoever, regardless of form or action, whether in contract, negligence or otherwise, shall in no event exceed an amount equal to the price paid for the Services out of which the claim arose.\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Confidential Information. Each party agrees to keep confidential and to use only for purposes of performing (or as otherwise permitted under) this Agreement, any proprietary or confidential information of the other party disclosed pursuant to this Agreement which is marked as confidential or which would reasonably be considered of a confidential nature. The obligation of confidentiality shall not apply to information which is publicly available through authorized disclosure, is known by the receiving party at the time of disclosure as evidenced in writing, is rightfully obtained from a third party who has the right to disclose it, or which is required by law, government order or request to be disclosed. Upon any termination of this Agreement, each party shall return to the other party all confidential information of the other party, and all copies thereof, in the possession, custody or control of the party unless otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement.\n\n9. Indemnification. Subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 9, eGain will defend any third-party suit or action against Customer to the extent such suit or action is based on a claim that the Software or the eGain System infringes any valid United States patent, copyright, trade secret or other proprietary right, and eGain will pay those damages and costs finally awarded against Customer in any monetary settlement of such suit or action which are specifically attributable to such claim. These obligations do not include any claims to the extent they are based on use of the Software or eGain System in violation of this Agreement or in combination with any other software or hardware, or any modification to the Software or eGain System pursuant to Customer's specifications. If any portion of the Software or eGain System becomes, or in eGain's opinion is likely to become, the subject of a claim of infringement, then eGain may, at its option and expense, (a) procure for Customer the right to continue using such Software or the eGain System, or (b) replace or modify the Software or the eGain System so that it becomes non-infringing. The indemnity obligations set forth in this Section 9 are contingent upon: (i) Customer giving prompt written notice to the eGain of any such claim(s); (ii) eGain having sole control of the defense or settlement of the claim; and (iii) at eGain's request and expense, Customer cooperating in the investigation and defense of such claim(s). THE FOREGOING STATES eGAIN'S ENTIRE LIABILITY FOR INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS.\n\n10. Term and Termination.\n\n10.1 Term and Termination. This Agreement shall continue in effect from the Effective Date for a one (1) year period, unless earlier terminated as set forth below, and thereafter shall renew automatically for successive one (1) year periods unless either party gives the other party at least thirty (30) days prior written notice of its intent not to renew the Agreement. In addition, either party may terminate this Agreement by giving to the other party written notice\n\neGAIN COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION\n\nHOSTING AGREEMENT\n\nof such termination upon the other party's material breach of any material term (subject to the other party's right to cure within thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice), the other party's insolvency, or the institution of any bankruptcy or similar proceedings by or against the other party.\n\n10.2 Effect of Termination. Upon any termination of this Agreement, eGain shall immediately cease providing all Hosting Services, and Customer shall no longer have access to the Software or the eGain System. Except in the event of termination for Customer's breach, eGain shall provide Customer with an electronic copy of the final Reports (covering the month just prior to termination of this Agreement). eGain shall be entitled to retain a copy (whether electronic or otherwise) of the Online Messages and the Reports for its records and internal purposes and shall not disclose such Online Messages or Reports to any third party except as permitted under Section 4. Within fifteen (15) days of any termination of this Agreement, Customer shall pay to eGain all unpaid fees accrued prior to termination. Sections 4, 5 (as to amounts accrued but unpaid), 7, 8, 10.2 and 12 and Exhibit A (as to amounts accrued but unpaid) shall survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement.\n\n11. Customer References. Customer agrees that, during the term of this Agreement, eGain may reference Customer in eGain's customer listings and may place Customer's name and logo on eGain's Web site and in collateral marketing materials relating to eGain's products and services. Customer hereby grants eGain a right to use Customer's trademarks (name and logo only) designated by Customer for such limited uses, subject to Customer's trademark/logo usage guidelines, if any, provided by Customer to eGain. With these limited exceptions, eGain agrees that it may not use Customer's name, logo or any other trademarks (including in any press releases, customer \"case studies,\" and the like) without Customer's prior consent.\n\n12. Miscellaneous. This Agreement, including Exhibit A and any other exhibits hereto, constitutes the entire agreement of the parties, and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous agreements between the parties, with respect to the subject of this Agreement. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, this Agreement may be modified only by a writing signed by an authorized representative of each party. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California exclusive of its conflict of laws principles. Notices under this Agreement shall be in writing, addressed to the party at its last-provided address, and shall be deemed given when delivered personally, or by e-mail (with confirmation of receipt) or conventional mail (registered or certified, postage prepaid with return receipt requested). Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended or is to be construed to constitute eGain and Customer as partners or joint venturers or\n\n\n\n\n\neither party as an agent of the other. If any provision of this Agreement shall be declared invalid, illegal or unenforceable, all remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect. All waivers of any rights or breach hereunder must be in writing to be effective, and no failure to enforce any right or provision shall be deemed to be a waiver of the same or other right or provision on that or any other occasion. Neither party may assign or otherwise transfer its rights and/or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no consent shall be required for an assignment of this Agreement made pursuant to a merger, consolidation, or the acquisition of all or substantially all of the business and assets of a party. This Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties and their successors and permitted assigns.\n\nEach party agrees to the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement.\n\nCustomer: Eliance Corporation\n\nName:/s/                                 Title:                              ___________________________               _________\n\nSignature:______________________         Date:__________\n\neGain Communications Corporation:\n\nName:/s/                                 Title:                              ___________________________               _________\n\nSignature:______________________         Date:__________"

      "response": "The date of the contract is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the information given, we can infer the following:\n\n1. The agreement is referred to as the \"Hosting Agreement\" between eGain Communications Corporation and Eliance Corporation.\n\n2. There is no specific \"Effective Date\" mentioned in the contract text.\n\n3. The contract specifies that the initial term is for a period of one (1) year, and it will automatically renew for successive one-year periods unless either party provides 30 days' written notice of non-renewal.\n\nTherefore, without a stated effective date, the date of the contract cannot be determined from the information provided.
