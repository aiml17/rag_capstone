      "William Randolph Hearst Sr. ( ; April 29, 1863 – August 14, 1951) was an American businessman, politician, and newspaper publisher who built the nation's largest newspaper chain and media company Hearst Communications and whose flamboyant methods of yellow journalism influenced the nation's popular media by emphasizing sensationalism and human interest stories. Hearst entered the publishing business in 1887 after being given control of \"The San Francisco Examiner\" by his wealthy father. Moving to New York City, he acquired \"The New York Journal\" and fought a bitter circulation war with Joseph Pulitzer's \"New York World\" that sold papers by giant headlines over lurid stories featuring crime, corruption, graphics, sex, and innuendo. Acquiring more newspapers, Hearst created a chain that numbered nearly thirty papers in major American cities at its peak.
