      " The Bed Rail Tie Down system allows you to properly secure cargo in the truck bed.  Bed Rail Tie Down Locations Your vehicle is equipped with the child restraint anchorage system called LATCH, which stands for Lower Anchors and Tethers for CHildren.  The LATCH system has three vehicle anchor points for installing LATCH-equipped child seats.  There are two lower anchorages located at the back of the seat cushion where it meets the seatback and one top tether anchorage located behind the seating position.  These anchorages are used to install LATCH-equipped child seats without using the vehicle’s seat belts.  Some seating positions may have a top tether anchorage but no lower anchorages.  In these seating positions, the seat belt must be used with the top tether anchorage to install the child restraint.  Please see the following table for more information.  The TSC is a telescoping link that can be installed between the hitch receiver and the trailer tongue.  It typically provides adjustable friction associated with the telescoping motion to dampen any unwanted trailer swaying motions while traveling.  Supplemental Seat-Mounted Side Air Bags (SABs) are located in the outboard side of the front seats.  The SABs are marked with a “SRS AIRBAG” or “AIRBAG” on a label or on the seat trim on the outboard side of the seats.  Four auxiliary switches are located in the lower switch bank of the instrument panel and can be used to power various electrical devices.  1 — Retainers 2 — Fuel Filter Protective Cover The fold-down windshield on your vehicle is a structural element that can provide protection in some accidents.  The windshield also provides protection against weather, road debris and intrusion of small branches and other objects.",
      " Weight-Distributing Hitch A Weight-Distributing Hitch system works by applying leverage through spring (load) bars.  They are typically used for heavier loads to distribute trailer tongue weight to the tow vehicle's front axle and the trailer axle(s).  When used in accordance with the manufacturer's directions, it provides for a more level ride, offering more consistent steering and brake control thereby enhancing towing safety.  The addition of a friction/hydraulic sway control also dampens sway caused by traffic and crosswinds and contributes positively to tow vehicle and trailer stability.  Trailer sway control and a Weight-Distributing (load equalizing) Hitch are recommended for heavier Tongue Weights (TW) and may be required depending on vehicle and trailer configuration/loading to comply with Gross Axle Weight Rating (GAWR) requirements.  WARNING: An improperly adjusted Weight-Distributing Hitch system may reduce handling, stability, braking performance, and could result in a collision.  Weight-Distributing Hitch systems may not be compatible with surge brake couplers.  Consult with your hitch and trailer manufacturer or a reputable Recreational Vehicle dealer for additional information.",
      " BED RAIL TIE DOWN SYSTEM — IF EQUIPPED The Bed Rail Tie Down system allows you to properly secure cargo in the truck bed.  There are two adjustable utility rail cleats on each side of the bed that can be used to assist in securing cargo.  Each utility rail cleat must be tightened down in one of the detents along either utility rail in order to keep cargo properly secured.  To move the utility rail cleat to any position on the utility rail, turn the cleat retainer nut counterclockwise several times.  Then, pull out on the utility rail cleat and slide it to the detent nearest the desired location.  Make sure the utility rail cleat is seated in the detent, and tighten the nut.  To remove the utility rail cleats from the side utility rails, slide the cleat to the rectangular cutout located at the end of the rail toward the front of the vehicle.  To remove the utility rail cleat from the front utility rail, slide the cleat to the rectangular cutout located on the left side of the rail.  CAUTION: The maximum load per cleat should not exceed 250 lb (113 kg) and the angle of the load on each cleat should not exceed 45 degrees above horizontal, or damage to the cleat or cleat rail may occur.

      " Brake Warning Light This warning light monitors various brake functions, including brake fluid level and parking brake application.  If the brake light turns on it may indicate that the parking brake is applied, that the brake fluid level is low, or that there is a problem with the Anti-Lock Brake System reservoir.  If the light remains on when the parking brake has been disengaged, and the fluid level is at the full mark on the master cylinder reservoir, it indicates a possible brake hydraulic system malfunction or that a problem with the Brake Booster has been detected by the Anti-Lock Brake System (ABS) / Electronic Stability Control (ESC) system.  In this case, the light will remain on until the condition has been corrected.  If the problem is related to the brake booster, the ABS pump will run when applying the brake, and a brake pedal pulsation may be felt during each stop.  The dual brake system provides a reserve braking capacity in the event of a failure to a portion of the hydraulic system.  A leak in either half of the dual brake system is indicated by the Brake Warning Light, which will turn on when the brake fluid level in the master cylinder has dropped below a specified level.  The light will remain on until the cause is corrected.  If brake failure is indicated, immediate repair is necessary.  Vehicles equipped with the Anti-Lock Brake System (ABS) are also equipped with Electronic Brake Force Distribution (EBD).  In the event of an EBD failure, the Brake Warning Light will turn on along with the ABS Light.  Immediate repair to the ABS system is required.  Operation of the Brake Warning Light can be checked by turning the ignition switch from the OFF position to the ON/RUN position.  The light should illuminate for approximately two seconds.  The light should then turn off unless the parking brake is applied or a brake fault is detected.  If the light does not illuminate, have the light inspected by an authorized dealer.  The light also will turn on when the parking brake is applied with the ignition switch in the ON/RUN position.  Note: The light may flash momentarily during sharp cornering maneuvers, which change fluid level conditions.  The vehicle should have service performed, and the brake fluid level checked.  WARNING: Driving a vehicle with the red brake light on is dangerous.  Part of the brake system may have failed.  It will take longer to stop the vehicle.  You could have a collision.  Have the vehicle checked immediately.  Note: This light shows only that the parking brake is applied.  It does not show the degree of brake application.",

        " Brake Warning Light This warning light monitors various brake functions, including brake fluid level and parking brake application.  If the brake light turns on it may indicate that the parking brake is applied, that the brake fluid level is low, or that there is a problem with the Anti-Lock Brake System reservoir.  If the light remains on when the parking brake has been disengaged, and the fluid level is at the full mark on the master cylinder reservoir, it indicates a possible brake hydraulic system malfunction or that a problem with the Brake Booster has been detected by the Anti-Lock Brake System (ABS) / Electronic Stability Control (ESC) system.  In this case, the light will remain on until the condition has been corrected.  If the problem is related to the brake booster, the ABS pump will run when applying the brake, and a brake pedal pulsation may be felt during each stop.  The dual brake system provides a reserve braking capacity in the event of a failure to a portion of the hydraulic system.  A leak in either half of the dual brake system is indicated by the Brake Warning Light, which will turn on when the brake fluid level in the master cylinder has dropped below a specified level.  The light will remain on until the cause is corrected.  If brake failure is indicated, immediate repair is necessary.  Vehicles equipped with the Anti-Lock Brake System (ABS) are also equipped with Electronic Brake Force Distribution (EBD).  In the event of an EBD failure, the Brake Warning Light will turn on along with the ABS Light.  Immediate repair to the ABS system is required.  Operation of the Brake Warning Light can be checked by turning the ignition switch from the OFF position to the ON/RUN position.  The light should illuminate for approximately two seconds.  The light should then turn off unless the parking brake is applied or a brake fault is detected.  If the light does not illuminate, have the light inspected by an authorized dealer.  The light also will turn on when the parking brake is applied with the ignition switch in the ON/RUN position.  Note: The light may flash momentarily during sharp cornering maneuvers, which change fluid level conditions.  The vehicle should have service performed, and the brake fluid level checked.  WARNING: Driving a vehicle with the red brake light on is dangerous.  Part of the brake system may have failed.  It will take longer to stop the vehicle.  You could have a collision.  Have the vehicle checked immediately.  Note: This light shows only that the parking brake is applied.  It does not show the degree of brake application.  Brake System Warning Light The red Brake System Warning Light will turn on when the ignition is placed in the ON/RUN mode, and may stay on for as long as four seconds.  If the Brake System Warning Light remains on or comes on while driving, it indicates that the brake system is not functioning properly and that immediate service is required.  If the Brake System Warning Light does not come on when the ignition is placed in the ON/RUN mode, have the light repaired as soon as possible.  Anti-Lock Brake System (ABS) Warning Light The yellow ABS Warning Light will turn on when the ignition is placed in the ON/RUN mode and may stay on for as long as four seconds.  If the ABS Warning Light remains on or comes on while driving, it indicates that the anti-lock portion of the brake system is not functioning and that service is required.  However, the conventional brake system will continue to operate normally if the ABS Warning Light is on.  If the ABS Warning Light is on, the brake system should be serviced as soon as possible to restore the benefits of Anti-Lock Brakes.  If the ABS Warning Light does not come on when the ignition is placed in the ON/RUN mode, have the light repaired as soon as possible.",

Frequency Operated Button Integrated Key (FOBIK-Safe) To minimize the possibility of unintentionally locking a Passive Entry key fob inside your vehicle, the Passive Entry system is equipped with an automatic door unlock feature which will function only if the ignition switch is in the OFF position.  FOBIK-Safe only executes in vehicles with Passive Entry.  There are three situations that trigger a FOBIK-Safe search in any Passive Entry vehicle: A lock request is made by a valid Passive Entry key fob while a door is open.  A lock request is made by the Passive Entry door handle while a door is open.  A lock request is made by the door panel switch while the door is open.  When any of these situations occur, after all open doors are closed, the FOBIK-Safe search will be executed.  If it detects a Passive Entry key fob inside the vehicle, the vehicle will unlock and alert the customer.  If Passive Entry is disabled using the Uconnect system, the key fob protection described in this section remains active/functional.  Note: The vehicle will only unlock the doors during a FOBIK-Safe operation when a valid Passive Entry key fob is detected inside the vehicle.  The vehicle will not unlock the doors when any of the following conditions are true: A second valid Passive Entry key fob is detected outside of the vehicle (within 5 ft (1.5 m) of a Passive Entry door handle).  The doors are manually locked using the door lock knobs.  Three attempts are made to lock the doors using the door panel switch, and then the doors are closed.  To Lock The Vehicle’s Doors With one of the vehicle’s Passive Entry key fobs within 5 ft (1.5 m) of the driver or passenger front door handles, pushing the Passive Entry lock button will lock the vehicle doors.  Note: When pushing the door handle lock button, DO NOT grab the door handle.  This could unlock the door(s).  Note: After pushing the door handle button, the driver must wait three seconds before locking or unlocking the doors, using any Passive Entry door handle.  This is done to allow the driver to check if the vehicle is locked by pulling the door handle without the vehicle unlocking.  If Passive Entry is disabled using the Uconnect system, the key fob protection described in “Preventing Inadvertent Locking Of Passive Entry Key Fob In Vehicle” remains active/functional.  The Passive Entry system will not operate if the key fob battery is depleted",
