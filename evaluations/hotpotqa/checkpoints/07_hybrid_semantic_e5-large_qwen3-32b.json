The question is asking who the new permanent member on the fourteenth season of So You Think You Can Dance played in High School Musical.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the context provided.

The judge panel includes Nigel Lythgoe, Mary Murphy, and a new permanent member, Vanessa Hudgens. Cat Deeley is the host.\n\nThen, there's information about Vanessa Hudgens. It says she has a discography that includes songs from High School Musical, where she played Gabriella Montez. The context also states that after her role in \"Thirteen,\" she rose to prominence as Gabriella Montez in the High School Musical series.\n\nSo the new permanent judge in season 14 is Vanessa Hudgens, and in High School Musical, she played Gabriella Montez.

The question is asking for the name of a Minahasa journalist and novelist who was active in the colonies that were incorporated into the Dutch government in 1800. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the context provided. The first paragraph mentions Pangemanann (also spelled Pangemanan), who was a Minahasa journalist and novelist active in the Dutch East Indies. The Dutch East Indies became a Dutch colony under the government in 1800, formed from the Dutch East India Company's colonies.\n\nSo the key points here are: Minahasa, journalist, novelist, active in the Dutch East Indies (which became part of the Dutch government in 1800). The name given in the context is Pangemanann. The answer should be that person's name. The other information about the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency and plug-in electric vehicles seems unrelated to the question, so I can ignore that. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other name mentioned. Let me check again. The context only mentions Pangemanann/Pangemanan. The rest is about the Dutch East Indies and other Dutch government agencies, but those are not relevant here. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be Pangemanann. The question is straightforward once connecting the Minahasa journalist to the Dutch East Indies colony established in 1800.\n</think>\n\nThe Minahasa journalist and novelist active in the Dutch East Indies, which was incorporated into the Dutch government in 1800, is **Pangemanann** (also spelled Pangemanan).",

Wait, the question asks for the city. Let me think again. The context says \"at Fordham University from 1979 to 1980.\" Fordham University's main campus is in The Bronx, New York City. So the city would be New York City. But sometimes people might refer to the specific borough. However, the question just asks for the city. So the answer should be New York City.

The question is asking about the youngest male model ever to participate in Seoul Fashion Week, who stars with Park Hae-jin and Kang So-ra in a TV series, and we need to find out the date it last aired.\n\nFirst, looking at the context provided. The first sentence says, \"He debuted in 2005 as a runway model, becoming the youngest male model ever to participate in Seoul Fashion Week.\" So that's our starting point. The person in question here is the one who was the youngest male model at Seoul Fashion Week.\n\nThen, the next sentence mentions \"Doctor Stranger ( ) is a 2014 South Korean television series starring Lee Jong-suk, Jin Se-yeon, Park Hae-jin and Kang So-ra.\" Wait, the question mentions Park Hae-jin and Kang So-ra, who are part of the cast of Doctor Stranger. So the actor we're looking for is part of this cast. The main actors here are Lee Jong-suk, Jin Se-yeon, Park Hae-jin, and Kang So-ra. The question says the model stars with Park Hae-jin and Kang So-ra, so the actor in question here is probably Lee Jong-suk, since he's the main lead. But let's check the other parts of the context to confirm.\n\nThe next part talks about another model: \"He started as a fashion model in 1990 and been a male model in China for over 20 years. He won the 'Top Chinese Male Model' title in 1991 and was the first Chinese male model to walk the international fashion runway.\" Then it mentions Hu transitioning to TV in 1996 and becoming famous with \"Love Talks\" in 1999. But this seems to be about a different person, possibly Hu, maybe Hu Ge? But that's not relevant to the first part about Seoul Fashion Week.\n\nSo going back, the first part mentions someone who debuted in 2005 as a runway model, becoming the youngest in Seoul Fashion Week.

The question is asking who will conduct the firing cannons in Victoria as part of a musical piece written to celebrate the defeat of Napoleon in Russia. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the context provided. The context mentions three musical pieces: The Year 1812 Overture by Tchaikovsky, Victoria Symphony Splash event, and 110, BB 115 by Bart\u00f3k. The 1812 Overture is specifically about commemorating Russia's defense against Napoleon. The Victoria Symphony Splash is an event where the symphony plays live on a barge. The 2016 event was the 27th, and the conductor is Tania Miller.\n\nThe question mentions cannons being fired as part of a musical piece celebrating Napoleon's defeat. The 1812 Overture is known for including cannon fire during its performance, especially in outdoor events. Since the Victoria Symphony Splash is an event that includes the symphony playing, and the 1812 Overture is part of their repertoire (since it's a popular piece for such events), the cannons would be part of that performance. The conductor of the Victoria Symphony is Tania Miller, so she would be leading the performance, including the cannon fire. \n\nI need to check if the context directly links the 1812 Overture to the Victoria Symphony Splash. The context doesn't explicitly say that the 1812 Overture is part of the Splash event, but since the question is about a musical piece celebrating Napoleon's defeat, which is the 1812 Overture, and the event in Victoria is the Symphony Splash conducted by Tania Miller, it's logical to infer that she would conduct that piece with cannons. Therefore, the answer is Tania Miller.\n</think>\n\nThe musical piece celebrating the defeat of Napoleon in Russia is Tchaikovsky's *1812 Overture*, which is famously associated with cannon fire during performances.

His first novel is \"Call for the Dead\" from 1961, and he's known for works like \"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold.\" So definitely, he's a novelist.\n\nNow, Tim Winton.

The question is asking which former American football player had a part in the movie \"Gamer.\" The context provided mentions a few people.\n\nFirst, there's Terry Alan Crews, born in 1968, who is an actor, artist, and former American football player. Then there's Jerry LeVias, born 1946, a former football player. Ainsley Thomas Battles, born 1978, also a former football player. The movie \"Gamer\" is from 2009.\n\nI need to figure out which of these three former players was in the movie. The context doesn't directly say which one, but maybe there's a clue. Terry Crews is mentioned as an actor, which is relevant because the movie is an acting role. The other two, Jerry LeVias and Ainsley Battles, aren't mentioned as actors. The fact that Terry Crews is listed as an actor in the context suggests he might be the one. Also, considering that \"Gamer\" is a 2009 film, Terry Crews was active in acting around that time.

The user is asking which player \"O Fen\u00f4meno\" is responsible for popularizing a soccer move that was first reported to be used by another player.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the context provided. The context mentions the step over move, also called the pedalada, den\u00edlson, or scissors. It says that the step over was first used in Europe by Dutch player Law Adam, who was famous for it in the late 1920s/early 1930s, earning the nickname \"Adam the Scissorsman.\" Later, in Italy, Amedeo Biavati used it in the 1930s.

The most well-known player with that nickname is Ronaldo, specifically Ronaldo Naz\u00e1rio, who was a key player in the late 90s and early 2000s. He was known for his dribbling and use of the step over. So, the move was first used by Law Adam, then Biavati, but Ronaldo popularized it. The question is about who first used it before Ronaldo. The answer should be Law Adam, as he's mentioned as the first in Europe. The context also says that the move was first reported in scientific literature in 1955, but that part might be a distractor since it's about AAS (which I think refers to anabolic-androgenic steroids, but that's unrelated to the soccer move question). The key part is the first paragraph: Law Adam first used it in Europe, then Biavati in Italy, and later Ronaldo made it famous.

The user is asking whether both Life magazine and Strictly Slots magazine were published monthly in 1998. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the context provided. Let me start by recalling the details about Life magazine. The context says that Life was published weekly until 1972, then as an intermittent \"special\" until 1978, and as a monthly from 1978 to 2000. So, from 1978 to 2000, Life was a monthly publication. Since 1998 falls within that range (1978-2000), Life was indeed a monthly magazine in 1998.\n\nNow, for Strictly Slots. The context states that Strictly Slots is a monthly magazine aimed at slot machine and video poker players. It was founded in 1998. Since it's described as a monthly magazine and was founded in 1998, that means in 1998, the first year of its publication, it was published monthly.

The question is asking for the population of a county as of the 2010 census, which was named after the 13th Speaker of the House of Representatives.\n\nFirst, I need to identify who the 13th Speaker of the House was. Looking at the context provided, there's a mention of someone who \"previously served as the 13th Speaker of the House of Representatives and as Governor of Tennessee.\" Wait, but then there's also information about Thomas Stephen Foley being the 49th Speaker.

Wait, the county was named after \"then-governor (and future president) James K.\" So that's James K. Polk. But the question is about the county named after the 13th Speaker of the House.

For example, Henry Clay was a Speaker, but I'm not sure about the exact number. Alternatively, maybe the person mentioned here is someone else.

Let me check their lifespans based on the context provided.\n\nFirst, Edward Franklin Albee III was born on March 12, 1928, and died on September 16, 2016. To calculate his age, I subtract the birth year from the death year: 2016 minus 1928. That gives 88 years. But since his birthday is in March and he died in September, he would have turned 88 in March 2016, so he lived 88 years.\n\nNow, J.M. Barrie, whose full name is Sir James Matthew Barrie, was born on May 9, 1860, and died on June 19, 1937. Subtracting 1860 from 1937 gives 77 years.

The ship in question is the Clotilde. The context says that when originally built, the chamber was 21 feet long, but then it was lengthened to 34 feet. However, the question is about the ship's length when it was used to bring the captives. Since the Clotilde was a slave ship, the original length might be relevant.

The original length was 21 feet, then extended to 34. But the question is about the ship's length when it was used to bring the captives.

That doesn't make sense. Maybe the chamber refers to a specific part of the ship, like the hold where the slaves were kept.

He was shot down by USAF Captains Craig Underhill and Cesar Rodriguez using their F-15Cs. \n\nNow, the next part is about the manufacturer of the F-15C. The last paragraph in the context states that the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle is an American twin-engine fighter designed by McDonnell Douglas, which is now Boeing. So the F-15 was originally made by McDonnell Douglas, but since the company was acquired by Boeing, it's now part of Boeing.\n\nSo the plane that shot down Sayhood was an F-15C, manufactured by McDonnell Douglas, which is now Boeing. The question is about the manufacturer. The answer would be McDonnell Douglas, but since the context mentions that it's now Boeing, I need to check if the question is asking for the original manufacturer or the current one. The question doesn't specify, but typically, the manufacturer at the time of production would be the answer. However, the context says \"designed by McDonnell Douglas (now Boeing)\", so the answer should include both, but the primary manufacturer at the time would be McDonnell Douglas. However, since the F-15 is currently produced by Boeing, but in the Gulf War (which is 1990s), McDonnell Douglas was still the manufacturer. So the answer is McDonnell Douglas. But the context says \"now Boeing\", so maybe the answer should mention both? Wait, the question is about the manufacturer of the plane that shot him down. The plane is an F-15C. The manufacturer is McDonnell Douglas, but since the company is now Boeing, perhaps the answer is Boeing? Or is it still considered McDonnell Douglas? Hmm. The context says \"designed by McDonnell Douglas (now Boeing)\", so the manufacturer at the time would be McDonnell Douglas. However, if the question is asking for the current name, it's Boeing. But the Gulf War happened in 1991, and McDonnell Douglas was acquired by Boeing in 1997. So during the time of the incident, the manufacturer was McDonnell Douglas. Therefore, the answer should be McDonnell",

Therefore, her birth year is 1927.\n\nI should double-check to make sure there's no confusion with other singers mentioned. The other songs and artists like Robyn, Kim Wilde, and Vanilla Fudge aren't relevant here. The key info is about Patti Page's birth year.

The context mentions that Taipei is a special municipality in Taiwan and that it's located at the northern tip of the island. \n\nLooking through the context, there's a sentence that says: \"It is about 25 km southwest of the northern port city Keelung.\" Since the museum is in Taipei, and it's 25 km southwest of Keelung, that would mean Keelung is 25 km northeast of Taipei.

But the question says \"north,\" not northeast. Let me check again.\n\nThe context says the museum is \"about 25 km southwest of the northern port city Keelung.\" So if the museum is southwest of Keelung, then Keelung would be northeast of the museum.

      "ground_truth_answer": "The first Latina Supreme Court Justice, Sonia Sotomayor, was part of the majority decision of the case Alleyne v. United States, which upheld the previous supreme court case \"Apprendi v. New Jersey\" (2000).",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The question is asking about the first Latina Supreme Court Justice being part of a majority decision that upheld a previous Supreme Court case. \n\nFirst, from the context provided, Sonia Sotomayor is mentioned as the first Latina justice. The context also references a case from 2013, which mentions \"Apprendi v. California\" from 1979. Wait, no, Apprendi was 2000, but the context says 1979 here. Hmm, maybe a typo? Let me check again. The context says \"Apprendi v. 357 (1979)\", but Apprendi was actually decided in 2000. That might be an error in the context. Anyway, moving on.\n\nThe 2013 case mentioned in the context is probably the one where Sotomayor was part of the majority. The question is which previous case did that 2013 case uphold. The answer needs to be the case that was upheld by the 2013 case, which the context links to Apprendi. But since Apprendi is from 2000, maybe the 2013 case upheld Apprendi? Let me think.\n\nThe context also mentions that Ruth Bader Ginsburg argued a case (Duren v. Hardwick?) before becoming a justice. But that's probably not directly relevant here. \n\nSo, the key points: The first Latina justice is Sotomayor. She joined the Court in 2009. The 2013 case she was part of the majority decision upheld a previous case. The context mentions Apprendi v. California, which is about the Sixth Amendment. The 2013 case might be \"Descamps v. United States\" or \"Taylor v. United States\", but I'm not sure. However, the context says the 2013 case decided something in line with Apprendi. So if the 2013 case upheld Apprendi, then the answer would be Apprendi. But the context says \"in line with Apprendi v. California\", which suggests that the 2013 case was following Apprendi's precedent. Therefore, the answer would be Apprendi v. California. But the context mentions Apprend",

The user is asking for the manufacturer of the car that inspired the design of the Ford CD2 platform. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the context provided. The Ford CD2 platform is mentioned as being based on Mazda's GF platform, which was used by the Mazda Capella/626. The body design was done by Giovanni Michelotti, and they used components from the 2000 saloon, including a 2.0L 6-cylinder engine. There's also mention of possible use of other engines if the car went into production.\n\nThe key part here is that the design inspiration for the Ford CD2 platform comes from Mazda's GF platform. The GF platform was used for the Mazda Capella and Mazda 626. So the manufacturer here would be Mazda. \n\nWait, but the question is about the car used for design inspiration. The Ford CD2's design is based on Mazda's GF platform. Therefore, the manufacturer of that car (the one providing the platform) is Mazda. The Ford CD2 itself is a joint project between Ford and Mazda, but the design inspiration specifically comes from Mazda's existing platform. \n\nI don't see any other manufacturers mentioned in the context related to the design inspiration. The Spec Racer Ford part is about racing cars, which seems unrelated to the CD2 platform's design. So the answer should be Mazda.\n</think>\n\nThe manufacturer of the car used as design inspiration for the Ford CD2 platform is **Mazda**.

John Travolta's character in the movie is the owner, but the actual real-life founder is Mickey Gilley. \n\nI need to make sure there's no confusion here. The movie is based on the real-life club, and the character Travolta plays is the owner, but the club itself was founded by Mickey Gilley. The answer should be Mickey Gilley. \n\nLet me double-check the context.

The question is asking about an American who is a German literature translator and did a thesis on an Austrian prodigy born in 1874, and where they taught.\n\nFirst, the American mentioned is Vincent Kling, as stated in the context. He's a scholar and translator of German literature. The Austrian prodigy born in 1874 is Hugo von Hofmannsthal. The context mentions that Hofmannsthal was an Austrian prodigy, novelist, etc., and his birth year is given as 1874.\n\nNow, the question is about where Vincent Kling taught.

The context says \"He also spent some time at Georg-August-Universit\u00e4t in G\u00f6ttingen, Germany, and later taught at the University of Vienna under a Fulbright scholarship.\" The \"He\" here refers to the Austrian prodigy? No, no. Wait, the previous sentences talk about Hofmannsthal, but then the next sentence starts with \"He also spent some time...\" which might refer to someone else. Wait, let me check again.\n\nLooking back, the context mentions Hofmannsthal first. Then the next paragraph starts with \"He also spent some time...\" Wait, maybe there's a transition here. Let me read the full context again.\n\nThe context is structured as follows:\n\n- Vincent Kling is an American scholar and translator of German literature.\n\n- Then a paragraph about Hofmannsthal, the Austrian prodigy born 1874.\n\n- Then a paragraph about Austrian literature.\n\n- Then a sentence: \"He also spent some time at Georg-August-Universit\u00e4t in G\u00f6ttingen, Germany, and later taught at the University of Vienna under a Fulbright scholarship.\"\n\nWait, who is \"He\" here?

Then there's a section about Rhodesia being an unrecognised state from 1965 to 1979, equivalent to modern Zimbabwe, with its capital in Salisbury (now Harare). \n\nSo, the key points here are that McPhun played for Rhodesia in the Currie Cup. The state in question is Rhodesia, which had its capital in Salisbury. However, the context also says that Salisbury is now Harare, but during the time Rhodesia existed, it was called Salisbury. The question is about the state that hosted the Currie Cup when McPhun played. Since Rhodesia is the state mentioned here, and it's equivalent to modern Zimbabwe, but the name of the state during his time would be Rhodesia.\n\nWait, but the Currie Cup is a South African competition. Wait, the context says that Rhodesia was an unrecognised state, and the Currie Cup is South Africa's premier domestic rugby union competition. So how did Rhodesia participate? Maybe because Rhodesia was part of Southern Africa, and before it became Zimbabwe, teams from Rhodesia might have participated in South African competitions? Or perhaps the Currie Cup was a regional competition that included teams from Rhodesia?\n\nThe context mentions that John David McPhun played for Rhodesia in the Currie Cup. So the state he played for was Rhodesia, whose capital was Salisbury. The answer should be Rhodesia. But since Rhodesia is now Zimbabwe, but the question is about the state at the time he played, which was Rhodesia. The answer should be Rhodesia.

The context directly connects \"The Smurfs: The Legend of Smurfy Hollow\" to \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" by Washington Irving, which was first published in 1820. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other story mentioned here. The other stories mentioned are \"It Grows On You\" by Stephen King and another one in the context, but those aren't related to The Smurfs. The answer should be \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" by Washington Irving. The movie is a Smurfs adaptation of that classic story.\n</think>\n\nThe 2013 Smurfs movie *The Smurfs: The Legend of Smurfy Hollow* is based on Washington Irving's short story **\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\"**, which was originally published in 1820. \n\n**Answer:** \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" by Washington Irving.",

The question is asking which Indian film playback singer and devotional singer contributed to both the movie \"Baabul\" (2006) and Sukshinder Shinda's album \"Collaborations 3.\" \n\nFirst, I need to look at the context provided. The context mentions Richa Sharma as an Indian film playback singer and devotional singer. It also states that in 2006, she sang Bollywood's longest track, the \"bidaai\" song, in the film \"Baabul.\" So that connects her to \"Baabul.\"\n\nNow, the album \"Collaborations 3\" is by Sukshinder Shinda. The context lists the composers and lyricists for the album but doesn't explicitly mention the singers. However, since the question is about a singer contributing to both \"Baabul\" and the album, and Richa Sharma is the only devotional and playback singer mentioned in the context, it's possible she's the one involved in both. \n\nWait, the context doesn't directly say she's on \"Collaborations 3,\" but the question is implying that there is someone who contributed to both. Since the only singer mentioned in the context who worked on \"Baabul\" is Richa Sharma, and the album is by Sukshinder Shinda, maybe she's the one. The album's composers and lyricists are listed, but the singers aren't. However, given that the question is structured this way, the answer must be Richa Sharma. The other names mentioned are male singers like Sripathi Panditaradhyula Balasubrahmanyam, but he's not linked to \"Baabul\" in the context. So the answer should be Richa Sharma.\n</think>\n\nThe Indian film playback singer and devotional singer who contributed to the film \"Baabul\" (2006) and Sukshinder Shinda's album \"Collaborations 3\" is **Richa Sharma**. She sang the \"bidaai\" song in \"Baabul\" (2006) and is noted as a devotional and playback singer in the context.

Let me look at the context provided.\n\nFirst, the context says: \"His parents Joseph Sanborn and Eunice Ellen (Winslow) Lamson died when he was 3 years old and he was adopted by the Virgil Scribner family near Manchester, Maine.\" So, the key part here is \"near Manchester, Maine.\" \n\nThen there's some additional info about Manchester being in Kennebec County, Maine. The next sentences mention Kennebec being named after the county, and then a note about a different Kennebec in North Carolina. But that's probably a distractor since the main question is about Maine.\n\nSo, putting it together: Frank was adopted near Manchester, Maine. Since Manchester is in Kennebec County, the answer should be Manchester. The other mentions of Kennebec in North Carolina are irrelevant here. The question specifically asks for the town in Kennebec County, which is Manchester. Let me double-check the context again to make sure I didn't miss anything.

The context provided mentions \"Mrs. Bixby and the Colonel's Coat\" as his variation, which first appeared in 1959. But the key part here is the sales figures.\n\nLooking through the context, there's a line that says his books have sold more than 250 million copies worldwide. Wait, but does that include all his works or just specific ones? The question is about his variation on the anecdote, which is the story \"Mrs. Bixby...\" But the context doesn't specify the sales of that particular story. The 250 million figure is for his books in general. The question is tricky because it's asking about the sales of that specific work. However, the context doesn't provide a specific number for that story. The only sales number given is the total for all his books. Since the question is about his variation (the story), but there's no specific number mentioned, maybe the answer is that it's not specified, but the total sales of his books are over 250 million. Wait, but the question is phrased as \"how many copies of Roald Dahl's variation...\" which is the story. Since the context doesn't give a specific number for that story, but mentions the total sales of his books, perhaps the answer is that the exact number isn't provided, but the total sales of his books are over 250 million. However, the question might be trying to trick us into using the 250 million figure even though it's not specific to the story. Alternatively, maybe the answer is that the information isn't given in the context. Let me check again. The context says \"his books have sold more than 250 million copies worldwide.\" The question is about the variation, which is a short story. But the 250 million is for his books, which could include all his works, including short stories. However, the specific story's sales aren't mentioned. So the answer would be that the context doesn't provide the exact number for that particular story, but the total for all his books is over 250 million.
