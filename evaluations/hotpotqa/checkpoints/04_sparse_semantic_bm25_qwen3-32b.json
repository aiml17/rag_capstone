The question is asking who the new permanent member on the fourteenth season of So You Think You Can Dance played in High School Musical.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the context provided. The context mentions that the fourteenth season of the show returned on June 12, 2017. The new permanent member added to the judging panel is Vanessa Hudgens. The rest of the judges are Nigel Lythgoe and Mary Murphy, but the key here is Vanessa Hudgens.\n\nNow, the next part of the context talks about Vanessa Hudgens' discography. It says she has two studio albums, etc. But importantly, it mentions that she recorded eleven singles and other releases as her \"High School Musical\" character Gabriella Montez. So, in the High School Musical films, she played Gabriella Montez. The question is asking which character she played there, since she's the new judge in the context.\n\nSo putting it together: the new permanent member on season 14 is Vanessa Hudgens, and in High School Musical, she played Gabriella Montez. Therefore, the answer should be Gabriella Montez.\n</think>\n\nThe new permanent member on the fourteenth season of *So You Think You Can Dance* is Vanessa Hudgens.

The Dutch East Indies became a Dutch colony under the government in 1800, formed from the nationalized colonies of the Dutch East India Company.\n\nSo the key points here are: Minahasa, journalist, novelist, active in the Dutch East Indies, which became a colony under the Dutch government in 1800.

The other information about the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency and plug-in electric vehicles seems unrelated, so I can ignore that. \n\nThe question specifically refers to the colonies incorporated into the Dutch government in 1800, which is the Dutch East Indies.

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking where Jack J. Stephans coached from 1979 to 1980. First, I need to look through the provided context to find the relevant information.\n\nLooking at the context about Stephans, it says he was a former American football coach. The details mention his coaching positions: he was at Jersey City State College (now New Jersey City University) from 1966 to 1973, then at William Paterson University in Wayne Township, New Jersey from 1975 to 1977. Then the next position is from 1979 to 1980 at Fordham University. \n\nSo the key here is the time frame 1979-1980. The context clearly states that during those years, he was at Fordham University. Now, Fordham University is located in the Bronx, New York City. But the question is asking for the city. So the answer should be New York City. Wait, but sometimes people might refer to the specific location within the city. However, the context doesn't mention the city explicitly for Fordham, but common knowledge is that Fordham is in New York. Let me check if the context gives any location for Fordham. The context just says \"Fordham University\" without specifying the city. But since the question is based on the provided context, maybe I need to infer. However, in the context, when mentioning William Paterson University, it specifies Wayne Township, New Jersey. For Fordham, it doesn't specify, but the user is asking for the city. Since the context doesn't explicitly state the city, but Fordham is a well-known university in New York City, the answer would be New York City. Alternatively, maybe the answer is just Fordham, but the question asks for the city. Therefore, the correct answer is New York City.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: New York City. \n\nStephans coached at Fordham University from 1979 to 1980, and Fordham University is located in the Bronx, New York City.

The question is asking about the youngest male model ever to participate in Seoul Fashion Week, who stars with Park Hae-jin and Kang So-ra in a TV series, and we need to find out the date it last aired.\n\nFirst, looking at the context provided. There's a mention of someone who debuted in 2005 as a runway model and became the youngest male model in Seoul Fashion Week. Then there's a TV series called \"Doctor Stranger\" from 2014, starring Lee Jong-suk, Jin Se-yeon, Park Hae-jin, and Kang So-ra.

The question is about the last air date. Since it's 20 episodes and it started on May 5, but the exact end date is given as July 8, 2014.

Then there's the 1812 Overture by Tchaikovsky, which is about Russia defending against Napoleon in 1812. The context also talks about Gribeauval cannons, which were French cannons capable of firing canister and round shot. The 4-pounder is a type of French cannon. Then there's the Victoria Symphony Splash event in Victoria, BC, where the symphony plays on a barge in the Inner Harbour.\n\nThe question is about who will conduct the firing of cannons during a musical piece celebrating Napoleon's defeat in Russia. The key here is connecting the musical piece to the cannons. The 1812 Overture is the one related to Napoleon's defeat. Now, the Victoria Symphony Splash event is mentioned, which is produced by the Victoria Symphony. So, if they are performing the 1812 Overture, which often includes cannon fire during the overture (as it's a common practice in performances of this piece), then the cannons would be part of that event.\n\nBut the context doesn't explicitly mention cannons being fired during the Victoria Symphony Splash. However, the 1812 Overture is known to have cannon effects, sometimes actual cannons if available. The Gribeauval cannons are historical French cannons, but the question is about who conducts the firing. The Victoria Symphony produces the event, so maybe they coordinate with local artillery or historical reenactment groups. However, the answer might be that there's no specific person mentioned in the context. Wait, the context doesn't mention any conductor for the cannons. The Victoria Symphony Splash is produced by the Victoria Symphony, so perhaps the conductor of the symphony would be the one overseeing the cannons during the performance.

The context also talks about the 1933 Imperial Airways crash and the 1938 Jersey Airport disaster, but those are earlier. The key here is comparing the two specific events mentioned in the question. \n\nSo the answer should confirm that Tenerife occurred first in 1977, and Charkhi Dadri was later in 1996. Also, since Tenerife had more deaths, it's more dangerous. The user's statement that Charkhi Dadri was less dangerous is correct, and the order of occurrence is Tenerife first.\n</think>\n\nThe Tenerife airport disaster occurred first on March 27, 1977, while the Charkhi Dadri mid-air collision happened later on November 12, 1996. The Tenerife disaster remains the deadliest aviation accident in history (583 fatalities), making it more dangerous than the Charkhi Dadri crash (349 fatalities). Thus, the Tenerife disaster occurred first and was more severe in terms of loss of life. \n\n**Answer:** The Tenerife airport disaster occurred first in 1977, and it was more dangerous than the Charkhi Dadri crash.",

From the context provided, the step-over, also called the pedalada, den\u00edlson, or scissors, is a dribbling move.

One of his notable works is playing Friday in Luis Bu\u00f1uel's \"Robinson Crusoe.\" Wait, actually, the way it's written here says \"his best-known role, playing Friday in Luis Bu\u00f1uel's 'Robinson Crusoe'.\" But wait, Luis Bu\u00f1uel was a Spanish filmmaker, and \"Robinson Crusoe\" is a film from 1954. But the context says Victor Salva played Friday in that film. Hmm, but I thought Bu\u00f1uel's \"Robinson Crusoe\" was from 1954, but maybe that's correct. Anyway, Victor Salva is a director and screenwriter who has won Silver Ariel awards.\n\nThen, Emilio \"El Indio\" Fern\u00e1ndez was a Mexican film director, actor, and screenwriter. He was born in 1904 and died in 1986. The context mentions that his older brother was Emilio Fern\u00e1ndez, but wait, that can't be right. Wait, the text says: \"His older brother was actor/director Emilio Fern\u00e1ndez.\" Wait, but the person being described here is Emilio Fern\u00e1ndez himself. That seems like a mistake. Maybe it's a typo. Let me check again. The context says: \"Emilio 'El Indio' Fern\u00e1ndez (born Emilio Fern\u00e1ndez Romo, March 26, 1904 \u2013 August 6, 1986) was a Mexican film director, actor and screenwriter. His older brother was actor/director Emilio Fern\u00e1ndez.\" That seems contradictory. If his name is Emilio Fern\u00e1ndez, then his older brother can't be Emilio Fern\u00e1ndez. Maybe that's a mistake in the context. Perhaps it's supposed to be someone else. Maybe the original text had a different name, but here it's a typo. Maybe the brother is someone else, but the context as given says his older brother was Emilio Fern\u00e1ndez. That's confusing. Maybe it's a trick question, but perhaps that's not important here.\n\nThe other part is about the movie Bugambilia from 1",

So, if Stitch's Great Escape! replaced the previous theater-in-the-round attraction, and that previous one was in Tomorrowland, then the answer should be Tomorrowland. Let me check again. The first context says ExtraTERRORestrial was in Tomorrowland, and Stitch's Great Escape! is also in Tomorrowland. So Stitch's Great Escape! replaced the previous one there. Therefore, the answer is Tomorrowland.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: Tomorrowland",

The question is asking for the population of a county as of the 2010 census, which was named after the 13th Speaker of the House of Representatives.\n\nFirst, I need to identify who the 13th Speaker of the House was. From the context provided, there's a mention of someone who \"previously served as the 13th Speaker of the House of Representatives and as Governor of Tennessee.\" So that person is both the 13th Speaker and a former Governor of Tennessee. Let me think... The 13th Speaker of the House... Maybe it's someone like Sam Rayburn? Wait, but Sam Rayburn was the 43rd Speaker. Hmm. Let me check the context again. The context also mentions Thomas Stephen Foley as the 49th Speaker. But the 13th Speaker... Maybe it's someone else. Wait, the county was named after then-governor (and future president) James K. So the county is named after James K, who was a governor and future president. Wait, the county was named after then-governor (and future president) James K. So that's James K. Polk? Because James K. Polk was a governor before becoming president. Let me confirm. James K. Polk was the 11th president of the US and was governor of Tennessee. So if the county was named after him, then the county is Polk County. Now, the question is about the population of that county as of 2010. The context says \"As of the 2010 census, the population was 16,825.\" So that must be referring to Polk County. Therefore, the answer is 16,825. Let me make sure I connected all the dots correctly. The 13th Speaker mentioned in the context is someone else, but the county was named after James K. (the governor and future president), which is Polk. The population given is 16,825. So the answer should be that number.\n</think>\n\nThe county in question is Polk County, named after James K. Polk, who served as both Governor of Tennessee and the 11th U.S. President.

But wait, he died in June, so he didn't make it to his 77th birthday. Wait, 1937 minus 1860 is 77 years.

The context states he was born on 12 March 1928 and died on 16 September 2016. Let's calculate that. From 1928 to 2016 is 88 years. He died in September, so he would have turned 88 in March.

The first one is a storyboard artist who worked with the Coen brothers and other filmmakers. The second Todd Anderson is a retired Australian rugby league player from the 1990s. The question refers to J. Todd Anderson, which probably is the same as the first one, the storyboard artist.\n\nSo, the key here is that J. Todd Anderson primarily worked with the Coen brothers.

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out who the manufacturer of the plane that shot down Captain Jameel Sayhood is. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the context provided. The question is about the Gulf War and an Iraqi pilot named Jameel Sayhood. The context says he was shot down by USAF Captains Craig Underhill and Cesar Rodriguez using their F-15Cs. So the plane involved in shooting him down is the F-15C.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the manufacturer of that plane. The F-15C is a model of the F-15 Eagle, which is a fighter jet. I remember that the F-15 series is made by Boeing. But wait, wasn't Boeing involved in making the F-15? Or was it another company? Let me think. The F-15 was originally developed by McDonnell Douglas. But then, I think Boeing acquired McDonnell Douglas in the 1990s. So after the acquisition, Boeing became the manufacturer of the F-15. Since the Gulf War happened in 1991, and the acquisition was in 1997, the F-15Cs used during the Gulf War would have been built by McDonnell Douglas before Boeing took over. However, the question is about the manufacturer, and since the F-15C is a model that was produced by McDonnell Douglas, but Boeing is the current manufacturer. Wait, but the question is about the specific plane that shot down Sayhood. Since the Gulf War was in 1991, the manufacturer at that time would have been McDonnell Douglas. However, sometimes when companies merge, the product is still attributed to the post-merger company. But I need to confirm which company was responsible for producing the F-15C during the Gulf War era.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer expects the current manufacturer, which is Boeing. But the question is about the manufacturer of the plane that shot him down. Since the plane was in service during the Gulf War, the manufacturer would be the one who built it before 1997. So McDonnell Douglas. However, Boeing acquired McDonnell Douglas in 1997, so technically, the manufacturer is Boeing now. But the plane was built by McDonnell Douglas. Hmm. This is a bit tricky. \n\nWait, the question is asking for the manufacturer of the plane",

The question is asking which campaign brought out the term \"Vichy Republican\" on social media, and it was formally launched on June 16, 2015, at Trump Tower in New York City.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the context provided. The context mentions that the term \"Vichy Republican\" emerged in 2016 regarding the U.S. Presidential campaign of Donald Trump. Then, there's a sentence about the 2016 presidential campaign of Donald Trump being formally launched on June 16, 2015, at Trump Tower in NYC.\n\nSo the key points here are: the term Vichy Republican is linked to Trump's 2016 campaign, which was launched in 2015. The question is phrased a bit tricky, but it's asking for the campaign that led to the term being used. Since the term came up during his 2016 campaign, but the campaign was launched in 2015, the answer should be the 2016 presidential campaign of Donald Trump. The other info about Trump Tower in White Plains is probably a distractor. Also, the part about social media and fashion is unrelated. So the answer is straightforward from the context.\n</think>\n\nThe campaign that brought out the term \"Vichy Republican\" on social media was the **2016 presidential campaign of Donald Trump**, formally launched on June 16, 2015, at Trump Tower in New York City.

Let me check the context provided.\n\nFirst, looking at Caesalpinia: the context says it's a genus in the legume family, Fabaceae. But the description doesn't mention the number of species. Hmm, maybe I need to recall or infer. Wait, legumes often have large genera. For example, I know that Acacia has hundreds of species. But Caesalpinia... I'm not sure. Maybe I should check the other genus first.\n\nAchimenes is described as having about 25 species. The context states it's a genus of tropical and subtropical rhizomatous perennials in the Gesneriaceae family. So 25 species is specified here.\n\nNow, for Caesalpinia, the context doesn't give a number. But maybe I can think about common knowledge. Wait, Caesalpinia is part of the Fabaceae family, which is a large family. Some genera in Fabaceae are known to be large. For example, Acacia has over 1,000 species. But Caesalpinia... I think it's a smaller genus. Let me try to remember. I recall that Caesalpinia might have around 50-100 species. For example, some sources I've seen mention Caesalpinia has about 70 species. If that's the case, then 70 would be more than Achimenes' 25. But the context doesn't specify, so maybe I need to rely on the given info.\n\nWait, the user provided the context, and in the context, only Achimenes has the number of species mentioned (about 25). Caesalpinia's entry doesn't mention the number. So maybe the answer is based on the given info. But the question is asking which has more species.

The context provided talks about traditional Chinese marriage being a ceremonial ritual with pre-arrangement by families. It mentions that romantic love and monogamy were the norm for most citizens. \n\nSo, the key here is that traditionally, marriages were arranged by families, not based on the individuals' romantic feelings. The question is about what was needed to move away from that system. The answer probably relates to the emergence of romantic love as a factor in marriage decisions. \n\nLooking at the context again, it says \"romantic love and monogamy was the norm for most citizens.\" Wait, that might be a bit confusing. If romantic love was the norm, but marriages were pre-arranged by families, there's a contradiction. Maybe the context is saying that despite the pre-arranged marriages, romantic love and monogamy were the norms. Or perhaps it's that the traditional system was pre-arranged, but over time, people started valuing romantic love more, leading to a divergence from the pre-arranged system.\n\nThe answer would then be the need for romantic love to become a central factor in marriage decisions instead of family arrangements. But I need to make sure the context supports this. The context does mention that romantic love was the norm, which might suggest that even within the traditional system, there was a cultural emphasis on romantic love. However, the pre-arrangement by families was still the practice. So maybe the divergence required a shift in societal values to prioritize individual choice and romantic love over family arrangements.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is more about the influence of modernization or external factors, but the question is about what was needed in the context of traditional practices. Since the context doesn't mention modern China, it's about traditional practices. The answer likely refers to the cultural shift towards valuing romantic love and individual choice in marriage, moving away from family-arranged unions.\n</think>\n\nTo diverge from the traditional Chinese practice of uniting spouses through pre-arrangement between families, **the prioritization of romantic love and individual choice in marriage decisions** would have been necessary.

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking for the birth year of the singer who popularized \"I'll Keep the Lovelight Burning.\" From the context provided, the song was popularized by Patti Page in 1949. So I need to find out when Patti Page was born.\n\nFirst, I remember that Patti Page was a popular singer in the 1940s and 1950s. But I don't recall her exact birth year. Let me think. I know she was active in the 40s, but when was she born? Maybe around the 1920s? Let me try to recall. If she was popularizing songs in 1949, she was probably in her 20s or 30s then. So if she was, say, 25 in 1949, she would have been born in 1924. Wait, but I think she was a bit older. Maybe 1927? Wait, I need to be accurate here.\n\nWait, I think Patti Page was born in 1927. Let me check my memory. If she was born in 1927, then in 1949 she would have been 22. That seems plausible for a singer starting out. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe 1925? Let me think if there's any other clues. The context mentions that the song was written in 1942, and she popularized it in 1949. So she was probably already established by then. \n\nWait, I think I remember that Patti Page was born on November 8, 1927. So if that's the case, her birth year is 1927. Therefore, the answer should be 1927. But I need to be sure. Let me see if there's any other information in the context that can help. The context also mentions other songs and artists, but none of them relate directly to Patti Page's birth year. So I have to rely on my existing knowledge. \n\nYes, I'm pretty confident that Patti Page was born in 1927. So the answer is 1927.\n</think>\n\nThe singer who popularized \"I'll Keep the",

Let me start by looking at the context provided.\n\nFirst, the Lingnan Fine Arts Museum is in Nangang District, Taipei, Taiwan. The context mentions several locations with distances. Let me go through each sentence again.\n\nThe first sentence about the museum is followed by: \"It lies approximately 25 km north-east of Mak\u00f3w Mazowiecki and 89 km north of Warsaw.\" Wait, Mak\u00f3w Mazowiecki and Warsaw are in Poland, right? That seems out of place here. Maybe that's a mistake or some error in the context? Because the museum is in Taiwan, those Polish cities don't make sense. Maybe a copy-paste error?\n\nThen the next sentence: \"It lies approximately 25 km north of Bia\u0142a Podlaska and 119 km north of the regional capital Lublin.\" Again, Bia\u0142a Podlaska and Lublin are in Poland. So this seems like the same error. Definitely not relevant to Taipei.\n\nNext: \"It is about 25 km southwest of the northern port city Keelung.\" Ah, here we have Keelung mentioned as a port city 25 km southwest of somewhere. Since the museum is in Taipei, and Keelung is a known port city in Taiwan, this seems relevant. The sentence says the museum is about 25 km southwest of Keelung. So if the museum is southwest of Keelung, then Keelung would be northeast of the museum. But the question is asking for a city 25 km north of the museum. Wait, southwest and north are directions here. Let me visualize this.\n\nIf the museum is 25 km southwest of Keelung, then Keelung is 25 km northeast of the museum. So the port city here is Keelung. But the question is asking for a port city 25 km north of the museum. So if Keelung is northeast, then maybe the north part is the direction. But the exact direction is southwest, so maybe the north component is part of that.

He's known for works like \"Vidocq\" and \"Catwoman.\" The context also mentions that he was born on July 4, 1957.

Well, both are directors, but Pitof also works in visual effects supervision. However, the main overlap is in directing. But the question is whether their professional careers are the same.

Wait, the Timberwolves are mentioned in the context, but the Suns are the ones who acquired Cassell. But the question is about the Timberwolves season. Hmm.\n\nWait, the context says that during the 2004-05 NBA season, the Timberwolves had a .500 record for the first half. Then, in the offseason, the Suns acquired Cassell and Horry from the Rockets. So Sam Cassell was with the Rockets before joining the Suns. The question is about what honors he had before the Timberwolves' 2004-05 season. But the context doesn't mention any titles or honors for Cassell prior to that. The context only mentions that the Timberwolves made the Conference Finals the previous year (2003-04 season), but that's about the team, not Cassell. Cassell was with the Rockets then, I think. Wait, the 2004-05 season is when the Timberwolves had their .500 start. The context doesn't say anything about Cassell's honors before that. The answer might be that there's no information provided in the context about his titles before the 2004-05 season.

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out this question. The question is asking about Ruffin Horne McNeill Jr., who became an interim head coach after the suspension of a head coach who led the team to winning seasons every year of his tenure. The answer needs to specify what that tenure was.\n\nFirst, looking at the context provided. The first paragraph talks about Michael Charles Leach, also known as Mike Leach, who is the head coach of Washington State and previously led Texas Tech to winning seasons every year of his tenure. Then, the next part mentions Ruffin McNeill, who was the interim head coach of Texas Tech after Mike Leach was suspended and later fired. \n\nSo, the key points here are: McNeill became interim head coach at Texas Tech after Leach was suspended. The question is asking about the tenure of the head coach (Leach) that McNeill replaced. The answer should be the duration or the position that Leach held before being suspended. Since the context says that Leach led Texas Tech to winning seasons in every year of his tenure, and McNeill became interim after Leach's suspension, the answer is referring to Leach's tenure as the head coach of Texas Tech. \n\nThe question is structured to ask for the position or role that the suspended head coach (Leach) had, which McNeill took over. The answer is that Leach was the head coach, so the answer should be \"tenure\" or more specifically \"tenure as head coach.\" But looking at the exact wording in the context: \"every year of his tenure.\" So the answer is \"tenure.\" But the question is phrased as \"his what?\" So the blank is filled with the noun that describes the period during which the head coach was leading the team. The answer is \"tenure\" because the context says \"every year of his tenure.\" Therefore, the answer is \"tenure.\"\n</think>\n\nAnswer: Ruffin Horne McNeill Jr. was named interim head coach after the suspension of a head coach who led the team to winning seasons in every year of his **tenure**.",

The question is asking how many personnel the Navy, which had Gilliam-class attack transports, has on active duty. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context to find the relevant information. The context mentions the USS Carlisle (APA-69), which is a Gilliam-class attack transport from World War II. But the question is about the current Navy's active duty personnel.\n\nLooking through the context, there's a paragraph about the Navy's current status. It states: \"The service has 322,421 personnel on active duty and 107,577 in the Navy Reserve.\" The \"service\" here refers to the Navy, since the previous sentences talk about the Navy's fleet and aircraft. \n\nSo the answer should be 322,421 active duty personnel. The mention of the Gilliam-class is just historical context, but the actual numbers are in the paragraph about the current Navy. I need to make sure there's no other number mentioned elsewhere. The Marine Corps part talks about 550,000 records, but that's for the Marine Corps, not the Navy. The Air Force's 62d Airlift Wing has 2,200 personnel, but again, that's a different branch.

The context mentions that Nia Kay, a competitor in The Rap Game season 2, stated that Leshurr was one of her influences. So, Lady Leshurr is an influence on Nia Kay, who was in season 2. The question is about the winner of the season where Lady Leshurr was an influence. Since Nia Kay was in season 2 and cited Leshurr as an influence, the winner of that season (season 2) would be the answer.\n\nWait, but the question is phrased a bit tricky. It says \"the season of The Rap Game where a contestant named Lady Leshurr as one of her influences.\" Wait, no, the original context says that Nia Kay, a contestant in season 2, had Lady Leshurr as an influence. So the question is asking who won the season (season 2) where a contestant (Nia Kay) had Lady Leshurr as an influence. Therefore, the answer would be the winner of The Rap Game season 2. \n\nBut the context doesn't mention who won season 2. The context only talks about Nia Kay being a competitor and her influence. The rest of the context talks about Lady Leshurr's other appearances, like on King of Mask Singer, and some other people like Nicholas James Donnelly. But there's no information about the winner of The Rap Game season 2. \n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. The question is phrased as \"the season of The Rap Game where a contestant named Lady Leshurr as one of her influences.\" Wait, maybe there's confusion here. The contestant is Nia Kay, who named Lady Leshurr as an influence. The question is asking for the winner of that season (season 2). But the context doesn't state who won season 2. Therefore, based on the given context, we can't determine the winner. However, maybe there's an assumption here that the user expects me to know the answer from external knowledge?

The question is asking which state in Southern Africa, with its capital in Salisbury, hosted the Currie Cup where John David McPhun played. \n\nFirst, looking at the context provided.

Its capital was Salisbury, which is now Harare. \n\nSo, the key points here are that Rhodesia is the state in question. The capital was Salisbury, which is now called Harare. The Currie Cup is a South African rugby competition, but Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) participated in it. The question is about the state that hosted the Currie Cup when McPhun played. Since McPhun played for Rhodesia, the state would be Rhodesia. However, the answer might need to consider the current name, but the question specifically refers to the state as it was when he played, which was Rhodesia.\n\nWait, the question says \"hosted the Currie Cup in which John David McPhun played.\" But the Currie Cup is a South African competition.

Hmm, this is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, the context says that Rhodesia was an unrecognised state, a de facto successor to Southern Rhodesia. Southern Rhodesia was a British colony until 1923 when it achieved responsible government. Then in 1965, it became Rhodesia (unrecognised).

The context says that the 2005 film was released on December 29, 2005, runs for 119 minutes. So if the question is mixing up the roles, but the answer is about the runtime of the film where she played in the context, which is \"King and the Clown,\" then the answer is 119 minutes. But the question says she played Prince Yeonsan. Wait, in the context, Prince Yeonsan is the one in the 1961 film. So maybe there's a mistake here. But perhaps the question is referring to the 2005 film where she played a character related to Prince Yeonsan. The user might have made a mistake in the question, but based on the context, the film she was in that's related to Prince Yeonsan is \"King and the Clown,\" which is 119 minutes. So the answer should be 119.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: 119",

The user is asking which Indian playback and devotional singer contributed to both the film \"Baabul\" (2006) and Sukshinder Shinda's album \"Collaborations 3.\" \n\nFirst, I need to look at the context provided. The first paragraph mentions Richa Sharma, born in 1980, who is a playback and devotional singer. It specifically states that in 2006, she sang Bollywood's longest track, the \"bidaai\" song, in \"Baabul\" (2006). That's one part of the question.\n\nNext, the second paragraph talks about \"Collaborations 3,\" which is an album in a series by Sukshinder Shinda. Now, the question is whether Richa Sharma is also associated with this album. The context doesn't explicitly mention her involvement with Sukshinder Shinda's work. However, Sukshinder Shinda is a well-known music producer in the Bhangra and Punjabi music scene. If \"Collaborations 3\" is his album, it's possible that he collaborated with various artists, including playback singers like Richa Sharma. But the context provided doesn't directly link her to that album. \n\nWait, the third paragraph introduces S.P. Balasubrahmanyam, a renowned playback singer with many awards. But the question is about someone who contributed to \"Baabul\" and Sukshinder's album. Since the context only mentions Richa Sharma in relation to \"Baabul\" and Sukshinder's album is mentioned separately, there's no direct link provided between Richa Sharma and Sukshinder Shinda's \"Collaborations 3.\" However, maybe there's an assumption here that the same person is involved in both. \n\nBut the user is asking for the answer based on the provided context. The context only states that Richa Sharma was in \"Baabul\" (2006) and that Sukshinder Shinda has an album called \"Collaborations 3.\" There's no explicit mention of Richa Sharma being part of that album. Unless there's an implicit connection I'm missing.
