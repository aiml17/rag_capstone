      "question": "What should I pay attention to for the clutch pedal?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the provided context, here are the key things to pay attention to regarding the clutch pedal:\n\n1. Fully press the clutch pedal before shifting gears. Pressing the clutch pedal all the way down is necessary when changing gears to prevent damage to the transmission.\n\n2. As you release the clutch pedal, lightly press the accelerator pedal. This coordination of the clutch and accelerator is important for smooth gear shifts.\n\n3. Certain noise from the transmission may be noticeable when the clutch is engaged (pedal released). This noise is normal and not an indication of a problem with the clutch or transmission.\n\n4. Ensure the carpet is securely attached and does not interfere with the operation of the clutch pedal. Unattached or improperly placed carpet could get stuck under the clutch pedal and cause a loss of vehicle control.\n\nIn summary, focus on fully pressing and properly releasing the clutch pedal during gear shifts, be aware of normal transmission noises, and ensure the floor carpet does not impact clutch pedal operation.",
      "generated_response": "**Clutch\u2011pedal checklist**\n\n1. **Full depression before any gear change**  \n   - Always press the clutch pedal all the way down before you move the shifter.  \n   - When you start to release it, add a light amount of throttle so the engine and transmission re\u2011engage smoothly.\n\n2. **Clearance and freedom of movement**  \n   - Make sure the floor carpet is the correct type for your vehicle and is **securely fastened with its grommets**.  \n   - Verify that the carpet (or any floor\u2011mat) does **not** lift, fold, or shift into the clutch\u2011pedal travel path.  \n   - After installing or reinstalling carpet, **fully depress the clutch pedal** (and the brake and accelerator) to confirm there is no interference.\n\n3. **No foreign objects under the carpet**  \n   - Never place towels, keys, tools, or any other items under the carpet where they could be pushed into the pedal area.  \n   - Objects in that space can change the pedal\u2019s position, cause the clutch to stick, or lead to loss of control.\n\n4. **Pedal condition**  \n   - Feel for any abnormal resistance, sticking, or excessive play.  \n   - Normal transmission \u201cidle\u2011noise\u201d when the clutch is engaged (pedal released) is expected, but the pedal itself should move smoothly without grinding or binding.\n\n**In short:**\u202fPress the clutch fully before shifting, keep the pedal\u2019s travel area free of carpet interference or loose objects, and regularly check that the pedal moves freely and without obstruction.",
      "retrieved_chunks": [
        " Shifting Fully press the clutch pedal before shifting gears.  As you release the clutch pedal, lightly press the accelerator pedal.  You should always use FIRST gear when starting from a standing position.  Note: A certain amount of noise from the transmission is normal.  This noise can be most noticeable when the vehicle is idling in NEUTRAL with the clutch engaged (clutch pedal released), but it may also be heard when driving.  The noise may also be more noticeable when the transmission is warm.  This noise is normal and is not an indication of a problem with your clutch or transmission.\n\n Before Climbing A Steep Hill As you approach a hill, consider its grade or steepness.  Determine if it is too steep.  Look to see what the traction is on the hill side trail.  Is the trail straight up and down?  What is on top and the other side?  Are there ruts, rocks, branches or other obstacles on the path?  Can you safely recover the vehicle if something goes wrong?  If everything looks good and you feel confident, shift the transmission into a lower gear with 4L engaged, and proceed with caution, maintaining your momentum as you climb the hill.\n\n Carpet Safety Information Always use carpet designed to fit your vehicle.  Only use carpet that does not interfere with the operation of the pedal assemblies.  Only operate the vehicle when the carpet is securely attached by the grommets so it cannot slip out of position and interfere with the pedal assemblies or impair safe operation of your vehicle in other ways.  WARNING: If operating the vehicle without carpet in place the floor may become hot, and there is a risk of burns.  An improperly attached, damaged, folded, or damaged grommets may cause your carpet to interfere with the accelerator, brake, or clutch pedals and cause a loss of vehicle control.  To prevent SERIOUS INJURY or DEATH: ALWAYS securely attach your carpet using the grommets.  ALWAYS make sure objects cannot fall or slide into the driver\u2019s side floor area when the vehicle is moving.  Objects can become trapped under accelerator, brake, or clutch pedals and could cause a loss of vehicle control.  NEVER place any objects under the carpet (e.g., towels, keys, etc.).  These objects could change the position of the carpet and may cause interference with the accelerator, brake, or clutch pedals.  ONLY install carpet designed to fit your vehicle.  NEVER install carpet that cannot be properly attached and secured to your vehicle.  If the carpet needs to be replaced, only use manufacturer approved carpet for the specific make, model, and year of your vehicle.  If the vehicle carpet has been removed and re-installed, always properly attach carpet to the floor and check that the floor mat fasteners are secure to the vehicle carpet.  Fully depress each pedal to check for interference with the accelerator, brake, or clutch pedals then re-install the floor mats."

These alerts will not be activated in situations where the vehicle\u2019s engine is left running with the key fob inside.\n\n Your vehicle is equipped with a key fob which supports Passive Entry, Remote Keyless Entry (RKE), Keyless Enter \u2018n Go\u2122 (if equipped), and Remote Start (if equipped).  The key fob allows you to lock or unlock the doors and tailgate from distances up to approximately 66 ft (20 m).  The key fob does not need to be pointed at the vehicle to activate the system.  The key fob also contains a mechanical key.  When any of these situations occur, after all open doors are closed, the FOBIK-Safe search will be executed.  If it detects a Passive Entry key fob inside the vehicle, the vehicle will unlock and alert the customer.  If Passive Entry is disabled using the Uconnect system, the key fob protection described in this section remains active/functional.  The electrical components inside of the key fob may be damaged if the key fob is subjected to strong electrical shocks.  In order to ensure complete effectiveness of the electronic devices inside of the key fob, avoid exposing the key fob to direct sunlight.  Once a key fob is programmed to a vehicle, it cannot be repurposed and reprogrammed to another vehicle.  Only key fobs that are programmed to the vehicle electronics can be used to start and operate the vehicle.  Once a key fob is programmed to a vehicle, it cannot be programmed to any other vehicle.  The system uses a key fob, keyless push button ignition and a Radio Frequency (RF) receiver to prevent unauthorized vehicle operation.  Therefore, only key fobs that are programmed to the vehicle can be used to start and operate the vehicle.  The system cannot reprogram a key fob obtained from another vehicle.  Key Fob The doors have to be open and then closed in order for the vehicle to check for the presence of a key fob; the Key Left Vehicle feature will not activate until all of the doors are closed.  These alerts will not be activated in situations where the vehicle\u2019s engine is left running with the key fob inside."

        " The power windows feature allows for movement of the windows with the push of a button.  The power window switches are located on the instrument panel below the climate controls.  Push the switch downward to open the window and pull upward to close the window.  The driver door power window switch and the front passenger door power window switch have an Auto-Down feature.  Push the window switch down, past the detent, and release and the window will go down automatically.  Power Window Switches Never leave children unattended in a vehicle, and do not let children play with power windows.  Do not leave the key fob in or near the vehicle, or in a location accessible to children.  Occupants, particularly unattended children, can become entrapped by the windows while operating the power window switches.  Such entrapment may result in serious injury or death.  The power window switches will remain active for up to 10 minutes after the ignition is placed in the OFF position.  Opening either front door will cancel this feature.  There are window switches located on the rear of the center console for the rear passenger windows.\n\n Auto-Down Feature The driver door power window switch and the front passenger door power window switch have an Auto-Down feature.  Push the window switch down, past the detent, and release and the window will go down automatically.  To open the window part way, push the window switch down briefly, without going past the detent, and release it when you want the window to stop.  To stop the window from going all the way down during the Auto-Down operation, pull up on the switch briefly.  WARNING: There is no anti-pinch protection when the window is almost closed.

      "question": "Any tips about how to keep the air inside fresh?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the given context, here are some tips to help keep the air inside the vehicle fresh:\n\n1. Maintain the outside air intake: Ensure the air intake located in front of the windshield is free of obstructions, such as leaves. Blocked air intake can reduce airflow and potentially lead to issues like water drains getting plugged.\n\n2. Avoid excessive recirculation: Refrain from using the recirculation mode for extended periods without the air conditioning (A/C) on. Prolonged use of recirculation mode can lead to fogging and poor air quality inside the vehicle.\n\n3. Use the climate control system effectively: Utilize the Defrost or Mix mode and increase the front blower speed to clear any fogging on the windows. This helps maintain good visibility and air circulation.\n\n4. Manage the A/C system: If the A/C performance seems lower than expected, check the front of the A/C condenser (located in front of the radiator) for any dirt or insect accumulation. Clean the condenser with a gentle water spray to improve the A/C's effectiveness.\n\n5. Avoid excessive engine heat buildup: If the engine is experiencing severe and abnormal overheating, stop the vehicle, turn off the engine, and allow it to cool. Seek immediate service and a tune-up to manufacturer's specifications to address the issue, as this can help maintain proper air quality and prevent any potential odors.\n\nBy following these tips, you can help keep the air inside the vehicle fresh and improve the overall cabin environment.",
      "generated_response": "Here are a few practical steps\u2014drawn directly from the vehicle\u2011climate guidelines\u2014to keep the cabin air clean and fresh:\n\n1. **Keep the outside\u2011air intake clear**  \n   * The intake is right in front of the windshield. Make sure it isn\u2019t blocked by leaves, snow, ice or slush. A clean intake lets fresh outside air flow into the HVAC system and prevents debris from reaching the air\u2011distribution box where it could clog the water drains.\n\n2. **Use the proper ventilation mode**  \n   * For most of the drive, select the **\u201cFresh\u2011air\u201d (outside) mode** rather than the Recirculation mode. Recirculation is useful for a short period when you need rapid cooling or heating, but leaving it on for a long time can let humidity build up and cause fogging, which also means the cabin air gets stale.  \n   * If the windows start to fog, switch to **Defrost or Mix mode**, increase the front blower speed, and keep the A/C compressor running (even in cold weather) \u2013 the A/C acts as a de\u2011humidifier and helps pull moisture out of the cabin air.\n\n3. **Run the A/C compressor when needed**  \n   * Even in winter, a brief burst of A/C (with the temperature set to a comfortable level) will remove moisture and odors from the interior. This prevents the \u201cstale\u2011air\u201d feeling and reduces the chance of fog on the windshield.\n\n4. **Maintain the HVAC system**  \n   * Periodically inspect the front of the A/C condenser (located just ahead of the radiator). Dirt, insects or other debris can reduce airflow and the overall efficiency of the system, which in turn can affect how well fresh air is drawn in. A gentle water spray from the front of the radiator through the condenser is sufficient for cleaning.  \n   * Keep the cabin\u2011air filter (if equipped) clean or replace it according to the manufacturer\u2019s service schedule",

        " Outside Air Intake Make sure the air intake, located directly in front of the windshield, is free of obstructions, such as leaves.  Leaves collected in the air intake may reduce airflow, and if they enter the air distribution box, they could plug the water drains.  In Winter months, make sure the air intake is clear of ice, slush, and snow.\n\n Window Fogging Vehicle windows tend to fog on the inside in mild, rainy, and/or humid weather.  To clear the windows, select Defrost or Mix mode and increase the front blower speed.  Do not use the Recirculation mode without A/C for long periods, as fogging may occur.\n\n On the highways \u2014 slow down.  In city traffic \u2014 while stopped, place the transmission in NEUTRAL (N), but do not increase the engine idle speed while preventing vehicle motion with the brakes.  If your Air Conditioner (A/C) is on, turn it off.  The A/C system adds heat to the engine cooling system and turning the A/C off can help remove this heat.  You can also turn the temperature control to maximum heat, the mode control to floor and the blower control to high.  This allows the heater core to act as a supplement to the radiator and aids in removing heat from the engine cooling system.  For Manual Climate Controls, if the system is in Mix, Floor or Defrost Mode, the A/C can be turned off, but the A/C system shall remain active to prevent fogging of the windows.  If fog or mist appears on the windshield or side glass, select Defrost mode, and increase blower speed if needed.  If your air conditioning performance seems lower than expected, check the front of the A/C condenser (located in front of the radiator), for an accumulation of dirt or insects.  Clean with a gentle water spray from the front of the radiator and through the condenser.  In unusual situations involving grossly malfunctioning engine operation, a scorching odor may suggest severe and abnormal catalyst overheating.  If this occurs, stop the vehicle, turn off the engine and allow it to cool.  Service, including a tune-up to manufacturer's specifications, should be obtained immediately."

This vehicle has a higher ground clearance and a higher center of gravity than many passenger vehicles.  It is capable of performing better in a wide variety of off-road applications.  Driven in an unsafe manner, all vehicles can go out of control.  Because of the higher center of gravity, if this vehicle is out of control it may roll over while some other vehicles may not.  Do not attempt sharp turns, abrupt maneuvers, or other unsafe driving actions that can cause loss of vehicle control.  Failure to operate this vehicle safely may result in a collision, rollover of the vehicle, and severe or fatal injury.  Drive carefully.  Failure to use the driver and passenger seat belts provided is a major cause of severe or fatal injury.  In fact, the US government notes that the universal use of existing seat belts could cut the highway death toll by 10,000 or more each year and could reduce disabling injuries by two million annually.

You have full responsibility and assume all risks related to the use of the features and applications in this vehicle.  Only use the features and applications in this vehicle when it is safe to do so.  Failure to comply may result in an accident involving in serious injury or death.\n\n ROLLOVER WARNING Utility vehicles have a significantly higher rollover rate than other types of vehicles.  This vehicle has a higher ground clearance and a higher center of gravity than many passenger vehicles.  It is capable of performing better in a wide variety of off-road applications.  Driven in an unsafe manner, all vehicles can go out of control.  Because of the higher center of gravity, if this vehicle is out of control it may roll over while some other vehicles may not.  Do not attempt sharp turns, abrupt maneuvers, or other unsafe driving actions that can cause loss of vehicle control.  Failure to operate this vehicle safely may result in a collision, rollover of the vehicle, and severe or fatal injury.  Drive carefully.  Failure to use the driver and passenger seat belts provided is a major cause of severe or fatal injury.  In fact, the US government notes that the universal use of existing seat belts could cut the highway death toll by 10,000 or more each year and could reduce disabling injuries by two million annually.  In a rollover crash, an unbelted person is significantly more likely to die than a person wearing a seat belt.  Always buckle up."

You also may experience the following normal characteristics when the ABS activates: If the ABS Warning Light is on, the brake system should be serviced as soon as possible to restore the benefits of Anti-Lock Brakes.  If the ABS Warning Light does not come on when the ignition is placed in the ON/RUN mode, have the light repaired as soon as possible.  This warning light monitors the ABS.  The light will turn on when the ignition is placed in the ON/RUN or ACC/ON/RUN position and may stay on for as long as four seconds.  The yellow ABS Warning Light will turn on when the ignition is placed in the ON/RUN mode and may stay on for as long as four seconds.  Vehicles equipped with the Anti-Lock Brake System (ABS) are also equipped with Electronic Brake Force Distribution (EBD).  In the event of an EBD failure, the Brake Warning Light will turn on along with the ABS Light.  Immediate repair to the ABS system is required.  If the ABS light does not turn on when the ignition is placed in the ON/RUN or ACC/ON/RUN position, have the brake system inspected by an authorized dealer.  The ABS performs a self-check cycle to ensure that the ABS is working properly each time the vehicle is started and driven.  During this self-check, you may hear a slight clicking sound, as well as some related motor noises.  The ABS provides increased vehicle stability and brake performance under most braking conditions.  The system automatically prevents wheel lock and enhances vehicle control during braking.  The BAS is designed to optimize the vehicle\u2019s braking capability during emergency braking maneuvers.  The system detects an emergency braking situation by sensing the rate and amount of brake application, and then applies optimum pressure to the brakes.  This can help reduce braking distances.  The BAS complements the Anti-Lock Brake System (ABS) by applying the brakes very quickly, creating the most efficient braking assistance possible.  To receive the benefit of the system, you must apply continuous braking pressure during the stopping sequence (do not \u201cpump\u201d the brakes).  Do not reduce brake pedal pressure unless braking is no longer desired.

      "question": "What should I pay attention to for the clutch pedal?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the provided context, here are the key things to pay attention to regarding the clutch pedal:\n\n1. Fully press the clutch pedal before shifting gears. Pressing the clutch pedal all the way down is necessary when changing gears to prevent damage to the transmission.\n\n2. As you release the clutch pedal, lightly press the accelerator pedal. This coordination of the clutch and accelerator is important for smooth gear shifts.\n\n3. Certain noise from the transmission may be noticeable when the clutch is engaged (pedal released). This noise is normal and not an indication of a problem with the clutch or transmission.\n\n4. Ensure the carpet is securely attached and does not interfere with the operation of the clutch pedal. Unattached or improperly placed carpet could get stuck under the clutch pedal and cause a loss of vehicle control.\n\nIn summary, focus on fully pressing and properly releasing the clutch pedal during gear shifts, be aware of normal transmission noises, and ensure the floor carpet does not impact clutch pedal operation.",
      "generated_response": "**Clutch\u2011pedal checklist**\n\n1. **Full depression before any shift** \u2013 Always press the clutch pedal all the way down before moving the shifter.  This disengages the clutch and protects the transmission.\n\n2. **Smooth release** \u2013 When you begin to let the clutch out, do it gradually and at the same time give the accelerator a light \u201ctouch\u2011down.\u201d  This prevents stalling and gives a smooth power transfer.\n\n3. **No interference from floor\u2011coverings**  \n   * Use only the carpet that is designed for your vehicle.  \n   * Make sure the carpet is securely fastened with its grommets so it can\u2019t shift or fold under the pedals.  \n   * Verify that nothing (towels, keys, loose objects, damaged grommets, etc.) is lying under or between the carpet and the clutch pedal.\n\n4. **Pedal travel check** \u2013 After installing or re\u2011installing carpet, fully depress the clutch (and the other pedals) to confirm that the pedal moves freely and isn\u2019t being blocked or altered in its range of motion.\n\n5. **Safety warning** \u2013 A mis\u2011aligned or loose carpet can cause the clutch pedal to stick, leading to loss of control.  Always double\u2011check the carpet\u2019s attachment and clear the floor area before driving.\n\nBy keeping the clutch pedal fully depressed when shifting, releasing it smoothly, and ensuring the floor carpet does not impede its movement, you\u2019ll maintain proper clutch operation and avoid potential safety issues.",

        " Shifting Fully press the clutch pedal before shifting gears.  As you release the clutch pedal, lightly press the accelerator pedal.  You should always use FIRST gear when starting from a standing position.  Note: A certain amount of noise from the transmission is normal.  This noise can be most noticeable when the vehicle is idling in NEUTRAL with the clutch engaged (clutch pedal released), but it may also be heard when driving.  The noise may also be more noticeable when the transmission is warm.  This noise is normal and is not an indication of a problem with your clutch or transmission.\n\n Before Climbing A Steep Hill As you approach a hill, consider its grade or steepness.  Determine if it is too steep.  Look to see what the traction is on the hill side trail.  Is the trail straight up and down?  What is on top and the other side?  Are there ruts, rocks, branches or other obstacles on the path?  Can you safely recover the vehicle if something goes wrong?  If everything looks good and you feel confident, shift the transmission into a lower gear with 4L engaged, and proceed with caution, maintaining your momentum as you climb the hill.\n\n Carpet Safety Information Always use carpet designed to fit your vehicle.  Only use carpet that does not interfere with the operation of the pedal assemblies.  Only operate the vehicle when the carpet is securely attached by the grommets so it cannot slip out of position and interfere with the pedal assemblies or impair safe operation of your vehicle in other ways.  WARNING: If operating the vehicle without carpet in place the floor may become hot, and there is a risk of burns.  An improperly attached, damaged, folded, or damaged grommets may cause your carpet to interfere with the accelerator, brake, or clutch pedals and cause a loss of vehicle control.  To prevent SERIOUS INJURY or DEATH: ALWAYS securely attach your carpet using the grommets.  ALWAYS make sure objects cannot fall or slide into the driver\u2019s side floor area when the vehicle is moving.  Objects can become trapped under accelerator, brake, or clutch pedals and could cause a loss of vehicle control.  NEVER place any objects under the carpet (e.g., towels, keys, etc.).  These objects could change the position of the carpet and may cause interference with the accelerator, brake, or clutch pedals.  ONLY install carpet designed to fit your vehicle.  NEVER install carpet that cannot be properly attached and secured to your vehicle.  If the carpet needs to be replaced, only use manufacturer approved carpet for the specific make, model, and year of your vehicle.  If the vehicle carpet has been removed and re-installed, always properly attach carpet to the floor and check that the floor mat fasteners are secure to the vehicle carpet.  Fully depress each pedal to check for interference with the accelerator, brake, or clutch pedals then re-install the floor mats."

      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the provided context, it seems that the ability to deactivate the Daytime Running Lights (DRLs) depends on the specific vehicle and the market it is sold in.\n\nFor vehicles sold in Canada, the context indicates that the headlight switch does not have an \"OFF\" detent. Instead, the headlights will be deactivated when the headlight switch is placed in the parking lights position. However, the DRLs will still be activated along with the front and rear marker lights in this scenario.\n\nThe context also mentions that the DRLs may be deactivated when the parking brake is engaged, and that for vehicles sold in Canada, the DRLs will automatically deactivate when the front fog lights are turned on.\n\nAdditionally, the context states that on some vehicles, the Daytime Running Lights may deactivate or reduce intensity on one side of the vehicle when a turn signal is activated on that side, or on both sides of the vehicle when the hazard warning lights are activated.\n\nHowever, the context does not explicitly state that the DRLs can be manually deactivated by the driver. The information provided suggests that the ability to deactivate the DRLs may be limited or controlled by the vehicle's design and features, rather than being a user-configurable option.\n\nTherefore, based on the given context, it is not clear if the DRLs can be deactivated by the driver. The ability to deactivate them may depend on the specific vehicle model and market regulations.",

      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the given context, here are some tips to help keep the air inside the vehicle fresh:\n\n1. Maintain the outside air intake: Ensure the air intake located in front of the windshield is free of obstructions, such as leaves. Blocked air intake can reduce airflow and potentially lead to issues like water drains getting plugged.\n\n2. Avoid excessive recirculation: Refrain from using the recirculation mode for extended periods without the air conditioning (A/C) on. Prolonged use of recirculation mode can lead to fogging and poor air quality inside the vehicle.\n\n3. Use the climate control system effectively: Utilize the Defrost or Mix mode and increase the front blower speed to clear any fogging on the windows. This helps maintain good visibility and air circulation.\n\n4. Manage the A/C system: If the A/C performance seems lower than expected, check the front of the A/C condenser (located in front of the radiator) for any dirt or insect accumulation. Clean the condenser with a gentle water spray to improve the A/C's effectiveness.\n\n5. Avoid excessive engine heat buildup: If the engine is experiencing severe and abnormal overheating, stop the vehicle, turn off the engine, and allow it to cool. Seek immediate service and a tune-up to manufacturer's specifications to address the issue, as this can help maintain proper air quality and prevent any potential odors.\n\nBy following these tips, you can help keep the air inside the vehicle fresh and improve the overall cabin environment.",
      "generated_response": "Here are a few practical steps\u2014drawn directly from the vehicle\u2011climate guidelines\u2014to keep the cabin air clean and fresh:\n\n1. **Keep the outside\u2011air intake clear**  \n   * The intake is right in front of the windshield. Make sure it isn\u2019t blocked by leaves, snow, ice or slush. A clean intake lets fresh outside air flow into the HVAC system and prevents debris from reaching the air\u2011distribution box where it could clog the water drains.\n\n2. **Use the proper ventilation mode**  \n   * For most of the drive, select the **\u201cFresh\u2011air\u201d (outside\u2011air) mode** rather than the Recirculation mode.  \n   * **Avoid long periods in Recirculation without the A/C** \u2013 doing so can let humidity build up inside the cabin and cause fogging, which is a sign that the interior air is getting stale.\n\n3. **Run the A/C (even in cold weather) when needed**  \n   * The air\u2011conditioner acts as a de\u2011humidifier. If you notice the windows fogging, turn the A/C on while the system is in Defrost or Mix mode; the drier air will clear the glass and also help remove moisture from the cabin air.\n\n4. **Maintain the HVAC filters**  \n   * Although not explicitly mentioned in the excerpt, a clean cabin\u2011air filter is essential for fresh air. Replace it according to the manufacturer\u2019s schedule or sooner if you drive in dusty or pollen\u2011heavy environments.\n\n5. **Keep the condenser and radiator clean**  \n   * If the A/C feels weak, spray the front of the condenser (located just ahead of the radiator) with a gentle water stream to clear dirt or insects. A clean condenser improves overall A/C performance, which in turn helps keep interior air dry and fresh.\n\n6. **Avoid unnecessary heat buildup**  \n   * When stopped in traffic, shift to **Neutral (N)**, turn the A/C off,",

        " Outside Air Intake Make sure the air intake, located directly in front of the windshield, is free of obstructions, such as leaves.  Leaves collected in the air intake may reduce airflow, and if they enter the air distribution box, they could plug the water drains.  In Winter months, make sure the air intake is clear of ice, slush, and snow.\n\n Window Fogging Vehicle windows tend to fog on the inside in mild, rainy, and/or humid weather.  To clear the windows, select Defrost or Mix mode and increase the front blower speed.  Do not use the Recirculation mode without A/C for long periods, as fogging may occur.\n\n On the highways \u2014 slow down.  In city traffic \u2014 while stopped, place the transmission in NEUTRAL (N), but do not increase the engine idle speed while preventing vehicle motion with the brakes.  If your Air Conditioner (A/C) is on, turn it off.  The A/C system adds heat to the engine cooling system and turning the A/C off can help remove this heat.  You can also turn the temperature control to maximum heat, the mode control to floor and the blower control to high.  This allows the heater core to act as a supplement to the radiator and aids in removing heat from the engine cooling system.  For Manual Climate Controls, if the system is in Mix, Floor or Defrost Mode, the A/C can be turned off, but the A/C system shall remain active to prevent fogging of the windows.  If fog or mist appears on the windshield or side glass, select Defrost mode, and increase blower speed if needed.  If your air conditioning performance seems lower than expected, check the front of the A/C condenser (located in front of the radiator), for an accumulation of dirt or insects.  Clean with a gentle water spray from the front of the radiator and through the condenser.  In unusual situations involving grossly malfunctioning engine operation, a scorching odor may suggest severe and abnormal catalyst overheating.  If this occurs, stop the vehicle, turn off the engine and allow it to cool.  Service, including a tune-up to manufacturer's specifications, should be obtained immediately."

You also may experience the following normal characteristics when the ABS activates: If the ABS Warning Light is on, the brake system should be serviced as soon as possible to restore the benefits of Anti-Lock Brakes.  If the ABS Warning Light does not come on when the ignition is placed in the ON/RUN mode, have the light repaired as soon as possible.  This warning light monitors the ABS.  The light will turn on when the ignition is placed in the ON/RUN or ACC/ON/RUN position and may stay on for as long as four seconds.  The yellow ABS Warning Light will turn on when the ignition is placed in the ON/RUN mode and may stay on for as long as four seconds.  Vehicles equipped with the Anti-Lock Brake System (ABS) are also equipped with Electronic Brake Force Distribution (EBD).  In the event of an EBD failure, the Brake Warning Light will turn on along with the ABS Light.  Immediate repair to the ABS system is required.  If the ABS light does not turn on when the ignition is placed in the ON/RUN or ACC/ON/RUN position, have the brake system inspected by an authorized dealer.  The ABS performs a self-check cycle to ensure that the ABS is working properly each time the vehicle is started and driven.  During this self-check, you may hear a slight clicking sound, as well as some related motor noises.  The ABS provides increased vehicle stability and brake performance under most braking conditions.  The system automatically prevents wheel lock and enhances vehicle control during braking.  The BAS is designed to optimize the vehicle\u2019s braking capability during emergency braking maneuvers.  The system detects an emergency braking situation by sensing the rate and amount of brake application, and then applies optimum pressure to the brakes.  This can help reduce braking distances.  The BAS complements the Anti-Lock Brake System (ABS) by applying the brakes very quickly, creating the most efficient braking assistance possible.  To receive the benefit of the system, you must apply continuous braking pressure during the stopping sequence (do not \u201cpump\u201d the brakes).  Do not reduce brake pedal pressure unless braking is no longer desired.

The ABS contains sophisticated electronic equipment that may be susceptible to interference caused by improperly installed or high output radio transmitting equipment.  This interference can cause possible loss of anti-lock braking capability.  Installation of such equipment should be performed by qualified professionals.  Pumping of the Anti-Lock Brakes will diminish their effectiveness and may lead to a collision.  Pumping makes the stopping distance longer.

To lock all the doors, push the lock button once.  When the doors are unlocked, the turn signals will flash and the illuminated entry system will be activated.  When the doors are locked, the turn signals will flash and the horn will chirp.  Note: All doors can be programmed to unlock on the first push of the unlock button through Uconnect Settings The mechanical flip key can be used to lock or unlock the doors, tailgate, glove compartment, storage compartments (if equipped), and rear seatbacks.\n\n When any of these situations occur, after all open doors are closed, the FOBIK-Safe search will be executed.  If it detects a Passive Entry key fob inside the vehicle, the vehicle will unlock and alert the customer.  If Passive Entry is disabled using the Uconnect system, the key fob protection described in this section remains active/functional.  When a door is open and the interior lights are on, rotating the instrument panel dimmer control to the extreme bottom position will cause all the interior lights to turn off.  This allows the doors to stay open for extended periods of time without discharging the vehicle\u2019s battery.  Be sure the hood is fully latched before driving your vehicle.  If the hood is not fully latched, it could open when the vehicle is in motion and block your vision.  Failure to follow this warning could result in serious injury or death.  The doors have to be open and then closed in order for the vehicle to check for the presence of a key fob; the Key Left Vehicle feature will not activate until all of the doors are closed.  These alerts will not be activated in situations where the vehicle\u2019s engine is left running with the key fob inside.\n\n Your vehicle is equipped with a key fob which supports Passive Entry, Remote Keyless Entry (RKE), Keyless Enter \u2018n Go\u2122 (if equipped), and Remote Start (if equipped).  The key fob allows you to lock or unlock the doors and tailgate from distances up to approximately 66 ft (20 m).  The key fob does not need to be pointed at the vehicle to activate the system.  The key fob also contains a mechanical key.  When any of these situations occur, after all open doors are closed, the FOBIK-Safe search will be executed.  If it detects a Passive Entry key fob inside the vehicle, the vehicle will unlock and alert the customer.  If Passive Entry is disabled using the Uconnect system, the key fob protection described in this section remains active/functional.  The electrical components inside of the key fob may be damaged if the key fob is subjected to strong electrical shocks.  In order to ensure complete effectiveness of the electronic devices inside of the key fob, avoid exposing the key fob to direct sunlight.  Once a key fob is programmed to a vehicle, it cannot be repurposed and reprogrammed to another vehicle.  Only key fobs that are programmed to the vehicle electronics can be used to start and operate the vehicle.  Once a key fob is programmed to a vehicle, it cannot be programmed to any other vehicle.  The system uses a key fob, keyless push button ignition and a Radio Frequency (RF) receiver to prevent unauthorized vehicle operation.

Push the lock button on the exterior Passive Entry door handle with a valid key fob available in the same exterior zone Push the lock button on the key fob.  If any doors are open, close them.  Note: The Vehicle Security system will not arm if you lock the doors using the manual door lock.  VEHICLE SECURITY SYSTEM \u2014 IF EQUIPPED The Vehicle Security system monitors the vehicle doors for unauthorized entry and the ignition switch for unauthorized operation.  When the system is activated, the interior switches for door locks are disabled.  The Vehicle Security system provides both audible and visible signals.  If something triggers the alarm, the Vehicle Security system will provide the following audible and visible signals: the horn will pulse, the parking lights and/or turn signals will flash, and the Vehicle Security Light in the instrument cluster will flash.  SENTRY KEY The Sentry Key Immobilizer system prevents unauthorized vehicle operation by disabling the engine.  The system does not need to be armed or activated.  Operation is automatic, regardless of whether the vehicle is locked or unlocked.  The system uses a key fob, keyless push button ignition and a Radio Frequency (RF) receiver to prevent unauthorized vehicle operation.  Therefore, only key fobs that are programmed to the vehicle can be used to start and operate the vehicle.  The system cannot reprogram a key fob obtained from another vehicle.  After placing the ignition switch in the ON/RUN position, the Vehicle Security Light will turn on for three seconds for a bulb check.  If the light remains on after the bulb check, it indicates that there is a problem with the electronics.  In addition, if the light begins to flash after the bulb check, it indicates that someone attempted to start the engine with an invalid key fob.  In the event that a valid key fob is used to start the engine but there is an issue with the vehicle electronics, the engine will start and shut off after two seconds.  If the Vehicle Security Light turns on during normal vehicle operation (vehicle running for longer than ten seconds), it indicates that there is a fault in the electronics.  Should this occur, have the vehicle serviced as soon as possible by an authorized dealer.  All of the key fobs provided with your new vehicle have been programmed to the vehicle electronics CAUTION: The Sentry Key Immobilizer system is not compatible with some aftermarket remote starting systems.  Use of these systems may result in vehicle starting problems and loss of security protection.  Note: A key fob that has not been programmed is also considered an invalid key.\n\n To Disarm The System The Vehicle Security system can be disarmed using any of the following methods: Push the unlock button on the key fob.  Grab the Passive Entry door handle (if equipped) Cycle the vehicle ignition system out of the OFF position.  The Vehicle Security system is designed to protect your vehicle.  However, you can create conditions where the system will give you a false alarm.  If one of the previously described arming sequences has occurred, the Vehicle Security system will arm regardless of whether you are in the vehicle or not.  If you remain in the vehicle and open a door, the alarm will sound.  If this occurs, disarm the Vehicle Security system.  If the Vehicle Security system is armed and the battery becomes disconnected, the Vehicle Security system will remain armed when the battery is reconnected; the exterior lights will flash, and the horn will sound.  If this occurs, disarm the Vehicle Security system.  Note: The driver's door key cylinder cannot arm or disarm the Vehicle Security system.  When the Vehicle Security system is armed, the interior power door lock switches will not unlock the doors.  Vehicle Security Warning Light \u2014 If Equipped This light will flash at a fast rate for approximately 15 seconds when the vehicle security system is arming, and then will flash slowly until the vehicle is disarmed.  Rearming Of The System If something triggers the alarm and no action is taken to disarm it, the Vehicle Security system will turn the horn off after a 29 second cycle (with five seconds between cycles and up to eight cycles if the trigger remains active) and then rearm itself."

GVWR GTW GAWR Tongue weight rating for the trailer hitch utilized Position the truck to be ready to connect to the trailer (do not connect the trailer).  Measure the height from the top of the front fender to ground, this is height H1.  Measuring Height (H) Attach the trailer to the vehicle without the weight distribution bars connected.  Measure the height from the top of the front fender to ground, this is height H2.  Install and adjust the tension in the weight distributing bars per the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations so that the height of the front fender is approximately H1 (H2=H1).  The truck can now be driven.\n\n Gross Combination Weight Rating (GCWR) The GCWR is the total permissible weight of your vehicle and trailer when weighed in combination.  Trailer And Tongue Weight Never exceed the maximum tongue weight stamped on your bumper or trailer hitch.  Consider the following items when computing the weight on the rear axle of the vehicle: the tongue weight of the trailer the weight of any other type of cargo or equipment put in or on your vehicle the weight of the driver and all passengers note: remember that everything put into or on the trailer adds to the load on your vehicle.  Also, additional factory-installed options or dealer-installed options must be considered as part of the total load on your vehicle.  Refer to the Tire And Loading Information Placard for the maximum combined weight of occupants and cargo for your vehicle.  Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR) The GVWR is the total permissible weight of your vehicle including driver, passengers, vehicle, options and cargo.

        " Shifting Fully press the clutch pedal before shifting gears.  As you release the clutch pedal, lightly press the accelerator pedal.  You should always use FIRST gear when starting from a standing position.  Note: A certain amount of noise from the transmission is normal.  This noise can be most noticeable when the vehicle is idling in NEUTRAL with the clutch engaged (clutch pedal released), but it may also be heard when driving.  The noise may also be more noticeable when the transmission is warm.  This noise is normal and is not an indication of a problem with your clutch or transmission.\n\n Automatic Transmission \u2014 If Equipped\n\n Transmission function is monitored electronically for abnormal conditions.  If a condition is detected that could result in transmission damage, Transmission Limp Home mode is activated.  In this mode, the transmission may operate only in certain gears, or may not shift at all.  Vehicle performance may be severely degraded and the engine may stall.  In some situations, the transmission may not re-engage if the engine is turned off and restarted.  The Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) may be illuminated.  A message in the instrument cluster will inform the driver of the more serious conditions, and indicate what actions may be necessary.  It is important to use the proper transmission fluid to ensure optimum transmission performance and life.  Use only manufacturer's specified transmission fluid It is important to maintain the transmission fluid at the correct level using the recommended fluid.  Using a transmission fluid other than manufacturer\u2019s recommended fluid may cause deterioration in transmission shift quality and/or torque converter shudder Continuous driving with the Transmission Temperature Warning Light illuminated will eventually cause severe transmission damage or transmission failure.  If you continue to operate the vehicle when the CLUTCH HOT message is displayed or Transmission Temperature Warning Light is illuminated, you could cause the clutch to overheat and cause severe clutch damage, transmission damage or failure.  Using a lower gear while operating the vehicle under heavy loading conditions, will improve performance and extend transmission life by reducing excessive shifting and heat build-up.  This action will also provide better engine braking.  Towing the vehicle, coasting, or driving for any other reason with the transmission in NEUTRAL can cause severe transmission damage.  For Recreational Towing For Towing A Disabled Vehicle When frequent transmission shifting occurs (such as when operating the vehicle under heavy loading conditions, in hilly terrain, traveling into strong head winds, or while towing a heavy trailer), use the AutoStick shift control to select a lower gear Under these conditions, using a lower gear will improve performance and extend transmission life by reducing excessive shifting and heat build-up.  Racing the engine or spinning the wheels may lead to transmission overheating and failure.  Allow the engine to idle with the transmission in NEUTRAL (N) for at least one minute after every five rocking-motion cycles.  This will minimize overheating and reduce the risk of clutch or transmission failure during prolonged efforts to free a stuck vehicle.  When \u201crocking\u201d a stuck vehicle by shifting between DRIVE/SECOND gear and REVERSE, do not spin the wheels faster than 15 mph (24 km/h), or drivetrain damage may result.  Revving the engine or spinning the wheels too fast may lead to transmission overheating and failure.  It can also damage the tires.  Do not spin the wheels above 30 mph (48 km/h) while in gear (no transmission shifting occurring).  During cold weather, you may experience increased effort in shifting until the transmission fluid warms up.  This is normal.  Routine fluid and filter changes are not required.  However, change the fluid and filter if the fluid becomes contaminated (with water, etc.  ), or if the transmission is disassembled for any reason."

Check function of all interior and exterior lights What to do when an electrical load reduction action message is present (\u201cbattery saver on\u201d or \u201cbattery saver mode\u201d) during a trip: reduce power to unnecessary loads if possible: turn off redundant lights (interior or exterior) check what may be plugged in to power outlets +12 volt, 115 volts ac, usb ports check hvac settings (blower, temperature) check the audio settings (volume) after a trip: check if any aftermarket equipment was installed (additional lights, upfitter electrical accessories, audio systems, alarms) and review specifications if any (load and ignition off draw currents).  Evaluate the latest driving cycles (distance, driving time and parking time).  The vehicle should have service performed if the message is still present during consecutive trips and the evaluation of the vehicle and driving pattern did not help to identify the cause.\n\n Never use the PARK position as a substitute for the parking brake.  Always apply the parking brake fully when exiting the vehicle to guard against vehicle movement and possible injury or damage.  Your vehicle could move and injure you and others if it is not in PARK.  Check by trying to move the transmission gear selector out of PARK with the brake pedal released.  Make sure the transmission is in PARK before exiting the vehicle.  The transmission may not engage PARK if the vehicle is moving.  Always bring the vehicle to a complete stop before shifting to PARK, and verify that the transmission gear position indicator solidly indicates PARK (P) without blinking.  Ensure that the vehicle is completely stopped, and the PARK position is properly indicated, before exiting the vehicle.  It is dangerous to shift out of PARK or NEUTRAL if the engine speed is higher than idle speed.  If your foot is not firmly pressing the brake pedal, the vehicle could accelerate quickly forward or in reverse.  You could lose control of the vehicle and hit someone or something.  Only shift into gear when the engine is idling normally and your foot is firmly pressing the brake pedal.  Unintended movement of a vehicle could injure those in or near the vehicle.  As with all vehicles, you should never exit a vehicle while the engine is running.  Before exiting a vehicle, always come to a complete stop, then apply the parking brake, shift the transmission into PARK, and turn the ignition OFF.  When the ignition is in the OFF position, the transmission is locked in PARK, securing the vehicle against unwanted movement.  When exiting the vehicle, always make sure the ignition is in the OFF position, remove the key fob from the vehicle, and lock the vehicle.  Never leave children alone in a vehicle, or with access to an unlocked vehicle.  Allowing children to be in a vehicle unattended is dangerous for a number of reasons.  A child or others could be seriously or fatally injured.  Children should be warned not to touch the parking brake, brake pedal or the transmission gear selector.  Do not leave the key fob in or near the vehicle (or in a location accessible to children), and do not leave the ignition in the ACC or ON/RUN position.  A child could operate power windows, other controls, or move the vehicle.  Always do a visual check that your vehicle is in park by looking for the \u201cp\u201d in the instrument cluster display and on the gear selector.  As an added precaution, always apply the parking brake when exiting the vehicle.  Check engine oil level.  Check windshield washer fluid level.  Check the tire pressures and look for unusual wear or damage, rotate at the first sign of irregular wear.  Check the fluid levels of the coolant reservoir, brake master cylinder, and power steering, and fill as needed.  Check function of all interior and exterior lights."

        " Off-Road Driving Tips\n\n The Basics Of Off-Road Driving You will encounter many types of terrain driving off-road.  You should be familiar with the terrain and area before proceeding.  There are many types of surface conditions: hard-packed dirt, gravel, rocks, grass, sand, mud, snow and ice.  Every surface has a different effect on your vehicle's steering, handling and traction.  Controlling your vehicle is one of the keys to successful off-road driving, so always keep a firm grip on the steering wheel and maintain a good driving posture.  Avoid sudden accelerations, turns or braking.  In most cases, there are no road signs, posted speed limits or signal lights.  Therefore, you will need to use your own good judgment on what is safe and what is not.  When on a trail, you should always be looking ahead for surface obstacles and changes in terrain.  The key is to plan your future driving route while remembering what you are currently driving over.  Note: It is recommended that the Stop/Start system be disabled during off-road use.  WARNING: Always wear your seat belt and firmly tie down cargo.  Unsecured cargo can become projectiles in an off-road situation.  CAUTION: Never park your vehicle over dry grass or other combustible materials.  The heat from your vehicle exhaust system could cause a fire.\n\n If you get hung up or high-centered on an object, get out of the vehicle and try to determine what the vehicle is hung up on, where it is contacting the underbody and what is the best direction to recover the vehicle.  Depending on what you are in contact with, jack the vehicle up and place a few rocks under the tires so the weight is off of the high point when you let the vehicle down.  You can also try rocking the vehicle or winching the vehicle off the object.  You will encounter many types of terrain driving off-road.

The key is to plan your future driving route while remembering what you are currently driving over.  As you approach a hill, consider its grade or steepness.  Determine if it is too steep.  Look to see what the traction is on the hill side trail.  Is the trail straight up and down?  What is on top and the other side?  Are there ruts, rocks, branches or other obstacles on the path?  Can you safely recover the vehicle if something goes wrong?  If everything looks good and you feel confident, shift the transmission into a lower gear with 4L engaged, and proceed with caution, maintaining your momentum as you climb the hill.  When approaching large rocks, choose a path which ensures you drive over the largest of them with your tires.  This will lift your undercarriage over the obstacle.  The tread of the tire is tougher and thicker than the side wall and is designed to take the abuse.  Always look ahead and make every effort to cross the large rocks with your tires."

Voice commands are required after most Uconnect Phone prompts.  There are two general methods for how Voice Command works: Prior to giving a voice command, one must wait for the beep, which follows the \u201cListen\u201d prompt or another prompt.  For certain operations, compound commands can be used.  For example, instead of saying \u201cCall\u201d and then \u201cJohn Smith\u201d and then \u201cmobile\u201d, the following compound command can be said: \u201cCall John Smith mobile.\u201d For each feature explanation in this section, only the compound command form of the voice command is given.  You can also break the commands into parts and say each part of the command when you are asked for it.  For example, you can use the compound command form voice command \u201cSearch for John Smith,\u201d or you can break the compound command form into two voice commands: \u201cSearch Contacts\u201d and when asked, \u201cJohn Smith.\u201d Please remember, the Uconnect Phone works best when you talk in a normal conversational tone, as if speaking to someone sitting a few feet/meters away from you.

      "ground_truth_answer": "The SOS Call button can be used to initiate a call to an SOS operator in case of an emergency. It will transmit important vehicle information such as the vehicle brand and last known GPS coordinates to the SOS operator. The button can also be used to speak with the SOS operator through the vehicle audio system to determine if additional help is needed. If the SOS operator opens a voice connection with the vehicle, they can communicate with the vehicle occupants and hear sounds occurring in the vehicle. Additionally, the SOS operator may contact appropriate emergency responders and provide them with important vehicle information and GPS coordinates. If necessary, the SOS operator may also be able to open a voice connection with the vehicle to provide assistance.",

        " In some localities, it may be a legal requirement to pass an inspection of your vehicle's emissions control system.  Failure to pass could prevent vehicle registration.  Do not inhale exhaust gases.  They contain carbon monoxide, a colorless and odorless gas, which can kill.  Never run the engine in a closed area, such as a garage, and never sit in a parked vehicle with the engine running for an extended period.  If the vehicle is stopped in an open area with the engine running for more than a short period, adjust the ventilation system to force fresh, outside air into the vehicle.  Guard against carbon monoxide with proper maintenance.  Have the exhaust system inspected every time the vehicle is raised.  Have any abnormal conditions repaired promptly.  Until repaired, drive with all side windows fully open.  Your vehicle is equipped with a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system to meet the very stringent diesel emissions standards required by the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\n EMISSIONS INSPECTION AND MAINTENANCE PROGRAMS In some localities, it may be a legal requirement to pass an inspection of your vehicle's emissions control system.  Failure to pass could prevent vehicle registration.  For states and/or provinces that require an Inspection and Maintenance (I/M), this check verifies the Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) is functioning and is not on when the engine is running, and that the OBD II system is ready for testing.  The obd ii system may not be ready if your vehicle was recently serviced, recently had a depleted battery or a battery replacement.  If the OBD II system should be determined not ready for the I/M test, your vehicle may fail the test.  Your vehicle has a simple ignition actuated test, which you can use prior to going to the test station.  To check if your vehicle's OBD II system is ready, you must do the following: Cycle the ignition switch to the ON position, but do not crank or start the engine.  Note: if you crank or start the engine, you will have to start this test over.  As soon as you cycle the ignition switch to the ON position, you will see the Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) symbol come on as part of a normal bulb check.  Approximately 15 seconds later, one of two things will happen: the mil will flash for about 10 seconds and then return to being fully illuminated until you turn off the ignition or start the engine.  This means that your vehicle's obd ii system is not ready and you should not proceed to the i/m station.  The MIL will not flash at all and will remain fully illuminated until you place the ignition in the off position or start the engine.  This means that your vehicle's obd ii system is ready and you can proceed to the i/m station.  If your obd ii system is not ready, you should see an authorized dealer or repair facility.

If your vehicle is not equipped, engine block heaters and heater cords are available from an authorized Mopar\u00ae dealer.  Power Outlets There is a 12 Volt (13 A) auxiliary power outlet that can provide power for accessories designed for use with the standard power outlet adapters.  The front power outlet is located in the center of the instrument panel below the climate controls, and is powered from the ignition switch.  Power is available when the ignition switch is in the ACC or ON/RUN position.  WARNING: To avoid serious injury or death: Do not insert any objects into the receptacles.  Do not touch with wet hands.  Close the lid when not in use.  If this outlet is mishandled, it may cause an electric shock and failure.  CAUTION: Do not exceed the maximum power of 160 W (13 A) at 12 Volts.  If the 160 W (13 A) power rating is exceeded, the fuse protecting the system will need to be replaced.  Power outlets are designed for accessory plugs only.  Do not insert any other object in the power outlets as this will damage the outlet and blow the fuse.  Improper use of the power outlet can cause damage not covered by your New Vehicle Limited Warranty.  Many accessories that can be plugged in draw power from the vehicle's battery, even when not in use (i.e., cellular phones, etc.).  Eventually, if plugged in long enough, the vehicle's battery will discharge sufficiently to degrade battery life and/or prevent the engine from starting.  Accessories that draw higher power (i.e., coolers, vacuum cleaners, lights, etc.  ), will degrade the battery even more quickly.  Only use these intermittently and with greater caution.  After the use of high power draw accessories, or long periods of the vehicle not being started (with accessories still plugged in), the vehicle must be driven a sufficient length of time to allow the alternator to recharge the vehicle's battery.  Power outlets are designed for accessory plugs only.  Do not hang any type of accessory or accessory bracket from the plug.  Improper use of the power outlet can cause damage Extreme Cold Weather (Below \u201322\u00b0F Or \u221230\u00b0C) To ensure reliable starting at these temperatures, use of an externally powered electric engine block heater (available from an authorized dealer) is recommended.\n\n The cartridge block heater clips into the engine block near the water jacket and transfers heat to the coolant.

Whenever a change is noticed in the sound of the exhaust system, when exhaust fumes can be detected inside the vehicle, or when the underside or rear of the vehicle is damaged, have an authorized dealer inspect the complete exhaust system and adjacent body areas for broken, damaged, deteriorated, or mispositioned parts.  Open seams or loose connections could permit exhaust fumes to seep into the passenger compartment.  In addition, inspect the exhaust system each time the vehicle is raised for lubrication or oil change.  Replace as required.  WARNING: Exhaust gases can injure or kill.  They contain carbon monoxide (CO), which is colorless and odorless.  Breathing it can make you unconscious and can eventually poison you.  To avoid breathing (CO), follow these safety tips: Do not run the engine in a closed garage or in confined areas any longer than needed to move your vehicle in or out of the area.  If you are required to drive with the trunk/liftgate/rear doors open, make sure that all windows are closed and the climate control BLOWER switch is set at high speed.  DO NOT use the recirculation mode.  If it is necessary to sit in a parked vehicle with the engine running, adjust your heating or cooling controls to force outside air into the vehicle.  Set the blower at high speed.  Carbon Monoxide Warnings WARNING: Carbon monoxide (CO) in exhaust gases is deadly.  Follow the precautions below to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning: Do not inhale exhaust gases.  They contain carbon monoxide, a colorless and odorless gas, which can kill.  Never run the engine in a closed area, such as a garage, and never sit in a parked vehicle with the engine running for an extended period.  If the vehicle is stopped in an open area with the engine running for more than a short period, adjust the ventilation system to force fresh, outside air into the vehicle.  Guard against carbon monoxide with proper maintenance.  Have the exhaust system inspected every time the vehicle is raised.  Have any abnormal conditions repaired promptly.  Until repaired, drive with all side windows fully open.  Charge Air Cooler \u2014 Inter-Cooler (Diesel Engine) The charge air cooler is positioned in front of the radiator and the air conditioner condenser.  Air enters the engine through the air cleaner and passes through the turbocharger, where it is pressurized.  This pressurized air rapidly reaches high temperature.  The air is then directed through a hose to the charge air cooler and through another hose to the intake manifold of the engine.  This cooling process enables more efficient burning of fuel resulting in fewer emissions.  To guarantee optimum performance of the system, keep the surfaces of the charge air cooler, condenser and radiator clean and free of debris.  Periodically check the hoses leading to and from the charge air cooler for cracks or loose clamps resulting in loss of pressure and reduced engine performance."

      "generated_response": "**Tips for crossing an incline safely**\n\n1. **Avoid it if you can** \u2013 The safest option is to take a route that goes up or down the slope instead of straight across.  \n\n2. **Know your vehicle\u2019s limits** \u2013 Make sure the vehicle is rated for the grade and that you\u2019re in the proper gear (often 4\u2011low for off\u2011road trucks).  \n\n3. **Check the surface** \u2013 Only cross if the ground is firm, stable and has good traction (dry, compacted soil, packed gravel, etc.).  \n\n4. **Cross at an angle** \u2013 Instead of a 90\u2011degree traverse, aim to go slightly up\u2011 or downhill (a shallow angle) so the weight is more evenly distributed between the wheels.  \n\n5. **Keep the wheels planted** \u2013 Maintain steady, moderate throttle; avoid sudden acceleration or braking that could lift the uphill wheels.  \n\n6. **Watch for rollover risk** \u2013 Because the downhill wheels carry more weight, the vehicle is more prone to sliding or rolling over. Keep your speed low, your steering smooth, and be ready to correct quickly.  \n\n7. **Be prepared to abort** \u2013 If the wheels start to slip or you feel the vehicle becoming unstable, ease off the throttle, straighten the steering, and back out if necessary.  \n\n**Bottom line:** Only cross an incline when you\u2019re certain the terrain is stable, you have the right gear, and you can approach it at a shallow angle with low, controlled speed. If any doubt remains, find an alternate route that goes up or down the slope instead.",

WARNING: Driving across an incline increases the risk of a rollover, which may result in severe injury.\n\n Driving Across An Incline If at all possible, avoid driving across an incline.

Make sure the surface has good traction with firm and stable soils.  If possible, transverse the incline at an angle heading slightly up or down.  WARNING: Driving across an incline increases the risk of a rollover, which may result in severe injury.  Driving Downhill Before driving down a steep hill, you need to determine if it is too steep for a safe descent.  What is the surface traction?  Is the grade too steep to maintain a slow, controlled descent?  Are there obstacles?  Is it a straight descent?  Is there plenty of distance at the base of the hill to regain control if the vehicle descends too fast?  If you feel confident in your ability to proceed, then make sure you are in 4L and proceed with caution.  Allow engine braking to control the descent and apply your brakes, if necessary, but do not allow the tires to lock.  WARNING: Do not descend a steep grade in NEUTRAL.  Use vehicle brakes in conjunction with engine braking.  Descending a grade too fast could cause you to lose control and be seriously injured or killed.  Off-Road Driving Tips\n\n Driving Up Hill Once you have determined your ability to proceed and have shifted into the appropriate gear, line your vehicle up for the straightest possible run.  Accelerate with an easy constant throttle and apply more power as you start up the hill.  Do not race forward into a steep grade; the abrupt change of grade could cause you to lose control.  If the front end begins to bounce, ease off the throttle slightly to bring all four tires back on the ground.  As you approach the crest of the hill, ease off the throttle and slowly proceed over the top.  If the wheels start to slip as you approach the crest of a hill, ease off the accelerator and maintain headway by turning the steering wheel no more than a quarter turn quickly back and forth.  This will provide a fresh \"bite\" into the surface and will usually provide enough traction to complete the climb.  If you do not make it to the top, place the vehicle in REVERSE and back straight down the grade using engine resistance along with the vehicle brakes.  WARNING: Never attempt to climb a hill at an angle or turn around on a steep grade.  Driving across an incline increases the risk of a rollover, which may result in severe injury."

      "retrieved_chunks": [
        " For the recommended viscosity and quality grades seeThe Treadwear grade is a comparative rating, based on the wear rate of the tire when tested under controlled conditions on a specified government test course.  For example, a tire graded 150 would wear one and one-half times as well on the government course as a tire graded 100.  The relative performance of tires depends upon the actual conditions of their use, however, and may depart significantly from the norm due to variations in driving habits, service practices, and differences in road characteristics and climate.  The following tire grading categories were established by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.  The specific grade rating assigned by the tire's manufacturer in each category is shown on the sidewall of the tires on your vehicle.  The Traction grades, from highest to lowest, are AA, A, B, and C. These grades represent the tire's ability to stop on wet pavement, as measured under controlled conditions on specified government test surfaces of asphalt and concrete.  A tire marked C may have poor traction performance.  Sustained high temperature can cause the material of the tire to degenerate and reduce tire life, and excessive temperature can lead to sudden tire failure.  The grade C corresponds to a level of performance, which all passenger vehicle tires must meet under the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 109. Grades B and A represent higher levels of performance on the laboratory test wheel, than the minimum required by law.  The Temperature grades are A (the highest), B, and C, representing the tire's resistance to the generation of heat and its ability to dissipate heat, when tested under controlled conditions on a specified indoor laboratory test wheel.  The traction grade assigned to this tire is based on straight-ahead braking traction tests, and does not include acceleration, cornering, hydroplaning, or peak traction characteristics.  All passenger vehicle tires must conform to Federal safety requirements in addition to these grades.  For devices which are not made a favorite, the device priority is determined by the order in which it was paired.  The most recent device paired will have the higher priority.\n\n Temperature Grades The Temperature grades are A (the highest), B, and C, representing the tire's resistance to the generation of heat and its ability to dissipate heat, when tested under controlled conditions on a specified indoor laboratory test wheel.

The grade C corresponds to a level of performance, which all passenger vehicle tires must meet under the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 109. Grades B and A represent higher levels of performance on the laboratory test wheel, than the minimum required by law.  WARNING: The temperature grade for this tire is established for a tire that is properly inflated and not overloaded.  Excessive speed, under-inflation, or excessive loading, either separately or in combination, can cause heat build-up and possible tire failure.\n\n Traction Grades The Traction grades, from highest to lowest, are AA, A, B, and C.These grades represent the tire's ability to stop on wet pavement, as measured under controlled conditions on specified government test surfaces of asphalt and concrete.

If using a manual transmission vehicle for trailer towing, all starts must be in first gear to avoid excessive clutch slippage.  TRAILER TOWING In this section you will find safety tips and information on limits to the type of towing you can reasonably do with your vehicle.  Before towing a trailer, carefully review this information to tow your load as efficiently and safely as possible.  To maintain the New Vehicle Limited Warranty coverage, follow the requirements and recommendations in this manual concerning vehicles used for trailer towing.  TOWING A DISABLED VEHICLE This section describes procedures for towing a disabled vehicle using a commercial towing service.  If the transmission and drivetrain are operable, disabled vehicles may also be towed as described on Proper towing or lifting equipment is required to prevent damage to your vehicle.  Use only tow bars and other equipment designed for this purpose, following equipment manufacturer\u2019s instructions.  Use of safety chains is mandatory.  Attach a tow bar or other towing device to main structural members of the vehicle, not to fascia/bumpers or associated brackets.  State and local laws regarding vehicles under tow must be observed.  If you must use the accessories (wipers, defrosters, etc.)  while being towed, the ignition must be in the ON/RUN position, not the ACC position.  If the vehicle's battery is discharged, instructions on shifting the automatic transmission out of PARK (P) in order to move the vehicle CAUTION: Do not use sling type equipment when towing.  Vehicle damage may occur.  When securing the vehicle to a flatbed truck, do not attach to front or rear suspension components.  Damage to your vehicle may result from improper towing.\n\n Towing Requirements To promote proper break-in of your new vehicle drivetrain components, the following guidelines are recommended: WARNING: Improper towing can lead to a collision.  Follow these guidelines to make your trailer towing as safe as possible: Make certain that the load is secured in the trailer and that it will not shift during travel.  When trailering cargo that is not fully secured, dynamic load shifts can occur that may be difficult for the driver to control.  You could lose control of your vehicle and have a collision.  When hauling cargo, or towing a trailer, do not overload your vehicle or trailer.  Overloading can cause a loss of control, poor performance, or damage to brakes, axle, engine, transmission, steering, suspension, chassis structure, or tires.  Safety chains must always be used between your vehicle and trailer.  Always connect the chains to the frame or hook retainers of the vehicle hitch.  Cross the chains under the trailer tongue and allow enough slack for turning corners.  Vehicles with trailers should not be parked on a grade.  When parking, apply the parking brake on the tow vehicle.  Put the tow vehicle transmission in PARK.  Always block or \"chock\" the trailer wheels.  GCWR must not be exceeded.  Total weight must be distributed between the tow vehicle and the trailer such that the following four ratings are not exceeded: gvwr gtw gawr tongue weight rating for the trailer hitch utilized caution: do not tow a trailer at all during the first 500 miles (805 km) the new vehicle is driven.  The engine, axle or other parts could be damaged.  Then, during the first 500 miles (805 km) that a trailer is towed, do not drive over 50 mph (80 km/h) and do not make starts at full throttle.  This helps the engine and other parts of the vehicle wear in at the heavier loads."

        " The Bed Rail Tie Down system allows you to properly secure cargo in the truck bed.  Bed Rail Tie Down Locations Your vehicle is equipped with the child restraint anchorage system called LATCH, which stands for Lower Anchors and Tethers for CHildren.  The LATCH system has three vehicle anchor points for installing LATCH-equipped child seats.  There are two lower anchorages located at the back of the seat cushion where it meets the seatback and one top tether anchorage located behind the seating position.  These anchorages are used to install LATCH-equipped child seats without using the vehicle\u2019s seat belts.  Some seating positions may have a top tether anchorage but no lower anchorages.  In these seating positions, the seat belt must be used with the top tether anchorage to install the child restraint.  Please see the following table for more information.  The TSC is a telescoping link that can be installed between the hitch receiver and the trailer tongue.  It typically provides adjustable friction associated with the telescoping motion to dampen any unwanted trailer swaying motions while traveling.  Supplemental Seat-Mounted Side Air Bags (SABs) are located in the outboard side of the front seats.  The SABs are marked with a \u201cSRS AIRBAG\u201d or \u201cAIRBAG\u201d on a label or on the seat trim on the outboard side of the seats.  Four auxiliary switches are located in the lower switch bank of the instrument panel and can be used to power various electrical devices.  1 \u2014 Retainers 2 \u2014 Fuel Filter Protective Cover The fold-down windshield on your vehicle is a structural element that can provide protection in some accidents.  The windshield also provides protection against weather, road debris and intrusion of small branches and other objects.\n\n Weight-Distributing Hitch A Weight-Distributing Hitch system works by applying leverage through spring (load) bars.  They are typically used for heavier loads to distribute trailer tongue weight to the tow vehicle's front axle and the trailer axle(s).  When used in accordance with the manufacturer's directions, it provides for a more level ride, offering more consistent steering and brake control thereby enhancing towing safety.  The addition of a friction/hydraulic sway control also dampens sway caused by traffic and crosswinds and contributes positively to tow vehicle and trailer stability.  Trailer sway control and a Weight-Distributing (load equalizing) Hitch are recommended for heavier Tongue Weights (TW) and may be required depending on vehicle and trailer configuration/loading to comply with Gross Axle Weight Rating (GAWR) requirements.  WARNING: An improperly adjusted Weight-Distributing Hitch system may reduce handling, stability, braking performance, and could result in a collision.  Weight-Distributing Hitch systems may not be compatible with surge brake couplers.  Consult with your hitch and trailer manufacturer or a reputable Recreational Vehicle dealer for additional information.\n\n BED RAIL TIE DOWN SYSTEM \u2014 IF EQUIPPED The Bed Rail Tie Down system allows you to properly secure cargo in the truck bed.  There are two adjustable utility rail cleats on each side of the bed that can be used to assist in securing cargo.  Each utility rail cleat must be tightened down in one of the detents along either utility rail in order to keep cargo properly secured.  To move the utility rail cleat to any position on the utility rail, turn the cleat retainer nut counterclockwise several times.  Then, pull out on the utility rail cleat and slide it to the detent nearest the desired location.  Make sure the utility rail cleat is seated in the detent, and tighten the nut.  To remove the utility rail cleats from the side utility rails, slide the cleat to the rectangular cutout located at the end of the rail toward the front of the vehicle.  To remove the utility rail cleat from the front utility rail, slide the cleat to the rectangular cutout located on the left side of the rail.  CAUTION: The maximum load per cleat should not exceed 250 lb (113 kg) and the angle of the load on each cleat should not exceed 45 degrees above horizontal, or damage to the cleat or cleat rail may occur.

        " Under certain conditions, the mobile phone being on in your vehicle can cause erratic or noisy performance from your radio.  This condition may be lessened or eliminated by repositioning the mobile phone within the vehicle.  This condition is not harmful to the radio.  If your radio performance does not satisfactorily improve from repositioning the mobile phone, it is recommended that the volume be turned down or off during mobile phone operation when not using the Uconnect system.  Jamming due to electronic devices or driving next to facilities emitting the same radio frequencies as the TPMS sensors.  Installing some form of aftermarket window tinting that affects radio wave signals.  Lots of snow or ice around the wheels or wheel housings.  Using tire chains on the vehicle.  Using wheels/tires not equipped with TPMS sensors.  The radio unit is acting as the amplifier for audio output from the Auxiliary device.  Therefore, if the volume control on the Auxiliary device is set too low, there will be insufficient audio signal for the radio unit to play the music on the device.\n\n Once a month or before a long trip: check engine oil level check windshield washer fluid level check the tire pressures and look for unusual wear or damage check the fluid levels of the coolant reservoir, brake master cylinder, and fill as needed check function of all interior and exterior lights once a month or before a long trip: check engine oil level.  Check windshield washer fluid level Check the tire pressures and look for unusual wear or damage, rotate at the first sign of irregular wear.  Check the fluid levels of the coolant reservoir, brake master cylinder, and power steering, and fill as needed.  Check function of all interior and exterior lights What to do when an electrical load reduction action message is present (\u201cbattery saver on\u201d or \u201cbattery saver mode\u201d) during a trip: reduce power to unnecessary loads if possible: turn off redundant lights (interior or exterior) check what may be plugged in to power outlets +12 volt, 115 volts ac, usb ports check hvac settings (blower, temperature) check the audio settings (volume) after a trip: check if any aftermarket equipment was installed (additional lights, upfitter electrical accessories, audio systems, alarms) and review specifications if any (load and ignition off draw currents).  Evaluate the latest driving cycles (distance, driving time and parking time).  The vehicle should have service performed if the message is still present during consecutive trips and the evaluation of the vehicle and driving pattern did not help to identify the cause.\n\n After Driving Off-Road Off-road operation puts more stress on your vehicle than does most on-road driving.  After going off-road, it is always a good idea to check for damage.  That way you can get any problems taken care of right away and have your vehicle ready when you need it.  Completely inspect the underbody of your vehicle.  Check tires, body structure, steering, suspension, driveline, and exhaust system for damage.  Inspect the radiator for mud and debris and clean as required.  Check threaded fasteners for looseness, particularly on the chassis, drivetrain components, steering, and suspension.  Retighten them, if required, and torque to the values specified in the Service Manual.  Check for accumulations of plants or brush.  These things could be a fire hazard.  They might hide damage to fuel lines, brake hoses, axle pinion seals, and propeller shafts.  After extended operation in mud, sand, water, or similar dirty conditions, have the radiator, fan, brake rotors, wheels, brake linings, and axle yokes inspected and cleaned as soon as possible.  Note: inspect the clutch vent holes in the manual transmission bell housing for mud and debris and clean as required.  Warning: abrasive material in any part of the brakes may cause excessive wear or unpredictable braking.  You might not have full braking power when you need it to prevent a collision.  If you have been operating your vehicle in dirty conditions, get your brakes checked and cleaned as necessary.  If you experience unusual vibration after driving in mud, slush or similar conditions, check the wheels for impacted material.  Impacted material can cause a wheel imbalance and freeing the wheels of it will correct the situation."

If the bulb does not come on when turning the ignition switch from OFF to ON/RUN, have the condition checked promptly.  Cycle the ignition switch to the ON position, but do not crank or start the engine.  If you crank or start the engine, you will have to start this test over.  As soon as you cycle the ignition switch to the ON position, you will see the Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) symbol come on as part of a normal bulb check.  Approximately 15 seconds later, one of two things will happen: The MIL will flash for about 10 seconds and then return to being fully illuminated until you turn OFF the ignition or start the engine.  This means that your vehicle's obd ii system is not ready and you should not proceed to the i/m station.  The MIL will not flash at all and will remain fully illuminated until you place the ignition in the off position or start the engine.  This means that your vehicle's obd ii system is ready and you can proceed to the i/m station.  Your vehicle has a simple ignition actuated test, which you can use prior to going to the test station.  To check if your vehicle's OBD II system is ready, you must do the following:\n\n Air Bag Warning Light The Air Bag Warning Light will turn on for four to eight seconds as a bulb check when the ignition switch is first placed in the ON/RUN position.

You have full responsibility and assume all risks related to the use of the features and applications in this vehicle.  Only use the features and applications when it is safe to do so.  Failure to do so may result in an accident involving serious injury or death.  Note: your vehicle may be transmitting data as authorized by the subscriber.  Once a connection is made between the vehicle\u2019s SOS Call system and the SOS operator, the SOS operator may be able to open a voice connection with the vehicle to determine if additional help is needed.  Once the SOS operator opens a voice connection with the vehicle\u2019s SOS Call system, the operator should be able to speak with the vehicle occupants, and hear sounds occurring in the vehicle.  The vehicle\u2019s SOS Call system will attempt to remain connected with the SOS operator until the SOS operator terminates the connection.  The SOS operator may attempt to contact appropriate emergency responders and provide them with important vehicle information and GPS coordinates.  WARNING: If anyone in the vehicle could be in danger (e.g., fire or smoke is visible, dangerous road conditions or location), do not wait for voice contact from an Emergency Services Agent.  All occupants should exit the vehicle immediately and move to a safe location.  Never place anything on or near the vehicle\u2019s operable network and GPS antennas.  You could prevent operable network and GPS signal reception, which can prevent your vehicle from placing an emergency call.  An operable network and GPS signal reception is required for the SOS Call system to function properly.  The SOS Call system is embedded into the vehicle\u2019s electrical system.  Do not add aftermarket electrical equipment to the vehicle\u2019s electrical system.  This may prevent your vehicle from sending a signal to initiate an emergency call.  To avoid interference that can cause the SOS Call system to fail, never add aftermarket equipment (e.g., two-way mobile radio, CB radio, data recorder, etc.)  to your vehicle\u2019s electrical system or modify the antennas on your vehicle.  IF YOUR VEHICLE LOSES BATTERY POWER FOR ANY REASON (INCLUDING DURING OR AFTER AN ACCIDENT), THE UCONNECT FEATURES, APPS AND SERVICES, AMONG OTHERS, WILL NOT OPERATE.  Modifications to any part of the SOS Call system could cause the air bag system to fail when you need it.  You could be injured if the air bag system is not there to help protect you.\n\n ASSIST AND SOS SYSTEM \u2014 IF EQUIPPED If equipped, the overhead console contains an ASSIST and an SOS button.  WARNING: ALWAYS obey traffic laws and pay attention to the road.  ALWAYS drive safely with your hands on the steering wheel.  You have full responsibility and assume all risks related to the use of the features and applications in this vehicle.  Only use the features and applications when it is safe to do so.  Failure to do so may result in an accident involving serious injury or death.  Note: Your vehicle may be transmitting data as authorized by the subscriber The ASSIST and SOS buttons will only function if you are connected to an operable LTE (voice/data) or 4G (data) network, which comes as a built-in function.  These and other connected services will only be operable if your SiriusXM Guardian\u2122 service is active and you are connected to an operable LTE (voice/data) or 4G (data) network.  Off Road+ Display \u2014 If Equipped When the Off Road+ button is pushed in the switch bank, the Instrument Cluster Display will begin to show messages related to the feature.  Depending on the Four-Wheel Drive mode in use, the messages will differ, and after five seconds, all messages will clear from the display.  The messages are as follows: 2h: off road+ unavailable, shift to 4wd 4h: 4wd high off road+ active 4l: 4wd low off road+ active adaptive cruise control (acc) and cruise control are not available when using off road+.  If either option is selected, a dedicated message will display indicating that the features are not usable concurrently.  Messages are as follows: 4h: cruise control \u2014 cruise control unavailable in off road+ 4h: adaptive cruise control \u2014 adaptive cruise control (acc) unavailable in off road+ 4l: cruise control \u2014 cruise control unavailable in 4wd low 4l: adaptive cruise control \u2014 adaptive cruise control (acc) unavailable in 4wd low note: the behavior of electronic stability control while in off road+ varies depending on the 4wd status.  If the vehicle is in 4WD High, Traction Control is automatically turned off.  Also, holding the ESC OFF button for five seconds will turn off ESC.  In 4WD Low, Electronic Stability Control automatically shuts off regardless of the Off Road Status.  If equipped, vehicles with an ASSIST and an SOS button are connected vehicles.  These buttons will be located on either the rearview mirror or overhead console, depending on the vehicle.  If these buttons are present in your vehicle, you have a connected radio and can take advantage of the many connected vehicle features.  For further information about the ASSIST and SOS buttons"

If using a manual transmission vehicle for trailer towing, all starts must be in first gear to avoid excessive clutch slippage.  TRAILER TOWING In this section you will find safety tips and information on limits to the type of towing you can reasonably do with your vehicle.  Before towing a trailer, carefully review this information to tow your load as efficiently and safely as possible.  To maintain the New Vehicle Limited Warranty coverage, follow the requirements and recommendations in this manual concerning vehicles used for trailer towing.  TOWING A DISABLED VEHICLE This section describes procedures for towing a disabled vehicle using a commercial towing service.  If the transmission and drivetrain are operable, disabled vehicles may also be towed as described on Proper towing or lifting equipment is required to prevent damage to your vehicle.  Use only tow bars and other equipment designed for this purpose, following equipment manufacturer\u2019s instructions.  Use of safety chains is mandatory.  Attach a tow bar or other towing device to main structural members of the vehicle, not to fascia/bumpers or associated brackets.  State and local laws regarding vehicles under tow must be observed.  If you must use the accessories (wipers, defrosters, etc.)  while being towed, the ignition must be in the ON/RUN position, not the ACC position.  If the vehicle's battery is discharged, instructions on shifting the automatic transmission out of PARK (P) in order to move the vehicle CAUTION: Do not use sling type equipment when towing.  Vehicle damage may occur.  When securing the vehicle to a flatbed truck, do not attach to front or rear suspension components.  Damage to your vehicle may result from improper towing.\n\n Towing Requirements To promote proper break-in of your new vehicle drivetrain components, the following guidelines are recommended: WARNING: Improper towing can lead to a collision.  Follow these guidelines to make your trailer towing as safe as possible: Make certain that the load is secured in the trailer and that it will not shift during travel.  When trailering cargo that is not fully secured, dynamic load shifts can occur that may be difficult for the driver to control.  You could lose control of your vehicle and have a collision.  When hauling cargo, or towing a trailer, do not overload your vehicle or trailer.  Overloading can cause a loss of control, poor performance, or damage to brakes, axle, engine, transmission, steering, suspension, chassis structure, or tires.  Safety chains must always be used between your vehicle and trailer.  Always connect the chains to the frame or hook retainers of the vehicle hitch.  Cross the chains under the trailer tongue and allow enough slack for turning corners.  Vehicles with trailers should not be parked on a grade.  When parking, apply the parking brake on the tow vehicle.  Put the tow vehicle transmission in PARK.  Always block or \"chock\" the trailer wheels.  GCWR must not be exceeded.  Total weight must be distributed between the tow vehicle and the trailer such that the following four ratings are not exceeded: gvwr gtw gawr tongue weight rating for the trailer hitch utilized caution: do not tow a trailer at all during the first 500 miles (805 km) the new vehicle is driven.  The engine, axle or other parts could be damaged.  Then, during the first 500 miles (805 km) that a trailer is towed, do not drive over 50 mph (80 km/h) and do not make starts at full throttle.  This helps the engine and other parts of the vehicle wear in at the heavier loads."

WARNING: Do not drive the vehicle with the rear window up/removed unless the quarter windows are also removed.  Dangerous exhaust gases could enter the vehicle causing harm to the driver and passengers.  The fabric quarter windows and fabric top are designed only for protection against the elements.  Do not rely on them to contain occupants within the vehicle or to protect against injury during an accident.  Remember, always wear seat belts.  Make sure hands and fingers are clear of all pinch points when installing and removing the soft top.  The lift assist mechanism and side bows may cause serious injury if fingers or hands get caught in between.  CAUTION: The soft top is not designed to carry any additional loads such as roof racks, spare tires, building, hunting or camping supplies, and/or luggage, etc.  Also, it was not designed as a structural member of the vehicle and, thus, cannot properly carry any additional loads other than environmental (rain, snow, etc.).  CAUTION: Do not run a fabric top through an automatic car wash.  Window scratches and wax buildup may result.  Do not lower the top when the temperature is below 41\u00b0F (5\u00b0C).  Damage to the top may result.  Do not move your vehicle until the top has been either fully attached to the windshield frame, or fully lowered.  Follow the proper steps for cleaning and caring for your vehicle\u2019s fabric top Do not use any tools (screwdrivers, etc.)  to pry or force any of the clamps, clips, or retainers securing the soft top.  Do not force or pry the soft top framework when opening or closing.  Damage to the top may result.  Failure to follow these cautions may cause interior water damage, stains, or mildew on the top material: It is recommended that the top be free of water prior to opening it.  Operating the top, opening a door or lowering a window while the top is wet may allow water to drip into the vehicle's interior.  Careless handling and storage of the soft top may damage the seals, causing water to leak into the vehicle's interior.  The soft top must be positioned properly to ensure sealing.  Improper installation can cause water to leak into the vehicle's interior."
