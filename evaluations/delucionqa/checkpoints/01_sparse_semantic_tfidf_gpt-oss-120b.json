Maintain the outside air intake: Ensure the air intake located in front of the windshield is free of obstructions, such as leaves. Blocked air intake can reduce airflow and potentially lead to issues like water drains getting plugged.\n\n2. Avoid excessive recirculation: Refrain from using the recirculation mode for extended periods without the air conditioning (A/C) on. Prolonged use of recirculation mode can lead to fogging and poor air quality inside the vehicle.\n\n3. Use the climate control system effectively: Utilize the Defrost or Mix mode and increase the front blower speed to clear any fogging on the windows. This helps maintain good visibility and air circulation.\n\n4. Manage the A/C system: If the A/C performance seems lower than expected, check the front of the A/C condenser (located in front of the radiator) for any dirt or insect accumulation. Clean the condenser with a gentle water spray to improve the A/C's effectiveness.\n\n5. Avoid excessive engine heat buildup: If the engine is experiencing severe and abnormal overheating, stop the vehicle, turn off the engine, and allow it to cool. Seek immediate service and a tune-up to manufacturer's specifications to address the issue, as this can help maintain proper air quality and prevent any potential odors.\n\nBy following these tips, you can help keep the air inside the vehicle fresh and improve the overall cabin environment.",

Breach of vehicle systems: The passage states that it is not possible to know or predict all the possible outcomes if the vehicle's systems are breached. This could impair the safety-related systems or result in a loss of vehicle control, leading to an accident.\n\n2. Inappropriate use of Cruise Control: The passage warns against using Cruise Control in heavy traffic, on winding, icy, snow-covered, or slippery roads, as the system may not be able to maintain a constant speed, causing the vehicle to go too fast for the conditions and leading to a loss of control.\n\n3. Rollover risk: The passage highlights that utility vehicles have a significantly higher rollover rate than other types of vehicles due to their higher ground clearance and center of gravity. It warns that if the vehicle goes out of control, it may roll over, which can result in severe or fatal injury.\n\n4. Failure to wear seat belts: The passage emphasizes that failure to use the driver and passenger seat belts provided is a major cause of severe or fatal injury, and in a rollover crash, an unbelted person is significantly more likely to die than a person wearing a seat belt.\n\nIn summary, the key factors that can cause a car to go out of control, as mentioned in the context, are breach of vehicle systems, inappropriate use of Cruise Control, the inherent rollover risk of certain vehicle types, and failure to wear seat belts.",

      "question": "what does the engine oil change indicator system do?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the context provided, the engine oil change indicator system in the vehicle has the following key functions:\n\n1. It monitors the engine operation conditions and determines when the next scheduled oil change is required.\n\n2. When it's time for an oil change, it will display the \"Oil Change Required\" message in the instrument cluster display for 5 seconds, accompanied by a single chime. This alerts the driver that an oil change is needed.\n\n3. The oil change interval is duty cycle-based, meaning it can fluctuate depending on the driver's personal driving style and operating conditions like frequent short trips, towing, or extreme temperatures.\n\n4. Unless the oil change indicator system is reset after the scheduled maintenance is performed, the \"Oil Change Required\" message will continue to display each time the ignition is turned on.\n\n5. To temporarily turn off the message, the driver can push and release the \"OK\" button.\n\n6. To fully reset the oil change indicator system after the scheduled oil change, the driver needs to follow a specific reset procedure.\n\nSo in summary, the engine oil change indicator system automatically monitors the oil life and notifies the driver when it's time for an oil change, based on the actual vehicle operating conditions.",

To prevent wheel lock-up during braking, especially on slippery or unstable road conditions such as ice, snow, gravel, bumps, etc.\n\n2. To enhance vehicle stability and control during braking by automatically preventing the wheels from locking up.\n\n3. To provide increased brake performance and shorter stopping distances under most braking conditions compared to a non-ABS system.\n\nThe key points about the ABS function are:\n\n- It automatically senses when one or more wheels are beginning to lock up and adjusts the brake pressure to prevent the wheels from locking.\n- This helps maintain steering control and prevents the wheels from losing traction, which could lead to skidding or loss of control.\n- The ABS enhances vehicle stability and control during braking maneuvers.\n- It is designed to work with the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) tires and modifications may degrade its performance.\n\nIn summary, the primary function of the ABS is to improve vehicle stability and braking performance, especially on slippery or unstable road surfaces, by preventing wheel lock-up during braking.",

      "ground_truth_answer": "To use the windshield washer wiper control lever, pull the lever toward you and hold it until the desired spray is reached. If the lever is pulled while in the delay range, the wipers will continue to operate for two or three wipe cycles after the lever is released. If the lever is pulled while in the off position, the wipers will operate for two or three wipe cycles and then turn off. Remember that the washer function will stop if the switch is held for more than 20 seconds, and to avoid sudden icing of the windshield during freezing weather, warm the windshield with the defroster before and during windshield washer use.",
      "generated_response": "Here are the practical tips for using the windshield\u2011washer/wiper control lever:\n\n1. **Locate the lever** \u2013 It\u2019s on the right side of the steering column. The end of the lever has a small rotary switch that selects the different wiper speeds and intervals.\n\n2. **Activate the washer** \u2013 Pull the lever **toward you** and keep it held down. The washer pump will run and spray fluid onto the glass. Release the lever when you have enough spray.\n\n3. **Don\u2019t rely on the \u201cmist\u201d setting** \u2013 The mist function only moves the wipers; it does **not** activate the washer pump, so no fluid will be sprayed. Use the dedicated washer pull\u2011toward\u2011you action instead.\n\n4. **Warm the glass first in cold weather** \u2013 Before you spray washer fluid in freezing conditions, turn on the defroster (or heater) to warm the windshield. This prevents the fluid from freezing instantly and causing a sudden ice layer.\n\n5. **Know the delay\u2011range behavior** \u2013 If you pull the lever while the wipers are in a delayed\u2011interval mode, the wipers will start immediately and will continue for two or three extra wipe cycles after you let go of the lever.

You should not proceed to the I/M station.\n   - If the MIL does not flash and stays fully illuminated, your OBD II system is ready, and you can proceed to the I/M station.\n\n2. If your OBD II system is not ready:\n   - Drive your vehicle as you normally would to allow the OBD II system to update.\n   - Recheck the readiness with the ignition test procedure.\n   - If the system is still not ready, you should see an authorized dealer or repair facility.\n\n3. Regardless of the OBD II system readiness:\n   - If the MIL is illuminated during normal vehicle operation, have your vehicle serviced before going to the I/M station. The I/M station can fail your vehicle if the MIL is on with the engine running.\n\n4. Ensure your vehicle's exhaust system is in good condition:\n   - Have the exhaust system inspected every time the vehicle is raised.\n   - Have any abnormal conditions repaired promptly.\n   - Until repaired, drive with all side windows fully open to avoid carbon monoxide exposure.\n\nBy following these steps, you can ensure your vehicle is prepared for the emission inspection and avoid potential issues or failures.",

Here\u2019s a quick checklist to get you there:\n\n1. **Confirm the MIL is off**  \n   - Start the engine and look at the dashboard. The MIL (often a yellow \u201ccheck engine\u201d lamp) should come on briefly, then go out. If it stays lit, have the code read and cleared before the inspection.\n\n2. **Make sure the OBD\u2011II system is \u201cready\u201d**  \n   - Use a scan tool or a code reader that can display the \u201creadiness monitors.\u201d All of the required monitors (e.g., catalyst, evaporative system, oxygen sensors, etc.) should show **Ready**.  \n   - If any monitor shows **Not Ready**, the car will likely fail the I/M test.\n\n3. **Give the OBD\u2011II system time to set**  \n   - The system may be \u201cnot ready\u201d after recent work, a battery discharge, or a battery replacement.

      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the context provided, here are some tips if you have to drive across an incline:\n\n1. Avoid driving across an incline if at all possible. Only do it if absolutely necessary.\n\n2. Know your vehicle's abilities and limitations when it comes to driving across an incline.\n\n3. Driving across an incline places more weight on the downhill wheels, increasing the risk of a downhill slide or rollover.\n\n4. Make sure the surface has good traction with firm and stable soils.\n\n5. If possible, try to transverse the incline at an angle, heading slightly up or down the incline rather than directly across.\n\n6. WARNING: Driving across an incline increases the risk of a rollover, which may result in severe injury. Exercise extreme caution if you have to do this.\n\nThe key advice is to avoid driving across an incline unless absolutely necessary, and if you must do it, be very careful and aware of the increased risks involved.",
      "generated_response": "If you can\u2019t avoid crossing an incline, follow these safety\u2011first steps:\n\n1. **Pick the best line** \u2013 Aim for the straightest, most level part of the slope.  \n2. **Approach at an angle** \u2013 Whenever possible, cross the incline at a slight angle so you\u2019re heading a little up\u2011hill or down\u2011hill rather than perfectly across. This reduces the lateral forces that can cause a rollover.  \n3. **Use the right gear** \u2013 Shift into a low\u2011range gear before you reach the slope so you have enough torque and control.  \n4. **Maintain a steady throttle** \u2013 Apply a smooth, constant amount of power. As the front wheels start to climb, add a little more throttle to keep momentum without jerking.  \n5. **Keep the vehicle level** \u2013 Keep the wheels as straight as possible and avoid sudden steering inputs.  \n6. **Watch your speed** \u2013 Don\u2019t rush the crossing; a moderate speed gives you better control and reduces the chance of a tip\u2011over.  \n7. **Be aware of rollover risk** \u2013 Crossing an incline is one of the higher\u2011risk maneuvers for rollovers, so stay alert, keep your center of gravity low, and be prepared to abort if the terrain looks unstable.\n\nBy following these guidelines\u2014choosing an angled path, using the correct gear, and applying smooth, consistent power\u2014you\u2019ll minimize the rollover danger when you have to drive across an incline.",

Properly distribute the weight between the tow vehicle and trailer to stay within the limits for Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR), Gross Trailer Weight (GTW), and Tongue Weight Rating for the trailer hitch.\n\n5. Always use safety chains, connecting them to the frame or hook retainers of the vehicle hitch, and crossing them under the trailer tongue.\n\n6. Do not tow a trailer at all during the first 500 miles the new vehicle is driven, and for the first 500 miles of trailer towing, do not drive over 50 mph and avoid full throttle starts.\n\n7. Observe state and local laws regarding vehicles under tow, and use only proper towing/lifting equipment designed for this purpose.\n\n8.

      "question": "Can I keep the top folded down for a long time?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the information provided, it is not recommended to keep the top folded down for a long period of time. The key points are:\n\n1. If the temperature is below 72\u00b0F (24\u00b0C) and/or the top has been folded down for a period of time, the top will appear to have shrunk when you raise it, making it difficult to put up. This is caused by a natural contraction of the vinyl or acrylic materials of the fabric top.\n\n2. It is recommended to place the vehicle in a warm area and pull steadily on the top fabric to allow the vinyl to stretch back to its original size before installing the top.\n\n3. The passage states \"Do not lower the top when the temperature is below 41\u00b0F (5\u00b0C). Damage to the top may result.\"\n\nSo in summary, leaving the top folded down for a long time, especially in cold temperatures, can cause the material to contract and make it difficult to raise the top back up again. It is recommended to only fold down the top when necessary and to raise it as soon as possible to avoid potential damage to the material.",

Specifically, the passage states:\n\n\"The voltmeter may show a gauge fluctuation at various engine temperatures. This is caused by the glow plug heating system. The number of cycles and the length of the cycling operation is controlled by the engine control module. Glow plug heater operation can run for several minutes. Once the heater operation is complete the voltmeter needle will stabilize.\"\n\nThe glow plug heating system is controlled by the engine control module and causes the engine temperature and voltmeter reading to fluctuate temporarily during its operation, which can last for several minutes. This is normal behavior and not an indication of a problem with the engine or cooling system.",
      "generated_response": "The gauge is simply reporting the temperature of the engine\u2019s coolant, and it\u2019s normal for that temperature to move up and down a bit as the engine\u2019s operating conditions change.  \n\nTypical reasons a coolant\u2011temperature reading will fluctuate (even while staying within the \u201cnormal\u201d range) include:\n\n* **Changing engine load** \u2013 accelerating, climbing a hill, towing, or idling all cause the engine to produce different amounts of heat, so the coolant temperature will rise or fall accordingly.  \n* **Thermostat cycling** \u2013 the thermostat opens and closes to keep the coolant within a set temperature band. When it opens, cooler coolant from the radiator mixes in and the gauge may dip; when it closes, the temperature climbs again.  \n* **Coolant flow variations** \u2013 the water pump, radiator fan, and even ambient air temperature affect how quickly heat is removed, producing small, short\u2011term swings.  \n* **Ambient temperature** \u2013 colder outside air lets the cooling system shed heat faster, while hot weather reduces heat\u2011rejection, both causing the gauge to move.  \n\nAs long as the needle stays inside the manufacturer\u2011specified normal range, those fluctuations are expected and indicate the cooling system is functioning properly. If the gauge repeatedly spikes outside that range (e.g., into the red), then further inspection would be needed.",

      "question": "What should I pay attention to for the clutch pedal?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the provided context, here are the key things to pay attention to regarding the clutch pedal:\n\n1. Fully press the clutch pedal before shifting gears. Pressing the clutch pedal all the way down is necessary when changing gears to prevent damage to the transmission.\n\n2. As you release the clutch pedal, lightly press the accelerator pedal. This coordination of the clutch and accelerator is important for smooth gear shifts.\n\n3. Certain noise from the transmission may be noticeable when the clutch is engaged (pedal released). This noise is normal and not an indication of a problem with the clutch or transmission.\n\n4. Ensure the carpet is securely attached and does not interfere with the operation of the clutch pedal. Unattached or improperly placed carpet could get stuck under the clutch pedal and cause a loss of vehicle control.\n\nIn summary, focus on fully pressing and properly releasing the clutch pedal during gear shifts, be aware of normal transmission noises, and ensure the floor carpet does not impact clutch pedal operation.",
      "generated_response": "When it comes to the clutch pedal, keep the following points in mind:\n\n1. **Full Depression Before Shifting**  \n   - Always press the clutch pedal all the way down before you move the gear lever. This ensures the transmission is fully disengaged and prevents gear\u2011grinding.\n\n2. **Smooth Release With Light Throttle**  \n   - As you let the clutch pedal up, gently press the accelerator. A smooth, coordinated release helps the engine take over power without jerking.\n\n3. **Check for Pedal Interference**  \n   - Fully depress the clutch (and the brake and accelerator) to make sure nothing\u2014such as floor mats, carpet, or loose objects\u2014hits or blocks the pedal travel. Re\u2011install any floor mats only after confirming clear movement.\n\n4. **Secure Carpet / Floor Mats**  \n   - Use carpet that is designed for your vehicle and fasten it with the supplied grommets so it can\u2019t shift and interfere with the clutch (or any other) pedal.\n\n5. **Keep the Driver\u2019s\u2011Side Floor Area Clear**  \n   - Objects that can fall or slide under the pedals may become trapped, causing loss of control. Before driving, verify that nothing is loose in the footwell.\n\n6. **Normal Transmission Noise**  \n   - Some noise from the transmission, especially when idling in neutral with the clutch engaged,",
