      "question": "What should I pay attention to for the clutch pedal?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the provided context, here are the key things to pay attention to regarding the clutch pedal:\n\n1. Fully press the clutch pedal before shifting gears. Pressing the clutch pedal all the way down is necessary when changing gears to prevent damage to the transmission.\n\n2. As you release the clutch pedal, lightly press the accelerator pedal. This coordination of the clutch and accelerator is important for smooth gear shifts.\n\n3. Certain noise from the transmission may be noticeable when the clutch is engaged (pedal released). This noise is normal and not an indication of a problem with the clutch or transmission.\n\n4. Ensure the carpet is securely attached and does not interfere with the operation of the clutch pedal. Unattached or improperly placed carpet could get stuck under the clutch pedal and cause a loss of vehicle control.\n\nIn summary, focus on fully pressing and properly releasing the clutch pedal during gear shifts, be aware of normal transmission noises, and ensure the floor carpet does not impact clutch pedal operation.",
      "generated_response": "When it comes to the clutch pedal, keep the following points in mind:\n\n1. **Fully depress it before you shift** \u2013 Press the clutch pedal all the way down every time you\u2019re about to change gears. This ensures the transmission is disengaged and prevents gear\u2011grinding.\n\n2. **Release it smoothly** \u2013 As you let the clutch pedal come back up, add a light amount of throttle. A gradual release helps the clutch engage smoothly and avoids jerky starts.\n\n3. **Check for pedal interference** \u2013 With the clutch pedal fully depressed, make sure it doesn\u2019t rub or interfere with the accelerator or brake pedals. If you notice any binding, adjust the pedal or reinstall the floor mats correctly.\n\n4. **Watch for abnormal movement** \u2013 The pedal should have a firm, consistent travel from top to bottom. Any sponginess, sticking, or excessive play could indicate a problem that needs attention.\n\n5. **Remember normal transmission noise** \u2013 Some noise while the clutch is engaged (pedal released) is typical, especially when the vehicle is idling in neutral or when the transmission is warm. This isn\u2019t a clutch issue unless accompanied by other symptoms (slipping, difficulty shifting, etc.).\n\nBy paying attention to these aspects\u2014full depression, smooth release, lack of interference, and normal pedal feel\u2014you\u2019ll keep the clutch operating correctly and avoid unnecessary wear.",

      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the given context, here are some tips to help keep the air inside the vehicle fresh:\n\n1. Maintain the outside air intake: Ensure the air intake located in front of the windshield is free of obstructions, such as leaves. Blocked air intake can reduce airflow and potentially lead to issues like water drains getting plugged.\n\n2. Avoid excessive recirculation: Refrain from using the recirculation mode for extended periods without the air conditioning (A/C) on. Prolonged use of recirculation mode can lead to fogging and poor air quality inside the vehicle.\n\n3. Use the climate control system effectively: Utilize the Defrost or Mix mode and increase the front blower speed to clear any fogging on the windows. This helps maintain good visibility and air circulation.\n\n4. Manage the A/C system: If the A/C performance seems lower than expected, check the front of the A/C condenser (located in front of the radiator) for any dirt or insect accumulation. Clean the condenser with a gentle water spray to improve the A/C's effectiveness.\n\n5. Avoid excessive engine heat buildup: If the engine is experiencing severe and abnormal overheating, stop the vehicle, turn off the engine, and allow it to cool. Seek immediate service and a tune-up to manufacturer's specifications to address the issue, as this can help maintain proper air quality and prevent any potential odors.\n\nBy following these tips, you can help keep the air inside the vehicle fresh and improve the overall cabin environment.",

Leaves, snow, ice or slush can block it, reducing fresh\u2011air flow and allowing stale air to recirculate. | Before you drive, inspect the intake and remove any debris, ice or snow. In winter, brush off any slush that builds up. |\n| **Use the \u201cFresh\u2011Air\u201d or \u201cOutside\u2011Air\u201d setting** (instead of \u201cRecirculate\u201d) | Fresh\u2011air mode pulls in outside air, diluting any pollutants that may have built up inside the car. | Turn the climate\u2011control selector to the fresh\u2011air symbol (often a small arrow pointing outward) whenever you start the car, especially after a long trip or when the cabin feels stuffy. |\n| **Run the blower at a moderate to high speed for a few minutes** | Higher fan speeds move more air through the filter and intake, helping to flush out stale air quickly. | After turning on fresh\u2011air mode, set the front blower to a higher speed for the first 2\u20133\u202fminutes, then adjust to a comfortable level. |\n| **Check and replace the cabin\u2011air filter regularly** | The cabin filter traps dust, pollen, pollen, and other particulates. A clogged filter reduces airflow and can let odors linger. | Locate the filter (usually behind the glove box or under the dash) and inspect it every 12\u202f\u2013\u202f15\u202fmonths (or per the manufacturer\u2019s interval).

This could impair the safety-related systems or result in a loss of vehicle control, leading to an accident.\n\n2. Inappropriate use of Cruise Control: The passage warns against using Cruise Control in heavy traffic, on winding, icy, snow-covered, or slippery roads, as the system may not be able to maintain a constant speed, causing the vehicle to go too fast for the conditions and leading to a loss of control.\n\n3. Rollover risk: The passage highlights that utility vehicles have a significantly higher rollover rate than other types of vehicles due to their higher ground clearance and center of gravity. It warns that if the vehicle goes out of control, it may roll over, which can result in severe or fatal injury.\n\n4. Failure to wear seat belts: The passage emphasizes that failure to use the driver and passenger seat belts provided is a major cause of severe or fatal injury, and in a rollover crash, an unbelted person is significantly more likely to die than a person wearing a seat belt.\n\nIn summary, the key factors that can cause a car to go out of control, as mentioned in the context, are breach of vehicle systems, inappropriate use of Cruise Control, the inherent rollover risk of certain vehicle types, and failure to wear seat belts.",

      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the context provided, the engine oil change indicator system in the vehicle has the following key functions:\n\n1. It monitors the engine operation conditions and determines when the next scheduled oil change is required.\n\n2. When it's time for an oil change, it will display the \"Oil Change Required\" message in the instrument cluster display for 5 seconds, accompanied by a single chime. This alerts the driver that an oil change is needed.\n\n3. The oil change interval is duty cycle-based, meaning it can fluctuate depending on the driver's personal driving style and operating conditions like frequent short trips, towing, or extreme temperatures.\n\n4. Unless the oil change indicator system is reset after the scheduled maintenance is performed, the \"Oil Change Required\" message will continue to display each time the ignition is turned on.\n\n5. To temporarily turn off the message, the driver can push and release the \"OK\" button.\n\n6. To fully reset the oil change indicator system after the scheduled oil change, the driver needs to follow a specific reset procedure.\n\nSo in summary, the engine oil change indicator system automatically monitors the oil life and notifies the driver when it's time for an oil change, based on the actual vehicle operating conditions.",

Adjust your path as needed while you\u2019re driving.  \n\n3. **Maintain control** \u2013 Keep a firm, steady grip on the steering wheel and sit with a good driving posture. This helps you react quickly and keep the vehicle stable.  \n\n4. **Stay aware of what you\u2019re on** \u2013 Continuously remind yourself of the surface you\u2019re currently traversing (e.g., \u201cI\u2019m on loose sand, reduce throttle\u201d) so you can adjust throttle, braking, and steering appropriately.  \n\n5. **Drive smoothly** \u2013 Use gentle throttle inputs and avoid sudden steering or braking movements; smooth inputs keep traction and prevent the vehicle from digging in or sliding.  \n\n6. **Use low gears** \u2013 Engage low\u2011range gearing for better torque control and to keep wheel spin to a minimum on steep or slippery sections.  \n\n7. **Keep momentum** \u2013 When possible, maintain a steady, moderate speed to carry you over obstacles rather than stopping and trying to start again on uneven ground.  \n\n8. **Check your vehicle** \u2013 Before you go, verify tire pressure, fluid levels, and that recovery gear (shovel, tow strap, winch) is on board and in good condition.  \n\nBy combining good preparation, route planning, and disciplined vehicle control, you\u2019ll improve both safety and enjoyment on the trail.",

Check if your vehicle's OBD II system is ready for the inspection:\n   - Cycle the ignition switch to the ON position, but do not crank or start the engine.\n   - Observe the Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) - if it flashes for about 10 seconds and then stays on, your OBD II system is not ready. You should not proceed to the I/M station.\n   - If the MIL does not flash and stays fully illuminated, your OBD II system is ready, and you can proceed to the I/M station.\n\n2. If your OBD II system is not ready:\n   - Drive your vehicle as you normally would to allow the OBD II system to update.\n   - Recheck the readiness with the ignition test procedure.\n   - If the system is still not ready, you should see an authorized dealer or repair facility.\n\n3. Regardless of the OBD II system readiness:\n   - If the MIL is illuminated during normal vehicle operation, have your vehicle serviced before going to the I/M station. The I/M station can fail your vehicle if the MIL is on with the engine running.\n\n4. Ensure your vehicle's exhaust system is in good condition:\n   - Have the exhaust system inspected every time the vehicle is raised.\n   - Have any abnormal conditions repaired promptly.\n   - Until repaired, drive with all side windows fully open to avoid carbon monoxide exposure.\n\nBy following these steps, you can ensure your vehicle is prepared for the emission inspection and avoid potential issues or failures.",

Only do it if absolutely necessary.\n\n2. Know your vehicle's abilities and limitations when it comes to driving across an incline.\n\n3. Driving across an incline places more weight on the downhill wheels, increasing the risk of a downhill slide or rollover.\n\n4. Make sure the surface has good traction with firm and stable soils.\n\n5. If possible, try to transverse the incline at an angle, heading slightly up or down the incline rather than directly across.\n\n6. WARNING: Driving across an incline increases the risk of a rollover, which may result in severe injury. Exercise extreme caution if you have to do this.\n\nThe key advice is to avoid driving across an incline unless absolutely necessary, and if you must do it, be very careful and aware of the increased risks involved.",
      "generated_response": "**If you must cross an incline, follow these safety\u2011first tips to minimise the risk of a rollover or loss of control:**\n\n| Situation | What to Do | Why It Helps |\n|-----------|------------|--------------|\n| **Approach** | \u2022 Reduce speed well before you reach the crest. <br>\u2022 Shift into a low gear (2nd\u20114th for most vehicles) so the engine can provide steady torque without over\u2011revving. | Lower speed gives you more time to react and reduces the lateral forces that can tip the vehicle. A low gear keeps the engine braking the wheels, preventing sudden acceleration that could shift weight abruptly. |\n| **Weight Distribution** | \u2022 Keep heavy cargo, passengers, or equipment as low and as centered as possible. <br>\u2022 If you can, place the heaviest items over the front axle rather than the rear. | A balanced load keeps the centre of gravity (CG) low and centred, reducing the tendency for the downhill wheels to become overloaded and slide or roll. |\n| **Steering** | \u2022 Keep the steering wheel as straight as possible while crossing. <br>\u2022 Avoid sharp or sudden turns at the crest; if a turn is unavoidable, do it gently and at a very low speed. | Straight\u2011ahead steering minimises lateral forces on the wheels. Sudden steering inputs can shift the CG sideways, increasing rollover risk. |\n| **Braking** | \u2022 Do **not** brake while you are on the incline crest. If you need to slow, do it **before** you reach the top. <br>\u2022 Use engine braking (low gear) rather than the foot brake when descending the other side. | Braking on the crest can lock the downhill wheels, causing a slide or a \u201cwheel\u2011lift\u201d that can lead to a rollover. Engine braking provides controlled deceleration without locking wheels. |\n| **Tire Condition** | \u2022 Verify",

Practice turning, stopping, and backing the trailer in a safe, low-traffic area before towing on public roads.\n\n2. If using a manual transmission vehicle for trailer towing, all starts must be in first gear to avoid excessive clutch slippage.\n\n3. Ensure you are not exceeding the Gross Combination Weight Rating (GCWR) - the total weight of the tow vehicle, trailer, cargo, passengers, and equipment must not exceed this limit.\n\n4. Properly distribute the weight between the tow vehicle and trailer to stay within the limits for Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR), Gross Trailer Weight (GTW), and Tongue Weight Rating for the trailer hitch.\n\n5. Always use safety chains, connecting them to the frame or hook retainers of the vehicle hitch, and crossing them under the trailer tongue.\n\n6. Do not tow a trailer at all during the first 500 miles the new vehicle is driven, and for the first 500 miles of trailer towing, do not drive over 50 mph and avoid full throttle starts.\n\n7. Observe state and local laws regarding vehicles under tow, and use only proper towing/lifting equipment designed for this purpose.\n\n8. If the vehicle's battery is discharged, follow the instructions for shifting the automatic transmission out of Park to move the vehicle.",

Shifting loads can destabilize the trailer and make the vehicle hard to control.\n\n6. **Observe warranty guidelines**  \n   - If the vehicle is still under the New\u2011Vehicle Limited Warranty, follow the manual\u2019s towing recommendations so you don\u2019t void coverage.\n\n7. **Follow break\u2011in guidelines**  \n   - New drivetrains often have specific break\u2011in procedures; adhere to any recommended limits on towing distance, speed, and load during the early miles.\n\n8. **Safety first**  \n   - Double\u2011check that lights, brakes, and safety chains (if required) are connected and functioning.  \n   - Keep a safe following distance and drive at moderate speeds, especially when turning or backing up.\n\nBy paying attention to these items you\u2019ll minimize the risk of damage to the towed car, stay within",

Make sure the load is secured in the trailer and will not shift during travel.\n4. Do not overload the vehicle or trailer as it can cause a loss of control, poor performance, or damage to various components.\n5. Always use safety chains between the vehicle and trailer, connecting them to the frame or hook retainers of the vehicle hitch.\n6. Cross the chains under the trailer tongue and allow enough slack for turning corners.\n7. Do not tow a trailer at all during the first 500 miles of driving the new vehicle.\n8. During the first 500 miles (805 km) of towing a trailer, do not drive over 50 mph (80 km/h) and do not make starts at full throttle to help the engine and other parts wear in at heavier loads.",

Check the owner\u2019s manual for any special procedures (neutral, parking brake disengaged, etc.).\n\n5. **Maintain warranty coverage** \u2013 The new\u2011vehicle limited warranty may be voided if you tow in a way that contradicts the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. Follow the manual\u2019s towing requirements to keep the warranty intact.\n\n6. **Secure the load** \u2013 Make sure the towed car is firmly strapped or locked to the tow bar/trailer so it cannot shift or roll during transport. A shifting load can cause loss of control.\n\n7. **Observe break\u2011in guidelines** \u2013 For a brand\u2011new vehicle, the drivetrain may need a proper break\u2011in period before it can be towed. Follow any break\u2011in recommendations in the manual.\n\n8. **Safety first** \u2013  \n   * Verify that lights, brakes and signals on the trailer/towing rig are working.",

      "question": "Can I keep the top folded down for a long time?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the information provided, it is not recommended to keep the top folded down for a long period of time. The key points are:\n\n1. If the temperature is below 72\u00b0F (24\u00b0C) and/or the top has been folded down for a period of time, the top will appear to have shrunk when you raise it, making it difficult to put up. This is caused by a natural contraction of the vinyl or acrylic materials of the fabric top.\n\n2. It is recommended to place the vehicle in a warm area and pull steadily on the top fabric to allow the vinyl to stretch back to its original size before installing the top.\n\n3. The passage states \"Do not lower the top when the temperature is below 41\u00b0F (5\u00b0C). Damage to the top may result.\"\n\nSo in summary, leaving the top folded down for a long time, especially in cold temperatures, can cause the material to contract and make it difficult to raise the top back up again. It is recommended to only fold down the top when necessary and to raise it as soon as possible to avoid potential damage to the material.",
      "generated_response": "No \u2013 it\u2019s best not to leave the top down for an extended period, especially when the weather is cool.  \n\nWhen the top stays folded for a long time (or when the ambient temperature is below about\u202f72\u202f\u00b0F /\u202f24\u202f\u00b0C), the fabric can \u201cshrink\u201d slightly as it cools. When you try to raise it later, it may feel tight and be difficult to pull up properly.  \n\nSo while you can leave the top down for short trips or occasional use, avoid leaving it down for many hours or days in cooler conditions. If you must keep it down for a while, try to keep the vehicle in a warmer environment (e.g., a garage or sunny spot) to minimize the shrinking effect.",

      "ground_truth_answer": "To keep the air inside fresh, make sure the air intake located in front of the windshield is free of obstructions like leaves. Additionally, in winter months, ensure the air intake is clear of ice, slush, and snow. Using the ventilation system properly during humid weather can also help prevent fogging, which can impact air quality.",
      "generated_response": "Here are a few practical steps\u2014based on the information in the manual\u2014to keep the cabin air fresh and free of odors or contaminants:\n\n1. **Keep the outside\u2011air intake clear**  \n   * The intake is located right in front of the windshield. Make sure it isn\u2019t blocked by ice, snow, slush, leaves or other debris. A clean intake lets fresh outside air flow into the cabin and prevents leaves from entering the distribution box and clogging the water drains.\n\n2. **Use the proper ventilation mode**  \n   * When you want fresh air, select the **\u201cFresh\u2011Air\u201d (outside\u2011air) mode** rather than the recirculation mode. This pulls clean outside air through the intake and into the cabin.  \n   * In foggy or misty conditions you can still keep the intake open; just add the **Defrost** or **Mix** mode and increase the front blower speed to clear the windows while still bringing in fresh air.\n\n3. **Maintain the cabin\u2011air filter**  \n   * A clogged or dirty cabin filter reduces airflow and can let dust, pollen, and odors linger inside. Replace or clean the filter according to the service schedule (or sooner if you notice reduced airflow or a musty smell).\n\n4. **Avoid adding unnecessary heat from the A/C system**  \n   * If the air conditioner is on while you\u2019re trying to ventilate, it adds heat to the engine\u2011cooling system, which can raise interior temperatures and make the fresh\u2011air flow feel less effective. Turn the A/C off when you\u2019re simply trying to bring in outside air.\n\n5. **Regularly clean the windshield and side glass**  \n   * Fog or mist on the glass can trap moisture inside the cabin, creating a stale environment. Use **Defrost** or **Mix** mode with a higher blower speed to clear the glass quickly, which also helps expel humid air.\n\n6. **Check the A/C condenser**",

Specifically, the passage states:\n\n\"The voltmeter may show a gauge fluctuation at various engine temperatures. This is caused by the glow plug heating system. The number of cycles and the length of the cycling operation is controlled by the engine control module. Glow plug heater operation can run for several minutes. Once the heater operation is complete the voltmeter needle will stabilize.\"\n\nThe glow plug heating system is controlled by the engine control module and causes the engine temperature and voltmeter reading to fluctuate temporarily during its operation, which can last for several minutes. This is normal behavior and not an indication of a problem with the engine or cooling system.",
      "generated_response": "The temperature gauge is simply reporting the temperature of the engine\u2019s coolant, and it\u2019s normal for that reading to move up and down as the engine goes through its normal heating\u2011and\u2011cooling cycles.  \n\n**What causes the fluctuation?**\n\n| Reason | How it affects the gauge |\n|--------|--------------------------|\n| **Thermostat operation** \u2013 The thermostat opens and closes to keep coolant within a set range. When it opens, cooler coolant from the radiator rushes in and the gauge dips; when it closes, the coolant heats up again and the gauge climbs. |\n| **Changing engine load** \u2013 Accelerating, cruising, idling, or applying the brakes all change how much heat the engine is generating, so the coolant temperature will rise or fall accordingly. |\n| **Ambient temperature** \u2013 Cold outside air cools the radiator faster, warm weather does it more slowly, so the gauge will swing more noticeably in extreme conditions. |\n| **Cooling\u2011system circulation** \u2013 The water pump, fan, and radiator all work together. When the electric fan turns on (often at higher coolant temps) extra cooling is provided, causing a temporary drop in the reading. |\n| **Sensor or gauge tolerance** \u2013 Temperature sensors and the gauge itself have a small built\u2011in tolerance, so you\u2019ll see minor \u201cjitter\u201d even when the system is stable. |\n| **Engine warm\u2011up/cool\u2011down phases** \u2013 During start\u2011up the engine heats quickly, then steadies; after a stop the coolant continues to circulate and slowly cools, producing a gradual decline. |\n\nBecause the gauge is designed to stay within a normal range, these small up\u2011and\u2011down movements are expected and indicate that the cooling system is doing its job. Only a sustained reading that stays",

      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the provided context, here are the key things to pay attention to when operating the jack or changing the wheel:\n\n1. Do not attempt to change a tire on the side of the vehicle close to moving traffic. Pull far enough off the road to avoid the danger of being hit.\n\n2. Being under a jacked-up vehicle is dangerous. The vehicle could slip off the jack and fall on you, causing serious injury or death. Never put any part of your body under a vehicle that is on a jack.\n\n3. If you need to get under a raised vehicle, take the vehicle to a service center where it can be raised on a lift, not a jack.\n\n4. Never start or run the engine while the vehicle is on a jack. The jack is designed only for changing tires, not for lifting the vehicle for service purposes.\n\n5. The vehicle should be jacked on a firm, level surface only. Avoid icy or slippery areas.\n\n6. Do not attempt to raise the vehicle by jacking on locations other than those indicated in the instructions.\n\nAdhering to these safety precautions is crucial when operating the jack or changing the wheel to avoid potentially serious or fatal consequences.",
      "generated_response": "When you use the jack or change a wheel, keep these safety points in mind:\n\n- **Purpose\u2011only use** \u2013 The jack is intended **solely for tire\u2011changing**. Do **not** use it to lift the vehicle for any other service work.  \n- **Stable, level ground** \u2013 Always place the vehicle on a **firm, level surface** before jacking it up. Uneven or soft ground can cause the jack to slip or tip.  \n- **Engine off** \u2013 **Never start or run the engine** while the vehicle is supported by the jack. The vehicle must be completely stationary.  \n- **Follow the jack\u2019s instructions** \u2013 Use the manufacturer\u2011specified lifting points and make sure the jack is fully engaged before you begin to remove or install the wheel.  \n\nBy observing these guidelines you\u2019ll reduce the risk of injury or damage while jacking the vehicle and changing a tire.",

      "question": "Any tips for off-road driving?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the provided context, here are some key tips for off-road driving:\n\n1. Familiarize yourself with the terrain and area before proceeding. Understand the different surface conditions you may encounter (hard-packed dirt, gravel, rocks, sand, mud, snow, etc.) and how they affect your vehicle's steering, handling, and traction.\n\n2. Maintain control of your vehicle by keeping a firm grip on the steering wheel and maintaining good driving posture. Avoid sudden accelerations, turns, or braking.\n\n3. Use your own judgment to determine what is safe, as there may be no road signs, speed limits, or signal lights in off-road environments.\n\n4. Look ahead on the trail for surface obstacles and changes in terrain. Plan your future driving route while being mindful of what you are currently driving over.\n\n5. If you get stuck or high-centered, get out of the vehicle and assess the situation. Try to determine what the vehicle is stuck on and the best way to recover it, such as jacking it up and placing rocks under the tires.\n\n6. When approaching hills, evaluate the grade, traction, and any obstacles on the path. If it looks safe, shift to a lower gear with 4-wheel drive engaged, and proceed with caution, maintaining momentum as you climb.\n\n7. When crossing over large rocks, aim to drive over them with your tires, as the tread is designed to handle the abuse better than the sidewalls.\n\n8. Always wear your seatbelt and ensure any cargo is securely fastened to prevent it from becoming a projectile.\n\n9. Avoid parking your vehicle over dry grass or other combustible materials, as the hot exhaust system can start a fire.",
      "generated_response": "Here are some practical off\u2011road driving tips drawn from the passage:\n\n1. **Know the terrain** \u2013 Before you head out, study the area and understand the types of ground you\u2019ll encounter (rocks, sand, mud, steep grades, etc.).  \n\n2. **Plan your route** \u2013 Visualize the line you\u2019ll take and keep track of what you\u2019re currently driving over so you can adjust your speed and line as needed.  \n\n3. **Maintain control** \u2013 Keep a firm grip on the steering wheel and sit in a good driving posture. This gives you better feedback and quicker reaction time when the vehicle encounters obstacles.  \n\n4. **Stay aware** \u2013 Continuously observe the surface ahead (e.g., hidden ruts, loose rocks) and adjust throttle, braking, and steering accordingly.  \n\n5. **Drive smoothly** \u2013 Avoid sudden inputs; use gentle throttle and brake modulation to keep traction and prevent the vehicle from digging in or sliding.  \n\nBy combining good preparation (knowing the terrain and planning your path) with solid vehicle\u2011control habits (firm grip, proper posture, smooth inputs), you\u2019ll greatly improve your chances of a safe and successful off\u2011road adventure.",
