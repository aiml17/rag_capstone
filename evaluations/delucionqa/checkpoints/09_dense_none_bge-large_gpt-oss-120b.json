      "question": "What should I pay attention to for the clutch pedal?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the provided context, here are the key things to pay attention to regarding the clutch pedal:\n\n1. Fully press the clutch pedal before shifting gears. Pressing the clutch pedal all the way down is necessary when changing gears to prevent damage to the transmission.\n\n2. As you release the clutch pedal, lightly press the accelerator pedal. This coordination of the clutch and accelerator is important for smooth gear shifts.\n\n3. Certain noise from the transmission may be noticeable when the clutch is engaged (pedal released). This noise is normal and not an indication of a problem with the clutch or transmission.\n\n4. Ensure the carpet is securely attached and does not interfere with the operation of the clutch pedal. Unattached or improperly placed carpet could get stuck under the clutch pedal and cause a loss of vehicle control.\n\nIn summary, focus on fully pressing and properly releasing the clutch pedal during gear shifts, be aware of normal transmission noises, and ensure the floor carpet does not impact clutch pedal operation.",
      "generated_response": "**Clutch\u2011pedal checklist**\n\n1. **Use it correctly when shifting**  \n   * Press the clutch **all the way down** before you move the shifter.  \n   * When you let the pedal up, do it **smoothly** and at the same time give the accelerator a light press so the engine can take the load.\n\n2. **Make sure nothing interferes with its travel**  \n   * The floor carpet must be the exact\u2011fit type for your vehicle and must be **securely fastened with its grommets**.  \n   * After installing or reinstalling carpet, **fully depress the clutch (and the other pedals)** to verify that the pedal moves freely and isn\u2019t being blocked by the carpet, folded material, or any objects that might have slipped under it (towels, keys, etc.).  \n\n3. **Keep the pedal area clear**  \n   * Never place loose items on or under the carpet where they could shift into the clutch pedal\u2019s path.  \n   * Regularly inspect the carpet fasteners and the pedal travel for wear or damage that could cause the pedal to stick or become mis\u2011aligned.\n\n**In short:**\u202fFully press the clutch when shifting, release it smoothly while adding a little throttle, and always ensure the carpet is properly installed and free of anything that could obstruct or alter the clutch\u2011pedal\u2019s motion.

        " Shifting Fully press the clutch pedal before shifting gears.  As you release the clutch pedal, lightly press the accelerator pedal.  You should always use FIRST gear when starting from a standing position.  Note: A certain amount of noise from the transmission is normal.  This noise can be most noticeable when the vehicle is idling in NEUTRAL with the clutch engaged (clutch pedal released), but it may also be heard when driving.  The noise may also be more noticeable when the transmission is warm.  This noise is normal and is not an indication of a problem with your clutch or transmission.\n\n Before Climbing A Steep Hill As you approach a hill, consider its grade or steepness.  Determine if it is too steep.  Look to see what the traction is on the hill side trail.  Is the trail straight up and down?  What is on top and the other side?  Are there ruts, rocks, branches or other obstacles on the path?  Can you safely recover the vehicle if something goes wrong?  If everything looks good and you feel confident, shift the transmission into a lower gear with 4L engaged, and proceed with caution, maintaining your momentum as you climb the hill.\n\n Carpet Safety Information Always use carpet designed to fit your vehicle.  Only use carpet that does not interfere with the operation of the pedal assemblies.  Only operate the vehicle when the carpet is securely attached by the grommets so it cannot slip out of position and interfere with the pedal assemblies or impair safe operation of your vehicle in other ways.  WARNING: If operating the vehicle without carpet in place the floor may become hot, and there is a risk of burns.  An improperly attached, damaged, folded, or damaged grommets may cause your carpet to interfere with the accelerator, brake, or clutch pedals and cause a loss of vehicle control.  To prevent SERIOUS INJURY or DEATH: ALWAYS securely attach your carpet using the grommets.  ALWAYS make sure objects cannot fall or slide into the driver\u2019s side floor area when the vehicle is moving.  Objects can become trapped under accelerator, brake, or clutch pedals and could cause a loss of vehicle control.  NEVER place any objects under the carpet (e.g., towels, keys, etc.).  These objects could change the position of the carpet and may cause interference with the accelerator, brake, or clutch pedals.  ONLY install carpet designed to fit your vehicle.  NEVER install carpet that cannot be properly attached and secured to your vehicle.  If the carpet needs to be replaced, only use manufacturer approved carpet for the specific make, model, and year of your vehicle.  If the vehicle carpet has been removed and re-installed, always properly attach carpet to the floor and check that the floor mat fasteners are secure to the vehicle carpet.  Fully depress each pedal to check for interference with the accelerator, brake, or clutch pedals then re-install the floor mats."

      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the provided context, it seems that the ability to deactivate the Daytime Running Lights (DRLs) depends on the specific vehicle and the market it is sold in.\n\nFor vehicles sold in Canada, the context indicates that the headlight switch does not have an \"OFF\" detent. Instead, the headlights will be deactivated when the headlight switch is placed in the parking lights position. However, the DRLs will still be activated along with the front and rear marker lights in this scenario.\n\nThe context also mentions that the DRLs may be deactivated when the parking brake is engaged, and that for vehicles sold in Canada, the DRLs will automatically deactivate when the front fog lights are turned on.\n\nAdditionally, the context states that on some vehicles, the Daytime Running Lights may deactivate or reduce intensity on one side of the vehicle when a turn signal is activated on that side, or on both sides of the vehicle when the hazard warning lights are activated.\n\nHowever, the context does not explicitly state that the DRLs can be manually deactivated by the driver. The information provided suggests that the ability to deactivate the DRLs may be limited or controlled by the vehicle's design and features, rather than being a user-configurable option.\n\nTherefore, based on the given context, it is not clear if the DRLs can be deactivated by the driver.

They stay on whenever the low\u2011beam headlights are off and the transmission is in any gear (automatic) or the vehicle is moving (manual). The only way to \u201cdeactivate\u201d them is to activate a function that automatically disables them (e.g., turning on the fog lights where that feature is programmed).\n\nSo, you cannot manually turn the DRLs off with a switch, but they will automatically deactivate under the conditions listed above (parking brake engaged, front fog lights on, turn\u2011signal/hazard operation, etc.).

The electrical components inside of the key fob may be damaged if the key fob is subjected to strong electrical shocks.  In order to ensure complete effectiveness of the electronic devices inside of the key fob, avoid exposing the key fob to direct sunlight.  Once a key fob is programmed to a vehicle, it cannot be repurposed and reprogrammed to another vehicle.  Only key fobs that are programmed to the vehicle electronics can be used to start and operate the vehicle.  Once a key fob is programmed to a vehicle, it cannot be programmed to any other vehicle.  The system uses a key fob, keyless push button ignition and a Radio Frequency (RF) receiver to prevent unauthorized vehicle operation.  Therefore, only key fobs that are programmed to the vehicle can be used to start and operate the vehicle.  The system cannot reprogram a key fob obtained from another vehicle.  Key Fob The doors have to be open and then closed in order for the vehicle to check for the presence of a key fob; the Key Left Vehicle feature will not activate until all of the doors are closed.  These alerts will not be activated in situations where the vehicle\u2019s engine is left running with the key fob inside."

Push the switch downward to open the window and pull upward to close the window.  The driver door power window switch and the front passenger door power window switch have an Auto-Down feature.  Push the window switch down, past the detent, and release and the window will go down automatically.  Power Window Switches Never leave children unattended in a vehicle, and do not let children play with power windows.  Do not leave the key fob in or near the vehicle, or in a location accessible to children.  Occupants, particularly unattended children, can become entrapped by the windows while operating the power window switches.  Such entrapment may result in serious injury or death.  The power window switches will remain active for up to 10 minutes after the ignition is placed in the OFF position.  Opening either front door will cancel this feature.  There are window switches located on the rear of the center console for the rear passenger windows.\n\n Auto-Down Feature The driver door power window switch and the front passenger door power window switch have an Auto-Down feature.  Push the window switch down, past the detent, and release and the window will go down automatically.  To open the window part way, push the window switch down briefly, without going past the detent, and release it when you want the window to stop.  To stop the window from going all the way down during the Auto-Down operation, pull up on the switch briefly.  WARNING: There is no anti-pinch protection when the window is almost closed.  Be sure to clear all objects from the window before closing.\n\n Power Door Locks \u2014 If Equipped The power door lock switch is located on each front door panel.

      "question": "Any tips about how to keep the air inside fresh?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the given context, here are some tips to help keep the air inside the vehicle fresh:\n\n1. Maintain the outside air intake: Ensure the air intake located in front of the windshield is free of obstructions, such as leaves. Blocked air intake can reduce airflow and potentially lead to issues like water drains getting plugged.\n\n2. Avoid excessive recirculation: Refrain from using the recirculation mode for extended periods without the air conditioning (A/C) on. Prolonged use of recirculation mode can lead to fogging and poor air quality inside the vehicle.\n\n3. Use the climate control system effectively: Utilize the Defrost or Mix mode and increase the front blower speed to clear any fogging on the windows. This helps maintain good visibility and air circulation.\n\n4. Manage the A/C system: If the A/C performance seems lower than expected, check the front of the A/C condenser (located in front of the radiator) for any dirt or insect accumulation. Clean the condenser with a gentle water spray to improve the A/C's effectiveness.\n\n5. Avoid excessive engine heat buildup: If the engine is experiencing severe and abnormal overheating, stop the vehicle, turn off the engine, and allow it to cool. Seek immediate service and a tune-up to manufacturer's specifications to address the issue, as this can help maintain proper air quality and prevent any potential odors.\n\nBy following these tips, you can help keep the air inside the vehicle fresh and improve the overall cabin environment.",
      "generated_response": "Here are a few practical steps\u2014drawn directly from the vehicle\u2011climate guidelines\u2014to keep the cabin air clean and fresh:\n\n1. **Keep the outside\u2011air intake clear**  \n   * The intake is right in front of the windshield. Make sure it isn\u2019t blocked by leaves, snow, ice or slush. A clean intake lets fresh outside air flow into the HVAC system and prevents debris from reaching the air\u2011distribution box where it could clog the water drains.\n\n2. **Use the proper ventilation mode**  \n   * For most of the drive, select the **\u201cFresh\u2011air\u201d (outside) mode** rather than the Recirculation (REC) mode.  \n   * **Avoid long periods in Recirculation without the A/C** \u2013 the cabin can become humid and foggy, which also means the air quality degrades. If you need to use Recirculation (e.g., heavy traffic smoke), keep the A/C on so the system can de\u2011humidify and filter the air.\n\n3. **Run the A/C (even in cold weather) when needed**  \n   * The A/C compressor removes moisture from the incoming air, which helps prevent fogging and reduces the amount of stale, humid air inside the cabin.  \n   * When you notice fog or mist on the windshield, switch to **Defrost mode**, turn the blower to a higher speed, and keep the A/C engaged.\n\n4. **Maintain the HVAC filters**  \n   * Although not explicitly mentioned in the excerpt, a clean cabin\u2011air filter is essential for fresh air. Replace it according to the manufacturer\u2019s schedule or sooner if you drive in dusty or pollen\u2011heavy environments.\n\n5. **Keep the condenser and radiator clean**  \n   * A dirty front\u2011mounted A/C condenser can reduce cooling efficiency, which in turn limits the system\u2019s ability to de\u2011humidify and refresh cabin air. Periodically spray the front of the radiator/condenser with gentle water to clear",
      "retrieved_chunks": [
        " Outside Air Intake Make sure the air intake, located directly in front of the windshield, is free of obstructions, such as leaves.  Leaves collected in the air intake may reduce airflow, and if they enter the air distribution box, they could plug the water drains.  In Winter months, make sure the air intake is clear of ice, slush, and snow.\n\n Window Fogging Vehicle windows tend to fog on the inside in mild, rainy, and/or humid weather.  To clear the windows, select Defrost or Mix mode and increase the front blower speed.  Do not use the Recirculation mode without A/C for long periods, as fogging may occur.\n\n On the highways \u2014 slow down.  In city traffic \u2014 while stopped, place the transmission in NEUTRAL (N), but do not increase the engine idle speed while preventing vehicle motion with the brakes.  If your Air Conditioner (A/C) is on, turn it off.  The A/C system adds heat to the engine cooling system and turning the A/C off can help remove this heat.  You can also turn the temperature control to maximum heat, the mode control to floor and the blower control to high.  This allows the heater core to act as a supplement to the radiator and aids in removing heat from the engine cooling system.  For Manual Climate Controls, if the system is in Mix, Floor or Defrost Mode, the A/C can be turned off, but the A/C system shall remain active to prevent fogging of the windows.  If fog or mist appears on the windshield or side glass, select Defrost mode, and increase blower speed if needed.  If your air conditioning performance seems lower than expected, check the front of the A/C condenser (located in front of the radiator), for an accumulation of dirt or insects.  Clean with a gentle water spray from the front of the radiator and through the condenser.  In unusual situations involving grossly malfunctioning engine operation, a scorching odor may suggest severe and abnormal catalyst overheating.  If this occurs, stop the vehicle, turn off the engine and allow it to cool.  Service, including a tune-up to manufacturer's specifications, should be obtained immediately."

If the ABS Warning Light remains on or comes on while driving, it indicates that the anti-lock portion of the brake system is not functioning and that service is required.  However, the conventional brake system will continue to operate normally if the ABS Warning Light is on.  If the Brake Warning Light remains on with the parking brake released, a brake system malfunction is indicated.  Have the brake system serviced by an authorized dealer immediately.  When the parking brake is applied with the ignition switch ON, the Brake Warning Light in the instrument cluster will illuminate.  This warning light will turn on when there's a fault with the EPS system"

Road conditions such as ice, snow, gravel, bumps, railroad tracks, loose debris, or panic stops may increase the likelihood of ABS activation(s).  You also may experience the following normal characteristics when the ABS activates: If the ABS Warning Light is on, the brake system should be serviced as soon as possible to restore the benefits of Anti-Lock Brakes.  If the ABS Warning Light does not come on when the ignition is placed in the ON/RUN mode, have the light repaired as soon as possible.  This warning light monitors the ABS.  The light will turn on when the ignition is placed in the ON/RUN or ACC/ON/RUN position and may stay on for as long as four seconds.  The yellow ABS Warning Light will turn on when the ignition is placed in the ON/RUN mode and may stay on for as long as four seconds.  Vehicles equipped with the Anti-Lock Brake System (ABS) are also equipped with Electronic Brake Force Distribution (EBD).  In the event of an EBD failure, the Brake Warning Light will turn on along with the ABS Light.  Immediate repair to the ABS system is required.  If the ABS light does not turn on when the ignition is placed in the ON/RUN or ACC/ON/RUN position, have the brake system inspected by an authorized dealer.  The ABS performs a self-check cycle to ensure that the ABS is working properly each time the vehicle is started and driven.  During this self-check, you may hear a slight clicking sound, as well as some related motor noises.  The ABS provides increased vehicle stability and brake performance under most braking conditions.  The system automatically prevents wheel lock and enhances vehicle control during braking.  The BAS is designed to optimize the vehicle\u2019s braking capability during emergency braking maneuvers.  The system detects an emergency braking situation by sensing the rate and amount of brake application, and then applies optimum pressure to the brakes.  This can help reduce braking distances.  The BAS complements the Anti-Lock Brake System (ABS) by applying the brakes very quickly, creating the most efficient braking assistance possible.  To receive the benefit of the system, you must apply continuous braking pressure during the stopping sequence (do not \u201cpump\u201d the brakes).  Do not reduce brake pedal pressure unless braking is no longer desired.

        " Windshield Wiper Operation Rotate the end of the lever upward to the first detent past the intermittent settings for low-speed wiper operation.  Rotate the end of the lever upward to the second detent past the intermittent settings for high-speed wiper operation.  CAUTION: In cold weather, always turn off the wiper switch and allow the wipers to return to the park position before turning off the engine.  If the wiper switch is left on and the wipers freeze to the windshield, damage to the wiper motor may occur when the vehicle is restarted.  Mist Push upward on the wiper lever to activate a single wipe to clear off-road mist or spray from a passing vehicle.  As long as the lever is held up, the wipers will continue to operate.  For information on wiper care and replacement, see Note: The mist feature does not activate the washer pump; therefore, no washer fluid will be sprayed on the windshield.  The washer function must be used in order to spray the windshield with washer fluid.  WINDSHIELD WIPERS AND WASHERS The windshield wiper/washer control lever is located on the right side of the steering column; it operates the multiple wiper options.  The front wipers are operated by rotating a switch, located at the end of the lever.\n\n Windshield Washers To use the washer, pull the lever toward you and hold until desired spray is reached.  If the lever is pulled while in the delay range, the wiper will start and continue to operate for two or three wipe cycles after the lever is released.  Then, the intermittent interval previously selected will resume.  If the lever is pulled while in the off position, the wipers will operate for two or three wipe cycles.  Then, the wipers will turn off.  Note: As a protective measure, the washer will stop if the switch is held for more than 20 seconds.  Once the switch is released the washer will resume normal operation.  WARNING: Sudden loss of visibility through the windshield could lead to a collision.  You might not see other vehicles or other obstacles.

        " To Arm The System Follow these steps to arm the Vehicle Security system: Make sure the vehicle\u2019s ignition is placed in the OFF position.  Perform one of the following methods to lock the vehicle: push the lock button on the interior power door lock switch with the driver and/or passenger door open.  Push the lock button on the exterior Passive Entry door handle with a valid key fob available in the same exterior zonePush the lock button on the key fob.  If any doors are open, close them.  Note: The Vehicle Security system will not arm if you lock the doors using the manual door lock.\n\n To Arm The System Follow these steps to arm the Vehicle Security system: Make sure the vehicle\u2019s ignition is placed in the OFF position.  Perform one of the following methods to lock the vehicle: push the lock button on the interior power door lock switch with the driver and/or passenger door open.  Push the lock button on the exterior Passive Entry door handle with a valid key fob available in the same exterior zone Push the lock button on the key fob.  If any doors are open, close them.  Note: The Vehicle Security system will not arm if you lock the doors using the manual door lock.  VEHICLE SECURITY SYSTEM \u2014 IF EQUIPPED The Vehicle Security system monitors the vehicle doors for unauthorized entry and the ignition switch for unauthorized operation.  When the system is activated, the interior switches for door locks are disabled.  The Vehicle Security system provides both audible and visible signals.  If something triggers the alarm, the Vehicle Security system will provide the following audible and visible signals: the horn will pulse, the parking lights and/or turn signals will flash, and the Vehicle Security Light in the instrument cluster will flash.  SENTRY KEY The Sentry Key Immobilizer system prevents unauthorized vehicle operation by disabling the engine.  The system does not need to be armed or activated.  Operation is automatic, regardless of whether the vehicle is locked or unlocked.  The system uses a key fob, keyless push button ignition and a Radio Frequency (RF) receiver to prevent unauthorized vehicle operation.  Therefore, only key fobs that are programmed to the vehicle can be used to start and operate the vehicle.  The system cannot reprogram a key fob obtained from another vehicle.  After placing the ignition switch in the ON/RUN position, the Vehicle Security Light will turn on for three seconds for a bulb check.  If the light remains on after the bulb check, it indicates that there is a problem with the electronics.  In addition, if the light begins to flash after the bulb check, it indicates that someone attempted to start the engine with an invalid key fob.  In the event that a valid key fob is used to start the engine but there is an issue with the vehicle electronics, the engine will start and shut off after two seconds.  If the Vehicle Security Light turns on during normal vehicle operation (vehicle running for longer than ten seconds), it indicates that there is a fault in the electronics.  Should this occur, have the vehicle serviced as soon as possible by an authorized dealer.  All of the key fobs provided with your new vehicle have been programmed to the vehicle electronics CAUTION: The Sentry Key Immobilizer system is not compatible with some aftermarket remote starting systems.  Use of these systems may result in vehicle starting problems and loss of security protection.  Note: A key fob that has not been programmed is also considered an invalid key.\n\n To Disarm The System The Vehicle Security system can be disarmed using any of the following methods: Push the unlock button on the key fob.  Grab the Passive Entry door handle (if equipped) Cycle the vehicle ignition system out of the OFF position.  The Vehicle Security system is designed to protect your vehicle.  However, you can create conditions where the system will give you a false alarm.  If one of the previously described arming sequences has occurred, the Vehicle Security system will arm regardless of whether you are in the vehicle or not.  If you remain in the vehicle and open a door, the alarm will sound.  If this occurs, disarm the Vehicle Security system.  If the Vehicle Security system is armed and the battery becomes disconnected, the Vehicle Security system will remain armed when the battery is reconnected; the exterior lights will flash, and the horn will sound.  If this occurs, disarm the Vehicle Security system.  Note: The driver's door key cylinder cannot arm or disarm the Vehicle Security system.  When the Vehicle Security system is armed, the interior power door lock switches will not unlock the doors.  Vehicle Security Warning Light \u2014 If Equipped This light will flash at a fast rate for approximately 15 seconds when the vehicle security system is arming, and then will flash slowly until the vehicle is disarmed.  Rearming Of The System If something triggers the alarm and no action is taken to disarm it, the Vehicle Security system will turn the horn off after a 29 second cycle (with five seconds between cycles and up to eight cycles if the trigger remains active) and then rearm itself."

GVWR GTW GAWR Tongue weight rating for the trailer hitch utilized Position the truck to be ready to connect to the trailer (do not connect the trailer).  Measure the height from the top of the front fender to ground, this is height H1.  Measuring Height (H) Attach the trailer to the vehicle without the weight distribution bars connected.  Measure the height from the top of the front fender to ground, this is height H2.  Install and adjust the tension in the weight distributing bars per the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations so that the height of the front fender is approximately H1 (H2=H1).  The truck can now be driven.\n\n Gross Combination Weight Rating (GCWR) The GCWR is the total permissible weight of your vehicle and trailer when weighed in combination.  Trailer And Tongue Weight Never exceed the maximum tongue weight stamped on your bumper or trailer hitch.  Consider the following items when computing the weight on the rear axle of the vehicle: the tongue weight of the trailer the weight of any other type of cargo or equipment put in or on your vehicle the weight of the driver and all passengers note: remember that everything put into or on the trailer adds to the load on your vehicle.  Also, additional factory-installed options or dealer-installed options must be considered as part of the total load on your vehicle.  Refer to the Tire And Loading Information Placard for the maximum combined weight of occupants and cargo for your vehicle.  Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR) The GVWR is the total permissible weight of your vehicle including driver, passengers, vehicle, options and cargo.  The label also specifies maximum capacities of front and rear Gross Axle Weight Rating (GAWR).  Total load must be limited so GVWR on front and rear GAWR are not exceeded."

        " Shifting Fully press the clutch pedal before shifting gears.  As you release the clutch pedal, lightly press the accelerator pedal.  You should always use FIRST gear when starting from a standing position.  Note: A certain amount of noise from the transmission is normal.  This noise can be most noticeable when the vehicle is idling in NEUTRAL with the clutch engaged (clutch pedal released), but it may also be heard when driving.  The noise may also be more noticeable when the transmission is warm.  This noise is normal and is not an indication of a problem with your clutch or transmission.\n\n Automatic Transmission \u2014 If Equipped\n\n Transmission function is monitored electronically for abnormal conditions.  If a condition is detected that could result in transmission damage, Transmission Limp Home mode is activated.  In this mode, the transmission may operate only in certain gears, or may not shift at all.  Vehicle performance may be severely degraded and the engine may stall.  In some situations, the transmission may not re-engage if the engine is turned off and restarted.  The Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) may be illuminated.  A message in the instrument cluster will inform the driver of the more serious conditions, and indicate what actions may be necessary.  It is important to use the proper transmission fluid to ensure optimum transmission performance and life.  Use only manufacturer's specified transmission fluid It is important to maintain the transmission fluid at the correct level using the recommended fluid.  Using a transmission fluid other than manufacturer\u2019s recommended fluid may cause deterioration in transmission shift quality and/or torque converter shudder Continuous driving with the Transmission Temperature Warning Light illuminated will eventually cause severe transmission damage or transmission failure.  If you continue to operate the vehicle when the CLUTCH HOT message is displayed or Transmission Temperature Warning Light is illuminated, you could cause the clutch to overheat and cause severe clutch damage, transmission damage or failure.  Using a lower gear while operating the vehicle under heavy loading conditions, will improve performance and extend transmission life by reducing excessive shifting and heat build-up.  This action will also provide better engine braking.  Towing the vehicle, coasting, or driving for any other reason with the transmission in NEUTRAL can cause severe transmission damage.  For Recreational Towing For Towing A Disabled Vehicle When frequent transmission shifting occurs (such as when operating the vehicle under heavy loading conditions, in hilly terrain, traveling into strong head winds, or while towing a heavy trailer), use the AutoStick shift control to select a lower gear Under these conditions, using a lower gear will improve performance and extend transmission life by reducing excessive shifting and heat build-up.  Racing the engine or spinning the wheels may lead to transmission overheating and failure.  Allow the engine to idle with the transmission in NEUTRAL (N) for at least one minute after every five rocking-motion cycles.  This will minimize overheating and reduce the risk of clutch or transmission failure during prolonged efforts to free a stuck vehicle.  When \u201crocking\u201d a stuck vehicle by shifting between DRIVE/SECOND gear and REVERSE, do not spin the wheels faster than 15 mph (24 km/h), or drivetrain damage may result.  Revving the engine or spinning the wheels too fast may lead to transmission overheating and failure.  It can also damage the tires.  Do not spin the wheels above 30 mph (48 km/h) while in gear (no transmission shifting occurring).  During cold weather, you may experience increased effort in shifting until the transmission fluid warms up.  This is normal.  Routine fluid and filter changes are not required.  However, change the fluid and filter if the fluid becomes contaminated (with water, etc.  ), or if the transmission is disassembled for any reason."

Evaluate the latest driving cycles (distance, driving time and parking time).  The vehicle should have service performed if the message is still present during consecutive trips and the evaluation of the vehicle and driving pattern did not help to identify the cause.\n\n Never use the PARK position as a substitute for the parking brake.  Always apply the parking brake fully when exiting the vehicle to guard against vehicle movement and possible injury or damage.  Your vehicle could move and injure you and others if it is not in PARK.  Check by trying to move the transmission gear selector out of PARK with the brake pedal released.  Make sure the transmission is in PARK before exiting the vehicle.  The transmission may not engage PARK if the vehicle is moving.  Always bring the vehicle to a complete stop before shifting to PARK, and verify that the transmission gear position indicator solidly indicates PARK (P) without blinking.  Ensure that the vehicle is completely stopped, and the PARK position is properly indicated, before exiting the vehicle.  It is dangerous to shift out of PARK or NEUTRAL if the engine speed is higher than idle speed.  If your foot is not firmly pressing the brake pedal, the vehicle could accelerate quickly forward or in reverse.  You could lose control of the vehicle and hit someone or something.  Only shift into gear when the engine is idling normally and your foot is firmly pressing the brake pedal.  Unintended movement of a vehicle could injure those in or near the vehicle.  As with all vehicles, you should never exit a vehicle while the engine is running.  Before exiting a vehicle, always come to a complete stop, then apply the parking brake, shift the transmission into PARK, and turn the ignition OFF.  When the ignition is in the OFF position, the transmission is locked in PARK, securing the vehicle against unwanted movement.  When exiting the vehicle, always make sure the ignition is in the OFF position, remove the key fob from the vehicle, and lock the vehicle.  Never leave children alone in a vehicle, or with access to an unlocked vehicle.  Allowing children to be in a vehicle unattended is dangerous for a number of reasons.  A child or others could be seriously or fatally injured.  Children should be warned not to touch the parking brake, brake pedal or the transmission gear selector.  Do not leave the key fob in or near the vehicle (or in a location accessible to children), and do not leave the ignition in the ACC or ON/RUN position.  A child could operate power windows, other controls, or move the vehicle.  Always do a visual check that your vehicle is in park by looking for the \u201cp\u201d in the instrument cluster display and on the gear selector.  As an added precaution, always apply the parking brake when exiting the vehicle.  Check engine oil level.  Check windshield washer fluid level.  Check the tire pressures and look for unusual wear or damage, rotate at the first sign of irregular wear.  Check the fluid levels of the coolant reservoir, brake master cylinder, and power steering, and fill as needed.  Check function of all interior and exterior lights."

        " Off-Road Driving Tips\n\n The Basics Of Off-Road Driving You will encounter many types of terrain driving off-road.  You should be familiar with the terrain and area before proceeding.  There are many types of surface conditions: hard-packed dirt, gravel, rocks, grass, sand, mud, snow and ice.  Every surface has a different effect on your vehicle's steering, handling and traction.  Controlling your vehicle is one of the keys to successful off-road driving, so always keep a firm grip on the steering wheel and maintain a good driving posture.  Avoid sudden accelerations, turns or braking.  In most cases, there are no road signs, posted speed limits or signal lights.  Therefore, you will need to use your own good judgment on what is safe and what is not.  When on a trail, you should always be looking ahead for surface obstacles and changes in terrain.  The key is to plan your future driving route while remembering what you are currently driving over.  Note: It is recommended that the Stop/Start system be disabled during off-road use.  WARNING: Always wear your seat belt and firmly tie down cargo.  Unsecured cargo can become projectiles in an off-road situation.  CAUTION: Never park your vehicle over dry grass or other combustible materials.  The heat from your vehicle exhaust system could cause a fire.\n\n If you get hung up or high-centered on an object, get out of the vehicle and try to determine what the vehicle is hung up on, where it is contacting the underbody and what is the best direction to recover the vehicle.  Depending on what you are in contact with, jack the vehicle up and place a few rocks under the tires so the weight is off of the high point when you let the vehicle down.  You can also try rocking the vehicle or winching the vehicle off the object.  You will encounter many types of terrain driving off-road.

The key is to plan your future driving route while remembering what you are currently driving over.  As you approach a hill, consider its grade or steepness.  Determine if it is too steep.  Look to see what the traction is on the hill side trail.  Is the trail straight up and down?  What is on top and the other side?  Are there ruts, rocks, branches or other obstacles on the path?  Can you safely recover the vehicle if something goes wrong?  If everything looks good and you feel confident, shift the transmission into a lower gear with 4L engaged, and proceed with caution, maintaining your momentum as you climb the hill.  When approaching large rocks, choose a path which ensures you drive over the largest of them with your tires.  This will lift your undercarriage over the obstacle.  The tread of the tire is tougher and thicker than the side wall and is designed to take the abuse.  Always look ahead and make every effort to cross the large rocks with your tires."

Voice commands are required after most Uconnect Phone prompts.  There are two general methods for how Voice Command works: Prior to giving a voice command, one must wait for the beep, which follows the \u201cListen\u201d prompt or another prompt.  For certain operations, compound commands can be used.  For example, instead of saying \u201cCall\u201d and then \u201cJohn Smith\u201d and then \u201cmobile\u201d, the following compound command can be said: \u201cCall John Smith mobile.\u201d For each feature explanation in this section, only the compound command form of the voice command is given.  You can also break the commands into parts and say each part of the command when you are asked for it.  For example, you can use the compound command form voice command \u201cSearch for John Smith,\u201d or you can break the compound command form into two voice commands: \u201cSearch Contacts\u201d and when asked, \u201cJohn Smith.\u201d Please remember, the Uconnect Phone works best when you talk in a normal conversational tone, as if speaking to someone sitting a few feet/meters away from you.

        " In some localities, it may be a legal requirement to pass an inspection of your vehicle's emissions control system.  Failure to pass could prevent vehicle registration.  Do not inhale exhaust gases.  They contain carbon monoxide, a colorless and odorless gas, which can kill.  Never run the engine in a closed area, such as a garage, and never sit in a parked vehicle with the engine running for an extended period.  If the vehicle is stopped in an open area with the engine running for more than a short period, adjust the ventilation system to force fresh, outside air into the vehicle.  Guard against carbon monoxide with proper maintenance.  Have the exhaust system inspected every time the vehicle is raised.  Have any abnormal conditions repaired promptly.  Until repaired, drive with all side windows fully open.  Your vehicle is equipped with a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system to meet the very stringent diesel emissions standards required by the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\n EMISSIONS INSPECTION AND MAINTENANCE PROGRAMS In some localities, it may be a legal requirement to pass an inspection of your vehicle's emissions control system.  Failure to pass could prevent vehicle registration.  For states and/or provinces that require an Inspection and Maintenance (I/M), this check verifies the Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) is functioning and is not on when the engine is running, and that the OBD II system is ready for testing.  The obd ii system may not be ready if your vehicle was recently serviced, recently had a depleted battery or a battery replacement.  If the OBD II system should be determined not ready for the I/M test, your vehicle may fail the test.  Your vehicle has a simple ignition actuated test, which you can use prior to going to the test station.  To check if your vehicle's OBD II system is ready, you must do the following: Cycle the ignition switch to the ON position, but do not crank or start the engine.  Note: if you crank or start the engine, you will have to start this test over.  As soon as you cycle the ignition switch to the ON position, you will see the Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) symbol come on as part of a normal bulb check.  Approximately 15 seconds later, one of two things will happen: the mil will flash for about 10 seconds and then return to being fully illuminated until you turn off the ignition or start the engine.  This means that your vehicle's obd ii system is not ready and you should not proceed to the i/m station.  The MIL will not flash at all and will remain fully illuminated until you place the ignition in the off position or start the engine.  This means that your vehicle's obd ii system is ready and you can proceed to the i/m station.  If your obd ii system is not ready, you should see an authorized dealer or repair facility.  If your vehicle was recently serviced or had a battery failure or replacement, you may need to do nothing more than drive your vehicle as you normally would in order for your OBD II system to update.  A recheck with the previously mentioned test routine may then indicate that the system is now ready.  Regardless of whether your vehicle's OBD II system is ready, if the MIL is illuminated during normal vehicle operation you should have your vehicle serviced before going to the I/M station.

The push button ignition can be placed in the following modes: Enhanced Accident Response System Reset Procedure In order to reset the Enhanced Accident Response System functions after an event, the ignition switch must be changed from ignition START or ON/RUN to ignition OFF.  Carefully check the vehicle for fuel leaks in the engine compartment and on the ground near the engine compartment and fuel tank before resetting the system and starting the engine.  After an accident, if the vehicle will not start after performing the reset procedure, the vehicle must be towed to an authorized dealer to be inspected and to have the Enhanced Accident Response System reset.\n\n EMISSIONS INSPECTION AND MAINTENANCE PROGRAMS In some localities, it may be a legal requirement to pass an inspection of your vehicle's emissions control system.

Power Outlets There is a 12 Volt (13 A) auxiliary power outlet that can provide power for accessories designed for use with the standard power outlet adapters.  The front power outlet is located in the center of the instrument panel below the climate controls, and is powered from the ignition switch.  Power is available when the ignition switch is in the ACC or ON/RUN position.  WARNING: To avoid serious injury or death: Do not insert any objects into the receptacles.  Do not touch with wet hands.  Close the lid when not in use.  If this outlet is mishandled, it may cause an electric shock and failure.  CAUTION: Do not exceed the maximum power of 160 W (13 A) at 12 Volts.  If the 160 W (13 A) power rating is exceeded, the fuse protecting the system will need to be replaced.  Power outlets are designed for accessory plugs only.  Do not insert any other object in the power outlets as this will damage the outlet and blow the fuse.  Improper use of the power outlet can cause damage not covered by your New Vehicle Limited Warranty.  Many accessories that can be plugged in draw power from the vehicle's battery, even when not in use (i.e., cellular phones, etc.).  Eventually, if plugged in long enough, the vehicle's battery will discharge sufficiently to degrade battery life and/or prevent the engine from starting.  Accessories that draw higher power (i.e., coolers, vacuum cleaners, lights, etc.  ), will degrade the battery even more quickly.  Only use these intermittently and with greater caution.  After the use of high power draw accessories, or long periods of the vehicle not being started (with accessories still plugged in), the vehicle must be driven a sufficient length of time to allow the alternator to recharge the vehicle's battery.  Power outlets are designed for accessory plugs only.  Do not hang any type of accessory or accessory bracket from the plug.  Improper use of the power outlet can cause damage Extreme Cold Weather (Below \u201322\u00b0F Or \u221230\u00b0C) To ensure reliable starting at these temperatures, use of an externally powered electric engine block heater (available from an authorized dealer) is recommended.\n\n The cartridge block heater clips into the engine block near the water jacket and transfers heat to the coolant.

Until repaired, drive with all side windows fully open.  Charge Air Cooler \u2014 Inter-Cooler (Diesel Engine) The charge air cooler is positioned in front of the radiator and the air conditioner condenser.  Air enters the engine through the air cleaner and passes through the turbocharger, where it is pressurized.  This pressurized air rapidly reaches high temperature.  The air is then directed through a hose to the charge air cooler and through another hose to the intake manifold of the engine.  This cooling process enables more efficient burning of fuel resulting in fewer emissions.  To guarantee optimum performance of the system, keep the surfaces of the charge air cooler, condenser and radiator clean and free of debris.  Periodically check the hoses leading to and from the charge air cooler for cracks or loose clamps resulting in loss of pressure and reduced engine performance."

In short, an improperly latched tailgate puts both the truck and its load at risk.\n\n**What to do**\n\n1. **Stop and check** \u2013 As soon as you notice the tailgate isn\u2019t fully latched, stop the vehicle in a safe place.  \n2. **Pull back on the gate** \u2013 Grasp the tailgate and pull it backward firmly; this tests whether the latch has caught.  \n3. **Lift it up again** \u2013 Raise the tailgate until both sides click into place. You should hear a distinct \u201cclunk\u201d as each latch engages.  \n4. **Verify** \u2013 Give the gate a firm tug again to confirm it\u2019s locked.  \n5. **Inspect** \u2013 Look for any visible damage to the latch, hinges, or surrounding trim. If anything looks bent, cracked, or worn, have it inspected by a qualified technician.\n\n**Why it matters**\n\n- **Vehicle damage:** Repeatedly forcing a partially latched gate can bend the latch hardware, warp the tailgate frame, or damage the surrounding body panels.  \n- **Cargo loss:** An unsecured gate can swing open, spilling or crushing whatever you\u2019re transporting.  \n- **Safety hazard:** A suddenly opening tailgate while driving can create a dangerous situation for you and other road users.\n\nSo, always make sure the tailgate is fully latched\u2014pull back on it after closing, listen for the latch engagement, and re\u2011close it if you\u2019re unsure.

Each time the heater is on, it draws current and the voltmeter (or the temperature gauge that is tied to the same circuit) will move a little. When the heater turns off, the needle settles again.

This reduces the lateral load on the downhill wheels.\n\n5. **Keep the wheels planted**  \n   * Maintain a steady, moderate throttle; don\u2019t accelerate hard or \u201crace\u201d across.  \n   * If you feel the downhill wheels starting to lift or slip, ease off the throttle and gently steer back toward the uphill side to regain bite.\n\n6. **Use proper braking**  \n   * Apply brakes lightly if needed, but avoid locking the tires.  \n   * Never descend or cross a steep grade in neutral; keep the transmission engaged (4L or low gear) so engine braking can help.\n\n7. **Stay aware of rollover risk** \u2013 Even with all precautions, crossing an incline is one of the situations most likely to cause a rollover. Keep your speed low, keep the center of gravity as low as possible, and be prepared to stop if the surface feels unsafe.\n\n8. **Plan an escape route** \u2013 Make sure there\u2019s enough clear space on the downhill side to stop or regain control if the vehicle starts to slide.\n\n**Bottom line:** Only cross an incline when it\u2019s absolutely necessary, after confirming traction, vehicle capability, and a safe angle of approach. Drive slowly, keep the vehicle in low gear, and be ready to abort if the wheels begin to lose grip.",

        " Driving Across An Incline If at all possible, avoid driving across an incline.  If it is necessary, know your vehicle's abilities.  Driving across an incline places more weight on the downhill wheels, which increases the possibilities of a downhill slide or rollover.  Make sure the surface has good traction with firm and stable soils.  If possible, transverse the incline at an angle heading slightly up or down.  WARNING: Driving across an incline increases the risk of a rollover, which may result in severe injury.\n\n Driving Across An Incline If at all possible, avoid driving across an incline.  If it is necessary, know your vehicle's abilities.  Driving across an incline places more weight on the downhill wheels, which increases the possibilities of a downhill slide or rollover.  Make sure the surface has good traction with firm and stable soils.  If possible, transverse the incline at an angle heading slightly up or down.  WARNING: Driving across an incline increases the risk of a rollover, which may result in severe injury.  Driving Downhill Before driving down a steep hill, you need to determine if it is too steep for a safe descent.  What is the surface traction?  Is the grade too steep to maintain a slow, controlled descent?  Are there obstacles?  Is it a straight descent?  Is there plenty of distance at the base of the hill to regain control if the vehicle descends too fast?  If you feel confident in your ability to proceed, then make sure you are in 4L and proceed with caution.  Allow engine braking to control the descent and apply your brakes, if necessary, but do not allow the tires to lock.  WARNING: Do not descend a steep grade in NEUTRAL.  Use vehicle brakes in conjunction with engine braking.  Descending a grade too fast could cause you to lose control and be seriously injured or killed.  Off-Road Driving Tips\n\n Driving Up Hill Once you have determined your ability to proceed and have shifted into the appropriate gear, line your vehicle up for the straightest possible run.  Accelerate with an easy constant throttle and apply more power as you start up the hill.  Do not race forward into a steep grade; the abrupt change of grade could cause you to lose control.  If the front end begins to bounce, ease off the throttle slightly to bring all four tires back on the ground.  As you approach the crest of the hill, ease off the throttle and slowly proceed over the top.  If the wheels start to slip as you approach the crest of a hill, ease off the accelerator and maintain headway by turning the steering wheel no more than a quarter turn quickly back and forth.  This will provide a fresh \"bite\" into the surface and will usually provide enough traction to complete the climb.  If you do not make it to the top, place the vehicle in REVERSE and back straight down the grade using engine resistance along with the vehicle brakes.  WARNING: Never attempt to climb a hill at an angle or turn around on a steep grade.  Driving across an incline increases the risk of a rollover, which may result in severe injury."

      "retrieved_chunks": [
        " For the recommended viscosity and quality grades seeThe Treadwear grade is a comparative rating, based on the wear rate of the tire when tested under controlled conditions on a specified government test course.  For example, a tire graded 150 would wear one and one-half times as well on the government course as a tire graded 100.  The relative performance of tires depends upon the actual conditions of their use, however, and may depart significantly from the norm due to variations in driving habits, service practices, and differences in road characteristics and climate.  The following tire grading categories were established by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.  The specific grade rating assigned by the tire's manufacturer in each category is shown on the sidewall of the tires on your vehicle.  The Traction grades, from highest to lowest, are AA, A, B, and C. These grades represent the tire's ability to stop on wet pavement, as measured under controlled conditions on specified government test surfaces of asphalt and concrete.  A tire marked C may have poor traction performance.  Sustained high temperature can cause the material of the tire to degenerate and reduce tire life, and excessive temperature can lead to sudden tire failure.  The grade C corresponds to a level of performance, which all passenger vehicle tires must meet under the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 109. Grades B and A represent higher levels of performance on the laboratory test wheel, than the minimum required by law.  The Temperature grades are A (the highest), B, and C, representing the tire's resistance to the generation of heat and its ability to dissipate heat, when tested under controlled conditions on a specified indoor laboratory test wheel.  The traction grade assigned to this tire is based on straight-ahead braking traction tests, and does not include acceleration, cornering, hydroplaning, or peak traction characteristics.  All passenger vehicle tires must conform to Federal safety requirements in addition to these grades.  For devices which are not made a favorite, the device priority is determined by the order in which it was paired.  The most recent device paired will have the higher priority.\n\n Temperature Grades The Temperature grades are A (the highest), B, and C, representing the tire's resistance to the generation of heat and its ability to dissipate heat, when tested under controlled conditions on a specified indoor laboratory test wheel.

If using a manual transmission vehicle for trailer towing, all starts must be in first gear to avoid excessive clutch slippage.  TRAILER TOWING In this section you will find safety tips and information on limits to the type of towing you can reasonably do with your vehicle.  Before towing a trailer, carefully review this information to tow your load as efficiently and safely as possible.  To maintain the New Vehicle Limited Warranty coverage, follow the requirements and recommendations in this manual concerning vehicles used for trailer towing.  TOWING A DISABLED VEHICLE This section describes procedures for towing a disabled vehicle using a commercial towing service.  If the transmission and drivetrain are operable, disabled vehicles may also be towed as described on Proper towing or lifting equipment is required to prevent damage to your vehicle.  Use only tow bars and other equipment designed for this purpose, following equipment manufacturer\u2019s instructions.  Use of safety chains is mandatory.  Attach a tow bar or other towing device to main structural members of the vehicle, not to fascia/bumpers or associated brackets.  State and local laws regarding vehicles under tow must be observed.  If you must use the accessories (wipers, defrosters, etc.)  while being towed, the ignition must be in the ON/RUN position, not the ACC position.  If the vehicle's battery is discharged, instructions on shifting the automatic transmission out of PARK (P) in order to move the vehicle CAUTION: Do not use sling type equipment when towing.  Vehicle damage may occur.  When securing the vehicle to a flatbed truck, do not attach to front or rear suspension components.  Damage to your vehicle may result from improper towing.\n\n Towing Requirements To promote proper break-in of your new vehicle drivetrain components, the following guidelines are recommended: WARNING: Improper towing can lead to a collision.  Follow these guidelines to make your trailer towing as safe as possible: Make certain that the load is secured in the trailer and that it will not shift during travel.  When trailering cargo that is not fully secured, dynamic load shifts can occur that may be difficult for the driver to control.  You could lose control of your vehicle and have a collision.  When hauling cargo, or towing a trailer, do not overload your vehicle or trailer.  Overloading can cause a loss of control, poor performance, or damage to brakes, axle, engine, transmission, steering, suspension, chassis structure, or tires.  Safety chains must always be used between your vehicle and trailer.  Always connect the chains to the frame or hook retainers of the vehicle hitch.  Cross the chains under the trailer tongue and allow enough slack for turning corners.  Vehicles with trailers should not be parked on a grade.  When parking, apply the parking brake on the tow vehicle.  Put the tow vehicle transmission in PARK.  Always block or \"chock\" the trailer wheels.  GCWR must not be exceeded.  Total weight must be distributed between the tow vehicle and the trailer such that the following four ratings are not exceeded: gvwr gtw gawr tongue weight rating for the trailer hitch utilized caution: do not tow a trailer at all during the first 500 miles (805 km) the new vehicle is driven.  The engine, axle or other parts could be damaged.  Then, during the first 500 miles (805 km) that a trailer is towed, do not drive over 50 mph (80 km/h) and do not make starts at full throttle.  This helps the engine and other parts of the vehicle wear in at the heavier loads."

In short, a ratchet lets you apply and maintain a firm, adjustable hold without the fastener loosening under load.",
      "retrieved_chunks": [
        " The Bed Rail Tie Down system allows you to properly secure cargo in the truck bed.  Bed Rail Tie Down Locations Your vehicle is equipped with the child restraint anchorage system called LATCH, which stands for Lower Anchors and Tethers for CHildren.  The LATCH system has three vehicle anchor points for installing LATCH-equipped child seats.  There are two lower anchorages located at the back of the seat cushion where it meets the seatback and one top tether anchorage located behind the seating position.  These anchorages are used to install LATCH-equipped child seats without using the vehicle\u2019s seat belts.  Some seating positions may have a top tether anchorage but no lower anchorages.  In these seating positions, the seat belt must be used with the top tether anchorage to install the child restraint.  Please see the following table for more information.  The TSC is a telescoping link that can be installed between the hitch receiver and the trailer tongue.  It typically provides adjustable friction associated with the telescoping motion to dampen any unwanted trailer swaying motions while traveling.  Supplemental Seat-Mounted Side Air Bags (SABs) are located in the outboard side of the front seats.  The SABs are marked with a \u201cSRS AIRBAG\u201d or \u201cAIRBAG\u201d on a label or on the seat trim on the outboard side of the seats.  Four auxiliary switches are located in the lower switch bank of the instrument panel and can be used to power various electrical devices.  1 \u2014 Retainers 2 \u2014 Fuel Filter Protective Cover The fold-down windshield on your vehicle is a structural element that can provide protection in some accidents.  The windshield also provides protection against weather, road debris and intrusion of small branches and other objects.\n\n Weight-Distributing Hitch A Weight-Distributing Hitch system works by applying leverage through spring (load) bars.  They are typically used for heavier loads to distribute trailer tongue weight to the tow vehicle's front axle and the trailer axle(s).  When used in accordance with the manufacturer's directions, it provides for a more level ride, offering more consistent steering and brake control thereby enhancing towing safety.  The addition of a friction/hydraulic sway control also dampens sway caused by traffic and crosswinds and contributes positively to tow vehicle and trailer stability.  Trailer sway control and a Weight-Distributing (load equalizing) Hitch are recommended for heavier Tongue Weights (TW) and may be required depending on vehicle and trailer configuration/loading to comply with Gross Axle Weight Rating (GAWR) requirements.  WARNING: An improperly adjusted Weight-Distributing Hitch system may reduce handling, stability, braking performance, and could result in a collision.  Weight-Distributing Hitch systems may not be compatible with surge brake couplers.  Consult with your hitch and trailer manufacturer or a reputable Recreational Vehicle dealer for additional information.\n\n BED RAIL TIE DOWN SYSTEM \u2014 IF EQUIPPED The Bed Rail Tie Down system allows you to properly secure cargo in the truck bed.  There are two adjustable utility rail cleats on each side of the bed that can be used to assist in securing cargo.  Each utility rail cleat must be tightened down in one of the detents along either utility rail in order to keep cargo properly secured.  To move the utility rail cleat to any position on the utility rail, turn the cleat retainer nut counterclockwise several times.  Then, pull out on the utility rail cleat and slide it to the detent nearest the desired location.  Make sure the utility rail cleat is seated in the detent, and tighten the nut.  To remove the utility rail cleats from the side utility rails, slide the cleat to the rectangular cutout located at the end of the rail toward the front of the vehicle.  To remove the utility rail cleat from the front utility rail, slide the cleat to the rectangular cutout located on the left side of the rail.  CAUTION: The maximum load per cleat should not exceed 250 lb (113 kg) and the angle of the load on each cleat should not exceed 45 degrees above horizontal, or damage to the cleat or cleat rail may occur.  Lower Anchors And Tethers For CHildren (LATCH) Your vehicle is equipped with the child restraint anchorage system called LATCH, which stands for Lower Anchors and Tethers for CHildren.

        " Under certain conditions, the mobile phone being on in your vehicle can cause erratic or noisy performance from your radio.  This condition may be lessened or eliminated by repositioning the mobile phone within the vehicle.  This condition is not harmful to the radio.  If your radio performance does not satisfactorily improve from repositioning the mobile phone, it is recommended that the volume be turned down or off during mobile phone operation when not using the Uconnect system.  Jamming due to electronic devices or driving next to facilities emitting the same radio frequencies as the TPMS sensors.  Installing some form of aftermarket window tinting that affects radio wave signals.  Lots of snow or ice around the wheels or wheel housings.  Using tire chains on the vehicle.  Using wheels/tires not equipped with TPMS sensors.  The radio unit is acting as the amplifier for audio output from the Auxiliary device.  Therefore, if the volume control on the Auxiliary device is set too low, there will be insufficient audio signal for the radio unit to play the music on the device.\n\n Once a month or before a long trip: check engine oil level check windshield washer fluid level check the tire pressures and look for unusual wear or damage check the fluid levels of the coolant reservoir, brake master cylinder, and fill as needed check function of all interior and exterior lights once a month or before a long trip: check engine oil level.  Check windshield washer fluid level Check the tire pressures and look for unusual wear or damage, rotate at the first sign of irregular wear.  Check the fluid levels of the coolant reservoir, brake master cylinder, and power steering, and fill as needed.  Check function of all interior and exterior lights What to do when an electrical load reduction action message is present (\u201cbattery saver on\u201d or \u201cbattery saver mode\u201d) during a trip: reduce power to unnecessary loads if possible: turn off redundant lights (interior or exterior) check what may be plugged in to power outlets +12 volt, 115 volts ac, usb ports check hvac settings (blower, temperature) check the audio settings (volume) after a trip: check if any aftermarket equipment was installed (additional lights, upfitter electrical accessories, audio systems, alarms) and review specifications if any (load and ignition off draw currents).  Evaluate the latest driving cycles (distance, driving time and parking time).  The vehicle should have service performed if the message is still present during consecutive trips and the evaluation of the vehicle and driving pattern did not help to identify the cause.\n\n After Driving Off-Road Off-road operation puts more stress on your vehicle than does most on-road driving.  After going off-road, it is always a good idea to check for damage.  That way you can get any problems taken care of right away and have your vehicle ready when you need it.  Completely inspect the underbody of your vehicle.  Check tires, body structure, steering, suspension, driveline, and exhaust system for damage.  Inspect the radiator for mud and debris and clean as required.  Check threaded fasteners for looseness, particularly on the chassis, drivetrain components, steering, and suspension.  Retighten them, if required, and torque to the values specified in the Service Manual.  Check for accumulations of plants or brush.  These things could be a fire hazard.  They might hide damage to fuel lines, brake hoses, axle pinion seals, and propeller shafts.  After extended operation in mud, sand, water, or similar dirty conditions, have the radiator, fan, brake rotors, wheels, brake linings, and axle yokes inspected and cleaned as soon as possible.  Note: inspect the clutch vent holes in the manual transmission bell housing for mud and debris and clean as required.  Warning: abrasive material in any part of the brakes may cause excessive wear or unpredictable braking.  You might not have full braking power when you need it to prevent a collision.  If you have been operating your vehicle in dirty conditions, get your brakes checked and cleaned as necessary.  If you experience unusual vibration after driving in mud, slush or similar conditions, check the wheels for impacted material.  Impacted material can cause a wheel imbalance and freeing the wheels of it will correct the situation."

Front and rear carpet split under the back of the front seat, open the carpet split and then pull out the rear edge and slide the carpet to the front (do not remove the harness).  Rear underside of front seat carpet split finally open the carpet split around seat bracket and then remove the last two grommets.  When reinstalling carpet, perform these steps in reverse order, making sure that the carpet is tucked under the scuffs, B-pillar, and console, and then refasten the grommets.\n\n Carpet Safety Information Always use carpet designed to fit your vehicle.  Only use carpet that does not interfere with the operation of the pedal assemblies.  Only operate the vehicle when the carpet is securely attached by the grommets so it cannot slip out of position and interfere with the pedal assemblies or impair safe operation of your vehicle in other ways.  WARNING: If operating the vehicle without carpet in place the floor may become hot, and there is a risk of burns.  An improperly attached, damaged, folded, or damaged grommets may cause your carpet to interfere with the accelerator, brake, or clutch pedals and cause a loss of vehicle control.  To prevent SERIOUS INJURY or DEATH: ALWAYS securely attach your carpet using the grommets.  ALWAYS make sure objects cannot fall or slide into the driver\u2019s side floor area when the vehicle is moving.  Objects can become trapped under accelerator, brake, or clutch pedals and could cause a loss of vehicle control.  NEVER place any objects under the carpet (e.g., towels, keys, etc.).  These objects could change the position of the carpet and may cause interference with the accelerator, brake, or clutch pedals.  ONLY install carpet designed to fit your vehicle.  NEVER install carpet that cannot be properly attached and secured to your vehicle.  If the carpet needs to be replaced, only use manufacturer approved carpet for the specific make, model, and year of your vehicle.  If the vehicle carpet has been removed and re-installed, always properly attach carpet to the floor and check that the floor mat fasteners are secure to the vehicle carpet.  Fully depress each pedal to check for interference with the accelerator, brake, or clutch pedals then re-install the floor mats."

To reset the oil change indicator system (after performing the scheduled maintenance), refer to the following procedure.  To insert an Auxiliary device, gently insert the Auxiliary device cable into the AUX port.  If you insert an Auxiliary device with the ignition and the radio on, the unit will switch to AUX Mode and begin to play.  The system will automatically time out and the ignition will cycle to the OFF position after 30 minutes of inactivity if the ignition is left in the ACC or RUN (engine not running) position and the transmission is in PARK.  For Keyless Enter \u2018n Go\u2122 equipped vehicles, the engine will turn off and the ignition will change to ACC position.  After 30 minutes the ignition switches to OFF automatically, unless the driver turns the ignition OFF.  If you must use the accessories (wipers, defrosters, etc.)  while being towed, the ignition must be in the ON/RUN position, not the ACC position.  The Power Inverter will only turn on if the ignition is in the ACC or ON/RUN position.

What type of information is sent when I use the SOS Call button from my vehicle?  Certain vehicle information, such as make and model, is transmitted along with the last known GPS location.  When could I use the SOS Call button?  You can use the SOS Call button to make a call if you or someone else needs emergency assistance.\n\n SOS Call Push the SOS Call button on the overhead console.  Note: in case the sos call button is pushed in error, there will be a 10 second delay before the sos call system initiates a call to an sos operator.  To cancel the SOS Call connection, push the SOS call button on the overhead console or press the cancellation button on the Device Screen.  Termination of the SOS Call will turn off the green LED light on the overhead console.  The LED light located within the ASSIST and SOS buttons on the overhead console will turn green once a connection to an SOS operator has been made.  Once a connection between the vehicle and an sos operator is made, the sos call system may transmit the following important vehicle information to an sos operator: indication that the occupant placed an sos call.  The vehicle brand.  The last known GPS coordinates of the vehicle.  You should be able to speak with the SOS operator through the vehicle audio system to determine if additional help is needed.  Warning: always obey traffic laws and pay attention to the road.  ALWAYS drive safely with your hands on the steering wheel.  You have full responsibility and assume all risks related to the use of the features and applications in this vehicle.  Only use the features and applications when it is safe to do so.  Failure to do so may result in an accident involving serious injury or death.  Note: your vehicle may be transmitting data as authorized by the subscriber.  Once a connection is made between the vehicle\u2019s SOS Call system and the SOS operator, the SOS operator may be able to open a voice connection with the vehicle to determine if additional help is needed.  Once the SOS operator opens a voice connection with the vehicle\u2019s SOS Call system, the operator should be able to speak with the vehicle occupants, and hear sounds occurring in the vehicle.  The vehicle\u2019s SOS Call system will attempt to remain connected with the SOS operator until the SOS operator terminates the connection.  The SOS operator may attempt to contact appropriate emergency responders and provide them with important vehicle information and GPS coordinates.  WARNING: If anyone in the vehicle could be in danger (e.g., fire or smoke is visible, dangerous road conditions or location), do not wait for voice contact from an Emergency Services Agent.  All occupants should exit the vehicle immediately and move to a safe location.  Never place anything on or near the vehicle\u2019s operable network and GPS antennas.  You could prevent operable network and GPS signal reception, which can prevent your vehicle from placing an emergency call.  An operable network and GPS signal reception is required for the SOS Call system to function properly.  The SOS Call system is embedded into the vehicle\u2019s electrical system.  Do not add aftermarket electrical equipment to the vehicle\u2019s electrical system.  This may prevent your vehicle from sending a signal to initiate an emergency call.  To avoid interference that can cause the SOS Call system to fail, never add aftermarket equipment (e.g., two-way mobile radio, CB radio, data recorder, etc.)  to your vehicle\u2019s electrical system or modify the antennas on your vehicle.  IF YOUR VEHICLE LOSES BATTERY POWER FOR ANY REASON (INCLUDING DURING OR AFTER AN ACCIDENT), THE UCONNECT FEATURES, APPS AND SERVICES, AMONG OTHERS, WILL NOT OPERATE.

If using a manual transmission vehicle for trailer towing, all starts must be in first gear to avoid excessive clutch slippage.  TRAILER TOWING In this section you will find safety tips and information on limits to the type of towing you can reasonably do with your vehicle.  Before towing a trailer, carefully review this information to tow your load as efficiently and safely as possible.  To maintain the New Vehicle Limited Warranty coverage, follow the requirements and recommendations in this manual concerning vehicles used for trailer towing.  TOWING A DISABLED VEHICLE This section describes procedures for towing a disabled vehicle using a commercial towing service.  If the transmission and drivetrain are operable, disabled vehicles may also be towed as described on Proper towing or lifting equipment is required to prevent damage to your vehicle.  Use only tow bars and other equipment designed for this purpose, following equipment manufacturer\u2019s instructions.  Use of safety chains is mandatory.  Attach a tow bar or other towing device to main structural members of the vehicle, not to fascia/bumpers or associated brackets.  State and local laws regarding vehicles under tow must be observed.  If you must use the accessories (wipers, defrosters, etc.)  while being towed, the ignition must be in the ON/RUN position, not the ACC position.  If the vehicle's battery is discharged, instructions on shifting the automatic transmission out of PARK (P) in order to move the vehicle CAUTION: Do not use sling type equipment when towing.  Vehicle damage may occur.  When securing the vehicle to a flatbed truck, do not attach to front or rear suspension components.  Damage to your vehicle may result from improper towing.\n\n Towing Requirements To promote proper break-in of your new vehicle drivetrain components, the following guidelines are recommended: WARNING: Improper towing can lead to a collision.  Follow these guidelines to make your trailer towing as safe as possible: Make certain that the load is secured in the trailer and that it will not shift during travel.  When trailering cargo that is not fully secured, dynamic load shifts can occur that may be difficult for the driver to control.  You could lose control of your vehicle and have a collision.  When hauling cargo, or towing a trailer, do not overload your vehicle or trailer.  Overloading can cause a loss of control, poor performance, or damage to brakes, axle, engine, transmission, steering, suspension, chassis structure, or tires.  Safety chains must always be used between your vehicle and trailer.  Always connect the chains to the frame or hook retainers of the vehicle hitch.  Cross the chains under the trailer tongue and allow enough slack for turning corners.  Vehicles with trailers should not be parked on a grade.  When parking, apply the parking brake on the tow vehicle.  Put the tow vehicle transmission in PARK.  Always block or \"chock\" the trailer wheels.  GCWR must not be exceeded.  Total weight must be distributed between the tow vehicle and the trailer such that the following four ratings are not exceeded: gvwr gtw gawr tongue weight rating for the trailer hitch utilized caution: do not tow a trailer at all during the first 500 miles (805 km) the new vehicle is driven.  The engine, axle or other parts could be damaged.  Then, during the first 500 miles (805 km) that a trailer is towed, do not drive over 50 mph (80 km/h) and do not make starts at full throttle.  This helps the engine and other parts of the vehicle wear in at the heavier loads."

The head restraints are folded independently Position the latch plate as close as possible to the anchor point.  At about 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 cm) above the latch plate, grab and twist the seat belt webbing 180 degrees to create a fold that begins immediately above the latch plate.  Slide the latch plate upward over the folded webbing.  The folded webbing must enter the slot at the top of the latch plate.  Continue to slide the latch plate up until it clears the folded webbing and the seat belt is no longer twisted.  Be sure that the front seats are fully upright and positioned forward.  This will allow the rear seat to fold down easily.  The center head restraints must be in the lowest position to avoid contact with the center console when folding the seat.

If the temperature is 41\u00b0F (5\u00b0C) or below, do not attempt to put the top down or roll the rear or side curtains.  WARNING: Do not drive the vehicle with the rear window up/removed unless the quarter windows are also removed.  Dangerous exhaust gases could enter the vehicle causing harm to the driver and passengers.  The fabric quarter windows and fabric top are designed only for protection against the elements.  Do not rely on them to contain occupants within the vehicle or to protect against injury during an accident.  Remember, always wear seat belts.  Make sure hands and fingers are clear of all pinch points when installing and removing the soft top.  The lift assist mechanism and side bows may cause serious injury if fingers or hands get caught in between.  CAUTION: The soft top is not designed to carry any additional loads such as roof racks, spare tires, building, hunting or camping supplies, and/or luggage, etc.  Also, it was not designed as a structural member of the vehicle and, thus, cannot properly carry any additional loads other than environmental (rain, snow, etc.).  CAUTION: Do not run a fabric top through an automatic car wash.  Window scratches and wax buildup may result.  Do not lower the top when the temperature is below 41\u00b0F (5\u00b0C).  Damage to the top may result.  Do not move your vehicle until the top has been either fully attached to the windshield frame, or fully lowered.  Follow the proper steps for cleaning and caring for your vehicle\u2019s fabric top Do not use any tools (screwdrivers, etc.)  to pry or force any of the clamps, clips, or retainers securing the soft top.  Do not force or pry the soft top framework when opening or closing.  Damage to the top may result.  Failure to follow these cautions may cause interior water damage, stains, or mildew on the top material: It is recommended that the top be free of water prior to opening it.  Operating the top, opening a door or lowering a window while the top is wet may allow water to drip into the vehicle's interior.  Careless handling and storage of the soft top may damage the seals, causing water to leak into the vehicle's interior.  The soft top must be positioned properly to ensure sealing.  Improper installation can cause water to leak into the vehicle's interior."

        " Your vehicle is equipped with a sophisticated Onboard Diagnostic system called OBD II.  This system monitors the performance of the emissions, engine, and transmission control systems.  When these systems are operating properly, your vehicle will provide excellent performance and fuel economy, as well as engine emissions well within current government regulations.  Cycle the ignition switch to the ON position, but do not crank or start the engine.  If you crank or start the engine, you will have to start this test over.  As soon as you cycle the ignition switch to the ON position, you will see the Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) symbol come on as part of a normal bulb check.  Approximately 15 seconds later, one of two things will happen: The MIL will flash for about 10 seconds and then return to being fully illuminated until you turn OFF the ignition or start the engine.  This means that your vehicle's obd ii system is not ready and you should not proceed to the i/m station.  The MIL will not flash at all and will remain fully illuminated until you place the ignition in the off position or start the engine.  This means that your vehicle's obd ii system is ready and you can proceed to the i/m station.  In some localities, it may be a legal requirement to pass an inspection of your vehicle's emissions control system.  Failure to pass could prevent vehicle registration.\n\n EMISSIONS INSPECTION AND MAINTENANCE PROGRAMS In some localities, it may be a legal requirement to pass an inspection of your vehicle's emissions control system.  Failure to pass could prevent vehicle registration.  For states and/or provinces that require an Inspection and Maintenance (I/M), this check verifies the Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL) is functioning and is not on when the engine is running, and that the OBD II system is ready for testing.  The obd ii system may not be ready if your vehicle was recently serviced, recently had a depleted battery or a battery replacement.  If the OBD II system should be determined not ready for the I/M test, your vehicle may fail the test.  Your vehicle has a simple ignition actuated test, which you can use prior to going to the test station.  To check if your vehicle's OBD II system is ready, you must do the following: Cycle the ignition switch to the ON position, but do not crank or start the engine.

This means that your vehicle's obd ii system is ready and you can proceed to the i/m station.  If your obd ii system is not ready, you should see an authorized dealer or repair facility.  If your vehicle was recently serviced or had a battery failure or replacement, you may need to do nothing more than drive your vehicle as you normally would in order for your OBD II system to update.  A recheck with the previously mentioned test routine may then indicate that the system is now ready.  Regardless of whether your vehicle's OBD II system is ready, if the MIL is illuminated during normal vehicle operation you should have your vehicle serviced before going to the I/M station.  The I/M station can fail your vehicle because the MIL is on with the engine running.  Keyless Enter \u2018n Go\u2122 Ignition This feature allows the driver to operate the ignition switch with the push of a START/STOP ignition button as long as the key fob is in the passenger compartment.  The START/STOP ignition button has several operating modes that are labeled and will illuminate when in position.  These modes are OFF, ACC, RUN, and START.  The push button ignition can be placed in the following modes: Enhanced Accident Response System Reset Procedure In order to reset the Enhanced Accident Response System functions after an event, the ignition switch must be changed from ignition START or ON/RUN to ignition OFF.  Carefully check the vehicle for fuel leaks in the engine compartment and on the ground near the engine compartment and fuel tank before resetting the system and starting the engine.  After an accident, if the vehicle will not start after performing the reset procedure, the vehicle must be towed to an authorized dealer to be inspected and to have the Enhanced Accident Response System reset.\n\n Your vehicle has a simple ignition actuated test, which you can use prior to going to the test station.

It could also affect fuel economy and driveability.  The vehicle must be serviced before any emissions tests can be performed.  If the MIL is flashing while the vehicle is running, severe catalytic converter damage and power loss will soon occur.  Immediate service is required."

Please refer to your provided radio supplement for complete information.\n\n SOS Call Push the SOS Call button on the overhead console.  Note: in case the sos call button is pushed in error, there will be a 10 second delay before the sos call system initiates a call to an sos operator.  To cancel the SOS Call connection, push the SOS call button on the overhead console or press the cancellation button on the Device Screen.  Termination of the SOS Call will turn off the green LED light on the overhead console.  The LED light located within the ASSIST and SOS buttons on the overhead console will turn green once a connection to an SOS operator has been made.  Once a connection between the vehicle and an sos operator is made, the sos call system may transmit the following important vehicle information to an sos operator: indication that the occupant placed an sos call.  The vehicle brand.  The last known GPS coordinates of the vehicle.  You should be able to speak with the SOS operator through the vehicle audio system to determine if additional help is needed.  Warning: always obey traffic laws and pay attention to the road.  ALWAYS drive safely with your hands on the steering wheel.  You have full responsibility and assume all risks related to the use of the features and applications in this vehicle.  Only use the features and applications when it is safe to do so.  Failure to do so may result in an accident involving serious injury or death.  Note: your vehicle may be transmitting data as authorized by the subscriber.  Once a connection is made between the vehicle\u2019s SOS Call system and the SOS operator, the SOS operator may be able to open a voice connection with the vehicle to determine if additional help is needed.  Once the SOS operator opens a voice connection with the vehicle\u2019s SOS Call system, the operator should be able to speak with the vehicle occupants, and hear sounds occurring in the vehicle.  The vehicle\u2019s SOS Call system will attempt to remain connected with the SOS operator until the SOS operator terminates the connection.  The SOS operator may attempt to contact appropriate emergency responders and provide them with important vehicle information and GPS coordinates.  WARNING: If anyone in the vehicle could be in danger (e.g., fire or smoke is visible, dangerous road conditions or location), do not wait for voice contact from an Emergency Services Agent.  All occupants should exit the vehicle immediately and move to a safe location.  Never place anything on or near the vehicle\u2019s operable network and GPS antennas.  You could prevent operable network and GPS signal reception, which can prevent your vehicle from placing an emergency call.  An operable network and GPS signal reception is required for the SOS Call system to function properly.  The SOS Call system is embedded into the vehicle\u2019s electrical system.  Do not add aftermarket electrical equipment to the vehicle\u2019s electrical system.  This may prevent your vehicle from sending a signal to initiate an emergency call.  To avoid interference that can cause the SOS Call system to fail, never add aftermarket equipment (e.g., two-way mobile radio, CB radio, data recorder, etc.)  to your vehicle\u2019s electrical system or modify the antennas on your vehicle.  IF YOUR VEHICLE LOSES BATTERY POWER FOR ANY REASON (INCLUDING DURING OR AFTER AN ACCIDENT), THE UCONNECT FEATURES, APPS AND SERVICES, AMONG OTHERS, WILL NOT OPERATE.

      "ground_truth_answer": "To keep the air inside fresh, make sure the air intake located in front of the windshield is free of obstructions like leaves. Additionally, in winter months, ensure the air intake is clear of ice, slush, and snow. Using the ventilation system properly during humid weather can also help prevent fogging, which can impact air quality.",
      "generated_response": "Here are a few practical steps\u2014drawn from the vehicle\u2011climate\u2011control guidelines\u2014to keep the cabin air clean and fresh:\n\n1. **Keep the outside\u2011air intake clear**  \n   * The intake is right in front of the windshield. Make sure it isn\u2019t blocked by leaves, snow, ice or slush. A clean intake lets fresh outside air flow into the HVAC system and prevents debris from clogging the water\u2011drain passages.\n\n2. **Use the \u201cfresh\u2011air\u201d (outside) mode whenever possible**  \n   * Select the **Defrost** or **Mix** mode and let the system draw air from the outside rather than recirculating interior air. This brings in fresh air and helps flush out any odors or pollutants that may have built up inside the cabin.\n\n3. **Avoid long periods of pure recirculation without A/C**  \n   * Running the system in Recirculation mode without the air\u2011conditioner can cause humidity to rise and the windows to fog, which is a sign that the interior air is getting stale. If you need to recirculate for a short time (e.g., in heavy traffic), keep the A/C compressor on so the system continues to de\u2011humidify and filter the air.\n\n4. **Turn the A/C on for de\u2011humidification**  \n   * Even if you don\u2019t need cooling, the A/C\u2019s compressor removes moisture from the incoming air, which reduces fogging and helps keep the cabin air dry and less prone to mold or mildew growth.\n\n5. **Maintain the cabin\u2011air filter**  \n   * Although not mentioned explicitly in the excerpt, most vehicles have a cabin\u2011air (pollution) filter located behind the glove box. Replace it according to the manufacturer\u2019s schedule, or sooner if you notice reduced airflow or a musty smell.\n\n6. **Keep the HVAC condenser clean**  \n   * A dirty condenser (the radiator\u2011mounted unit in front of the main radiator) can reduce overall",

        " Outside Air Intake Make sure the air intake, located directly in front of the windshield, is free of obstructions, such as leaves.  Leaves collected in the air intake may reduce airflow, and if they enter the air distribution box, they could plug the water drains.  In Winter months, make sure the air intake is clear of ice, slush, and snow.\n\n Window Fogging Vehicle windows tend to fog on the inside in mild, rainy, and/or humid weather.  To clear the windows, select Defrost or Mix mode and increase the front blower speed.  Do not use the Recirculation mode without A/C for long periods, as fogging may occur.\n\n On the highways \u2014 slow down.  In city traffic \u2014 while stopped, place the transmission in NEUTRAL (N), but do not increase the engine idle speed while preventing vehicle motion with the brakes.  If your Air Conditioner (A/C) is on, turn it off.  The A/C system adds heat to the engine cooling system and turning the A/C off can help remove this heat.  You can also turn the temperature control to maximum heat, the mode control to floor and the blower control to high.  This allows the heater core to act as a supplement to the radiator and aids in removing heat from the engine cooling system.  For Manual Climate Controls, if the system is in Mix, Floor or Defrost Mode, the A/C can be turned off, but the A/C system shall remain active to prevent fogging of the windows.  If fog or mist appears on the windshield or side glass, select Defrost mode, and increase blower speed if needed.  If your air conditioning performance seems lower than expected, check the front of the A/C condenser (located in front of the radiator), for an accumulation of dirt or insects.  Clean with a gentle water spray from the front of the radiator and through the condenser.  In unusual situations involving grossly malfunctioning engine operation, a scorching odor may suggest severe and abnormal catalyst overheating.  If this occurs, stop the vehicle, turn off the engine and allow it to cool.  Service, including a tune-up to manufacturer's specifications, should be obtained immediately."

      "retrieved_chunks": [
        " For the recommended viscosity and quality grades seeThe Treadwear grade is a comparative rating, based on the wear rate of the tire when tested under controlled conditions on a specified government test course.  For example, a tire graded 150 would wear one and one-half times as well on the government course as a tire graded 100.  The relative performance of tires depends upon the actual conditions of their use, however, and may depart significantly from the norm due to variations in driving habits, service practices, and differences in road characteristics and climate.  The following tire grading categories were established by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.  The specific grade rating assigned by the tire's manufacturer in each category is shown on the sidewall of the tires on your vehicle.  The Traction grades, from highest to lowest, are AA, A, B, and C. These grades represent the tire's ability to stop on wet pavement, as measured under controlled conditions on specified government test surfaces of asphalt and concrete.  A tire marked C may have poor traction performance.  Sustained high temperature can cause the material of the tire to degenerate and reduce tire life, and excessive temperature can lead to sudden tire failure.  The grade C corresponds to a level of performance, which all passenger vehicle tires must meet under the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 109. Grades B and A represent higher levels of performance on the laboratory test wheel, than the minimum required by law.  The Temperature grades are A (the highest), B, and C, representing the tire's resistance to the generation of heat and its ability to dissipate heat, when tested under controlled conditions on a specified indoor laboratory test wheel.  The traction grade assigned to this tire is based on straight-ahead braking traction tests, and does not include acceleration, cornering, hydroplaning, or peak traction characteristics.  All passenger vehicle tires must conform to Federal safety requirements in addition to these grades.  For devices which are not made a favorite, the device priority is determined by the order in which it was paired.  The most recent device paired will have the higher priority.\n\n Temperature Grades The Temperature grades are A (the highest), B, and C, representing the tire's resistance to the generation of heat and its ability to dissipate heat, when tested under controlled conditions on a specified indoor laboratory test wheel.

Evaluate the latest driving cycles (distance, driving time and parking time).  The vehicle should have service performed if the message is still present during consecutive trips and the evaluation of the vehicle and driving pattern did not help to identify the cause.\n\n Never use the PARK position as a substitute for the parking brake.  Always apply the parking brake fully when exiting the vehicle to guard against vehicle movement and possible injury or damage.  Your vehicle could move and injure you and others if it is not in PARK.  Check by trying to move the transmission gear selector out of PARK with the brake pedal released.  Make sure the transmission is in PARK before exiting the vehicle.  The transmission may not engage PARK if the vehicle is moving.  Always bring the vehicle to a complete stop before shifting to PARK, and verify that the transmission gear position indicator solidly indicates PARK (P) without blinking.  Ensure that the vehicle is completely stopped, and the PARK position is properly indicated, before exiting the vehicle.  It is dangerous to shift out of PARK or NEUTRAL if the engine speed is higher than idle speed.  If your foot is not firmly pressing the brake pedal, the vehicle could accelerate quickly forward or in reverse.  You could lose control of the vehicle and hit someone or something.  Only shift into gear when the engine is idling normally and your foot is firmly pressing the brake pedal.  Unintended movement of a vehicle could injure those in or near the vehicle.  As with all vehicles, you should never exit a vehicle while the engine is running.  Before exiting a vehicle, always come to a complete stop, then apply the parking brake, shift the transmission into PARK, and turn the ignition OFF.  When the ignition is in the OFF position, the transmission is locked in PARK, securing the vehicle against unwanted movement.  When exiting the vehicle, always make sure the ignition is in the OFF position, remove the key fob from the vehicle, and lock the vehicle.  Never leave children alone in a vehicle, or with access to an unlocked vehicle.  Allowing children to be in a vehicle unattended is dangerous for a number of reasons.  A child or others could be seriously or fatally injured.  Children should be warned not to touch the parking brake, brake pedal or the transmission gear selector.  Do not leave the key fob in or near the vehicle (or in a location accessible to children), and do not leave the ignition in the ACC or ON/RUN position.  A child could operate power windows, other controls, or move the vehicle.  Always do a visual check that your vehicle is in park by looking for the \u201cp\u201d in the instrument cluster display and on the gear selector.  As an added precaution, always apply the parking brake when exiting the vehicle.  Check engine oil level.  Check windshield washer fluid level.

Charge Air Cooler \u2014 Inter-Cooler (Diesel Engine) The charge air cooler is positioned in front of the radiator and the air conditioner condenser.  Air enters the engine through the air cleaner and passes through the turbocharger, where it is pressurized.  This pressurized air rapidly reaches high temperature.  The air is then directed through a hose to the charge air cooler and through another hose to the intake manifold of the engine.  This cooling process enables more efficient burning of fuel resulting in fewer emissions.  To guarantee optimum performance of the system, keep the surfaces of the charge air cooler, condenser and radiator clean and free of debris.  Periodically check the hoses leading to and from the charge air cooler for cracks or loose clamps resulting in loss of pressure and reduced engine performance."

Retighten them, if required, and torque to the values specified in the Service Manual.  Check for accumulations of plants or brush.  These things could be a fire hazard.  They might hide damage to fuel lines, brake hoses, axle pinion seals, and propeller shafts.  After extended operation in mud, sand, water, or similar dirty conditions, have the radiator, fan, brake rotors, wheels, brake linings, and axle yokes inspected and cleaned as soon as possible.  Inspect the clutch vent holes in the manual transmission bell housing for mud and debris and clean as required.  Abrasive material in any part of the brakes may cause excessive wear or unpredictable braking.  You might not have full braking power when you need it to prevent a collision.  If you have been operating your vehicle in dirty conditions, get your brakes checked and cleaned as necessary.  If you experience unusual vibration after driving in mud, slush or similar conditions, check the wheels for impacted material.  Impacted material can cause a wheel imbalance and freeing the wheels of it will correct the situation."

Potential signs of vehicle overheating: temperature gauge is at hot (h) strong smell of coolant white smoke coming from engine or exhaust coolant bottle coolant has bubbles present in the event it is observed that the temperature gauge is moving towards or close to the hot (h) position, you can reduce the potential for overheating by taking the appropriate action.  On the highways \u2014 slow down.  In city traffic \u2014 while stopped, place the transmission in NEUTRAL (N), but do not increase the engine idle speed while preventing vehicle motion with the brakes.  If your Air Conditioner (A/C) is on, turn it off.  The A/C system adds heat to the engine cooling system and turning the A/C off can help remove this heat.  You can also turn the temperature control to maximum heat, the mode control to floor and the blower control to high.  This allows the heater core to act as a supplement to the radiator and aids in removing heat from the engine cooling system.  WARNING: You or others can be badly burned by hot engine coolant (antifreeze) or steam from your radiator.  If you see or hear steam coming from under the hood, do not open the hood until the radiator has had time to cool.  Never try to open a cooling system pressure cap when the radiator or coolant bottle is hot.  CAUTION: Driving with a hot cooling system could damage your vehicle.

Frequency Operated Button Integrated Key (FOBIK-Safe) To minimize the possibility of unintentionally locking a Passive Entry key fob inside your vehicle, the Passive Entry system is equipped with an automatic door unlock feature which will function only if the ignition switch is in the OFF position.  FOBIK-Safe only executes in vehicles with Passive Entry.  There are three situations that trigger a FOBIK-Safe search in any Passive Entry vehicle: A lock request is made by a valid Passive Entry key fob while a door is open.  A lock request is made by the Passive Entry door handle while a door is open.  A lock request is made by the door panel switch while the door is open.  When any of these situations occur, after all open doors are closed, the FOBIK-Safe search will be executed.  If it detects a Passive Entry key fob inside the vehicle, the vehicle will unlock and alert the customer.  If Passive Entry is disabled using the Uconnect system, the key fob protection described in this section remains active/functional.  Note: The vehicle will only unlock the doors during a FOBIK-Safe operation when a valid Passive Entry key fob is detected inside the vehicle.  The vehicle will not unlock the doors when any of the following conditions are true: A second valid Passive Entry key fob is detected outside of the vehicle (within 5 ft (1.5 m) of a Passive Entry door handle).  The doors are manually locked using the door lock knobs.  Three attempts are made to lock the doors using the door panel switch, and then the doors are closed.  To Lock The Vehicle\u2019s Doors With one of the vehicle\u2019s Passive Entry key fobs within 5 ft (1.5 m) of the driver or passenger front door handles, pushing the Passive Entry lock button will lock the vehicle doors.  Note: When pushing the door handle lock button, DO NOT grab the door handle.  This could unlock the door(s).  Note: After pushing the door handle button, the driver must wait three seconds before locking or unlocking the doors, using any Passive Entry door handle.  This is done to allow the driver to check if the vehicle is locked by pulling the door handle without the vehicle unlocking.  If Passive Entry is disabled using the Uconnect system, the key fob protection described in \u201cPreventing Inadvertent Locking Of Passive Entry Key Fob In Vehicle\u201d remains active/functional.

        " Off-Road Driving Tips\n\n The Basics Of Off-Road Driving You will encounter many types of terrain driving off-road.  You should be familiar with the terrain and area before proceeding.  There are many types of surface conditions: hard-packed dirt, gravel, rocks, grass, sand, mud, snow and ice.  Every surface has a different effect on your vehicle's steering, handling and traction.  Controlling your vehicle is one of the keys to successful off-road driving, so always keep a firm grip on the steering wheel and maintain a good driving posture.  Avoid sudden accelerations, turns or braking.  In most cases, there are no road signs, posted speed limits or signal lights.  Therefore, you will need to use your own good judgment on what is safe and what is not.  When on a trail, you should always be looking ahead for surface obstacles and changes in terrain.  The key is to plan your future driving route while remembering what you are currently driving over.  Note: It is recommended that the Stop/Start system be disabled during off-road use.  WARNING: Always wear your seat belt and firmly tie down cargo.  Unsecured cargo can become projectiles in an off-road situation.  CAUTION: Never park your vehicle over dry grass or other combustible materials.  The heat from your vehicle exhaust system could cause a fire.\n\n If you get hung up or high-centered on an object, get out of the vehicle and try to determine what the vehicle is hung up on, where it is contacting the underbody and what is the best direction to recover the vehicle.  Depending on what you are in contact with, jack the vehicle up and place a few rocks under the tires so the weight is off of the high point when you let the vehicle down.  You can also try rocking the vehicle or winching the vehicle off the object.  You will encounter many types of terrain driving off-road.  You should be familiar with the terrain and area before proceeding.  There are many types of surface conditions: hard-packed dirt, gravel, rocks, grass, sand, mud, snow and ice.

Therefore, you will need to use your own good judgment on what is safe and what is not.  When on a trail, you should always be looking ahead for surface obstacles and changes in terrain.  The key is to plan your future driving route while remembering what you are currently driving over.  As you approach a hill, consider its grade or steepness.  Determine if it is too steep.  Look to see what the traction is on the hill side trail.  Is the trail straight up and down?  What is on top and the other side?  Are there ruts, rocks, branches or other obstacles on the path?  Can you safely recover the vehicle if something goes wrong?  If everything looks good and you feel confident, shift the transmission into a lower gear with 4L engaged, and proceed with caution, maintaining your momentum as you climb the hill.  When approaching large rocks, choose a path which ensures you drive over the largest of them with your tires.  This will lift your undercarriage over the obstacle.  The tread of the tire is tougher and thicker than the side wall and is designed to take the abuse.  Always look ahead and make every effort to cross the large rocks with your tires."
