          "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking for the value of rent expense and certain office equipment expense under lease agreements between 2013 and 2015. The context provided mentions the rent expenses for those years.\n\nLooking at the context, it says: \"rent expense and certain office equipment expense under lease agreements amounted to $136 million, $132 million and $137 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\"\n\nWait, the order here is 2015, 2014, 2013. Let me parse that correctly. The numbers are listed as 136, 132, 137 for 2015, 2014, 2013. So 2013 is $137 million, 2014 is $132 million, and 2015 is $136 million. The question is asking for the total between 2013 and 2015. So I need to add those three numbers together.\n\nLet me check again. The sentence says: \"in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\" But the numbers are given as [\"2015\", \"$136 million\"], [\"2014\", \"$132 million\"], [\"2013\", \"$137 million\"]. Wait, the order in the sentence is 2015, 2014, 2013, but the numbers are 136, 132, 137. So 2013 is the last one mentioned but has the highest value here. So adding them up: 137 (2013) + 132 (2014) + 136 (2015). Let me calculate that.\n\n137 + 132 is 269, plus 136 is 405. So the total would be $405 million. The answer should be 405 million dollars.

The context provided has a table with the future minimum lease payments for non-cancelable operating leases as of May 31, 2013.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which of the listed fiscal years fall within the next 12 months from May 31, 2013. The next 12 months would be from May 31, 2013, to May 31, 2014. So any payments due in the fiscal year ending May 31, 2014, would be within that 12-month period.\n\nLooking at the data, the first entry is for 2014 with $11,057. The next one is 2015, which is after that. So the next 12 months would include the 2014 fiscal year's payments. Therefore, the amount due in the next 12 months is $11,057. The total future minimum lease payments are $57,096. \n\nWait, but the question is asking for the portion, which could be the amount itself or the percentage. The answer might just be the amount for 2014 since that's the next fiscal year. Let me check the question again. It says \"what portion... are due in the next 12 months?\" So the answer is the amount listed under 2014, which is $11,057. The other years are beyond the next 12 months. The \"thereafter\" category is after 2018, so definitely not in the next 12 months. So the correct answer should be $11,057.\n</think>\n\nThe portion of future minimum lease payments due in the next 12 months corresponds to the fiscal year ending May 31, 2014, which is **$11,057**.

The first row is in millions of dollars, but the actual data starts with \"interest rate risks (1)\" and so on.\n\nLooking at the \"interest rate risks (1)\" row, the numbers are $5186 for 2018, $5301 for 2017, and $4229 for 2016. Wait, the question is about 2016 to 2017. So the values are 2016: $4229 million and 2017: $5301 million.\n\nTo calculate the percent change, the formula is ((New Value - Old Value)/Old Value) * 100. So here, New Value is 2017's value, which is 5301, and Old Value is 2016's value, 4229. \n\nLet me do the subtraction first: 5301 - 4229 = 1072. Then divide that by 4229. So 1072 / 4229. Let me calculate that. Let me see, 4229 times 0.25 is 1057.25. That's close to 1072. So maybe approximately 0.253 or something. Let me do exact division: 1072 divided by 4229. Let me use a calculator approach here. \n\nDividing 1072 by 4229: \n\nWell, 4229 * 0.25 = 1057.25. The difference between 1072 and 1057.25 is 14.75. So 14.75 / 4229 \u2248 0.00349.

But for percentage change, the actual units don't matter as long as both numbers are in the same units, which they are here.\n\nThe formula for percentage change is [(New Value - Old Value) / Old Value] * 100. Here, the old value is 2011's collateral posted, which is 29,002 million, and the new value is 2012's 24,296 million. Wait, but 2012 is later than 2011, so the old value is 2011 and new is 2012. So plugging in the numbers: (24296 - 29002) / 29002 * 100. Let me calculate that.\n\nFirst, subtract: 24,296 minus 29,002 equals -4,706. Then divide by 29,002: -4,706 / 29,002 \u2248 -0.1623. Multiply by 100 gives approximately -16.23%. So the percentage change is a decrease of about 16.23%. \n\nWait, but the user might want the absolute value, but percentage change can be negative. Since the collateral posted decreased from 2011 to 2012, the percentage change is negative. The answer should be -16.23%, but maybe they want it as a positive number with a note that it's a decrease. However, standard percentage change includes the sign. Let me double-check the numbers. The 2011 value is 29,002 and 2012 is 24,296. Yes",

The numbers in the table are straightforward, so the calculation should be correct. Rounding to two decimal places, the answer is about 3.09%.

          "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the information provided in the context, the portion of the total net reserves that is related to the London market is $57 million.\n\nThe summary of environmental reserves shows that the \"London market\" category has gross reserves of $57 million.",
          "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking what portion of the total net reserves is related to the London Market. Let me look at the context provided.\n\nFirst, there's a table with different categories. The first row has \"total reserves\", but then there's a breakdown under \"gross\" into direct, assumed reinsurance, London market, and total. The numbers are in dollars. Direct is $271, assumed reinsurance is $39, London market is $57, and total gross is $367. Then there's ceded at -47 (which I think is subtracted), leading to net of $320.\n\nSo the total net reserves are $320. The question is about the portion related to London Market. From the gross breakdown, London Market is $57. But wait, does the ceded amount affect the London Market specifically? The ceded is -47, which is subtracted from the total gross to get the net. But the ceded might be a separate figure. Let me check the structure again.\n\nThe table shows:\n\nGross:\n- Direct: 271\n- Assumed reinsurance: 39\n- London market: 57\nTotal gross: 367\n\nCeded: -47\n\nNet: 320\n\nSo the net is total gross minus ceded. But the ceded amount is a total, not broken down by categories. So if the London Market is part of the gross, and then ceded is subtracted overall, then the net for London Market would be its gross amount (57) minus any portion of the ceded that relates to it. However, the problem doesn't provide a breakdown of ceded by category. The ceded is a total of -47. \n\nBut the question is asking for the portion of the total net reserves related to London Market. Since the ceded is a total, perhaps the London Market's net is just its gross amount (57) minus some portion of the ceded. However, without specific info on how ceded is split between direct, assumed, and London, we can't adjust the London Market specifically. Therefore, maybe the answer is based on the gross London Market divided by total gross, but adjusted by the net. Wait, no. The total net is 320. The question is about the portion of the net",

The context is about American Airlines Group (AAG) and their bankruptcy settlement obligations as of December 31, 2013. The question is asking specifically about the portion related to labor deemed claims.\n\nLooking through the context, there's a mention of \"claims and other bankruptcy settlement obligations\" on the consolidated balance sheet. The first paragraph talks about employees' contributions to the reorganization, and how AAG and American agreed to provide each employee group a deemed claim. This deemed claim was for a portion of the equity in the reorganized entity. \n\nThen, there's information about the initial distribution: $595 million in common stock and $300 million in cash for payroll taxes.

The question is about the portion related to labor deemed claims. \n\nBut the total bankruptcy settlement obligations would include all the components. However, the context doesn't explicitly state the total amount of all obligations, only the components related to labor. Let me check again.\n\nThe context says that the remaining liability to labor groups is $849 million, and the fair value of the equity contract obligations (which are part of the total obligations) is $1.7 billion. But the question is about the portion related to labor. \n\nWait, the $849 million is the remaining liability for labor groups as of 2013. However, the initial distribution was $595 million in stock and $300 million in cash. So total distributed initially would be 595 + 300 = $895 million. Then the remaining is $849 million.

The question is asking about the variation between the expenses for environmental remediation and the reserves for environmental matters in the year 2014. \n\nFirst, I need to find the numbers related to 2014 from the context provided. The context mentions that the expenses for environmental remediation in 2014 were $2.9 million. Then, the reserves as of December 31, 2014, were $8.8 million. \n\nWait, the question is about the variation between these two numbers. So, variation here probably means the difference. So, I need to subtract the 2014 expenses from the 2014 reserves. Let me check the numbers again to make sure.\n\nExpenses in 2014: $2.9 million. Reserves at the end of 2014: $8.8 million. So the variation would be 8.8 minus 2.9. Let me calculate that. 8.8 minus 2.9 equals 5.9. So the variation is $5.9 million. \n\nBut wait, I need to make sure I'm not mixing up the years. The reserves as of December 31, 2014, include all the expenses up to that point, right? The expenses for 2014 are part of what contributed to the reserves. But the reserves themselves are the total recorded at that date. The question is specifically about the difference between the expenses incurred in 2014 and the reserves recorded at the end of 2014. So yes, subtracting the expense from the reserve gives the variation. \n\nI think that's correct. Let me just confirm there's no other information that might affect this.

The context provided has some financial data, so I need to parse that.\n\nFirst, I remember that growth rate is calculated as ((Current Year Value - Previous Year Value) / Previous Year Value) * 100. So I need the net revenue for 2014 and 2015. \n\nLooking at the table provided, there are entries for \"2014 net revenue\" and \"2015 net revenue\". The numbers are $5735 million for 2014 and $5829 million for 2015. \n\nLet me double-check that. The table has [\"2014 net revenue\", \"$ 5735\"] and [\"2015 net revenue\", \"$ 5829\"]. Yes, that's correct. \n\nSo the calculation would be ((5829 - 5735) / 5735) * 100. Let me compute that. \n\nSubtracting first: 5829 - 5735 = 94. Then divide by 5735: 94 / 5735 \u2248 0.0164.

The question is asking what percentage of the outstanding options were from plans approved by security holders. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the context provided. There's a table with different plan categories. The first row is \"equity compensation plans approved by security holders\" and the second is \"equity compensation plans not approved by security holders\". The total is also given.\n\nThe columns are (a) number of securities to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options, (b) weighted-average exercise price, and (c) remaining available for future issuance. \n\nSo, the key numbers here are the \"number of securities to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options\" for both approved and not approved plans. The question is about the percentage of outstanding options from approved plans. \n\nLooking at the numbers: for approved plans, column (a) is 1,211,143. For not approved, it's 5,978. The total is 1,217,121. Wait, let me check that. The total in column (a) is 1,217,121. But 1,211,143 (approved) plus 5,978 (not approved) equals 1,217,121, which matches the total. That makes sense.\n\nSo the percentage would be (approved / total) * 100. So that's (1,211,143 / 1,217,121) * 100. Let me calculate that. \n\nFirst, divide 1,211,143 by 1,217,121. Let me do that division. Let's see, 1,211,143 divided by 1,217,121. Hmm. Let me approximate. Since both numbers are close, the result should be just under 100%. Let me compute it more precisely. \n\nThe difference between numerator and denominator is 1,217,121 - 1,211,143 = 5,978. So the numerator is 5,978 less than the denominator.

Hmm, the user is asking for a percentage change, which usually requires knowing the values for both years and then applying the formula: ((New Value - Old Value)/Old Value) * 100.\n\nFirst, I need to check the context for any specific numbers related to the carrying amount of goodwill in 2016 and 2017. Let me read through the context again carefully.\n\nThe context mentions that in 2017, the company expects $79.2 million of goodwill to be tax deductible, and in 2016, $3.0 million is expected to be tax deductible. Wait, but tax deductibility of goodwill isn't the same as the carrying amount. The carrying amount is the value of goodwill on the balance sheet. The tax deductible part refers to how much can be deducted for tax purposes, which might relate to amortization or impairment, but not directly the carrying value.\n\nLooking further, the context states that there has been no impairment of goodwill in any of the years presented. That's important because impairment would reduce the carrying amount. Also, in the fourth quarter of 2017, the company sold the equipment care business, which was a reporting unit, and the goodwill associated with it was disposed of. So, the sale would remove that portion of goodwill from the carrying amount in 2017.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the percentage change from 2016 to 2017. The context doesn't explicitly state the total carrying amounts for those years. Hmm, maybe the information is in the first sentence? The first line says \"the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for each of the company 2019s reportable segments are as follows...\" but that's about 2019, not 2016 or 2017. So maybe the context doesn't provide the actual numbers for 2016 and 2017? That's a problem because without the actual carrying amounts, we can't compute the percentage change.\n\nWait, maybe there's an implication here.

          "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking for the percentage increase in total expense from 2017 to 2018. I need to look at the context provided to find the relevant numbers.\n\nLooking at the context, there's a section about income taxes with a table. The rows are \"current expense (benefit)\", \"deferred expense (benefit)\", \"total expense\", and \"effective income tax rate\". The columns are for 2018 and 2017. \n\nUnder \"total expense\", for 2018 it's \"$156\" and for 2017 it's \"$15\". Wait, the numbers might be in millions or something, but the actual values are 156 and 15. \n\nTo calculate the percentage increase from 2017 to 2018, the formula is ((New Value - Old Value)/Old Value) * 100. Here, New Value is 156 (2018) and Old Value is 15 (2017). \n\nSo subtracting 15 from 156 gives 141. Then divide by 15: 141 / 15 = 9.4. Multiply by 100 to get the percentage: 940%. That seems really high, but looking at the numbers, 15 to 156 is indeed a 940% increase. Let me double-check the numbers from the context. Yes, the total expense in 2017 is $15 and in 2018 it's $156. So the calculation is correct. The answer should be 940%.\n</think>\n\nThe percentage increase in total expense from 2017 to 2018 is calculated as follows:  \n\n- **2017 Total Expense**: $15  \n- **2018 Total Expense**: $156  \n\n**Formula**:  \n$$\n\\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{156 - 15}{15} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{141}{15} \\right) \\times 100 = 940\\%\n$$\n\n**Answer**: 940",

          "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking for the percentage change in the risk-free rate from 2003 to 2004. The context provided has a table with data for 2003, 2004, and 2005. The first row is the risk-free interest rate for each year.\n\nLooking at the table, the risk-free rate in 2003 is 2.92%, and in 2004 it's 2.56%. To find the percentage change, I need to calculate the difference between these two values and then divide by the original value (2003's rate), then multiply by 100 to get the percentage.\n\nSo the formula is ((New - Old)/Old) * 100. Here, New is 2004's rate (2.56%) and Old is 2003's rate (2.92%). \n\nFirst, subtract 2.92 from 2.56: 2.56 - 2.92 = -0.36. Then divide that by 2.92: -0.36 / 2.92 \u2248 -0.1233. Multiply by 100 to get the percentage: -12.33%. \n\nSo the percentage change is a decrease of approximately 12.33%. Since the question just asks for the percentage change, the negative sign indicates a decrease, but maybe they just want the absolute value. But percentage change typically includes the sign to show increase or decrease. Let me double-check the numbers from the table again to make sure I didn't mix up the years. Yes, 2003 is 2.92%, 2004 is 2.56%. So the calculation is correct. The answer should be -12.33%, but maybe rounded to one decimal place as -12.3%. Alternatively, the question might expect the absolute value, but percentage change usually includes direction. Let me confirm the calculation once more. Yes, the steps are right. So the answer is approximately -12.3%.\n</think>\n\nThe percentage change in the risk-free rate from 2003 to 2004 is calculated as follows:\n\n1. **Risk-free rate in",

Looking at the table, there's a column labeled \"immediate change in rates +200bp\" which should correspond to a 2% increase.\n\nFor December 31, 2005, the value under +200bp is $265 million.

However, since the euro's values are given as 26.4 and 27.1 without currency symbols, they might be in the same units as the others, possibly millions or just numerical values. The key is that the actual numbers are there for calculation. \n\nAlso, the context mentions that the total impact in 2012 is $90.3, but the question is specifically about the euro's impact. The answer should focus only on the euro's numbers. \n\nNo other information in the context seems relevant to the euro's percentage change. The rest of the text talks about foreign currency impact and derivatives, but the numbers needed are in the table. \n\nSo the calculation should be straightforward. Let me verify the subtraction and division again. 27.1 minus 26.4 is indeed 0.7. Divided by 26.4 gives approximately 0.0265, which is 2.65%. Rounding to two decimal places would",

The table shows the balance on December 30, 2017, as previously reported, which is $341,003 thousand. Then there are cumulative effect adjustments. The adjustments include adding $91,640 thousand from Topic 606, $2,638 thousand from financial instruments, and subtracting $8,349 thousand from income taxes. So the adjusted balance as of December 30, 2017, is $426,932 thousand.

Let me confirm.\n\nYes, the table shows that after the adjusted beginning balance of $426,932, they add net income of $345,777 to get to the ending balance of $772,709. So the increase during 2018 is the net income. Therefore, the percentage change would be (Net Income / Beginning Adjusted Retained Earnings) * 100. So that's (345,777 / 426,932) *",

Let me make sure I get the numbers right. The rent expense for 2007 is $168 million, 2008 is $205 million, and 2009 is $216 million.

The table provided lists the amounts for each year, including 2018 as $760,000 (in thousands). But wait, the question is about the interest applied to these maturities.

Also, there's mention of financing authorizations from various regulatory bodies. However, none of these sections directly state the interest rates or the interest amounts for the debt maturities. \n\nThe context also includes details about a capital funds agreement where Entergy has to maintain equity at 35% of total capitalization, but that's about equity, not interest. There's a mention of a liability recorded as the net present value of payments for power plants, but again, not directly about interest on debt maturities.\n\nWait, the question is specifically about the interest applied to the 2018 maturities. The problem is that the context provided doesn't include any explicit information about interest rates or the calculation of interest for those maturities. The table only lists the principal amounts due each year. Without additional data on the interest rates or the method used to calculate interest, it's impossible to determine the exact interest amount from the given context. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be that the information isn't provided in the context. The user might be confusing the principal with the total payment (principal plus interest), but since the context doesn't specify interest rates or separate principal from interest in the maturities, we can't compute it.

          "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking for the total equity in 2009 based on the provided context. First, I need to look at the data given. The context has a table with different line items for the years 2009, 2008, and 2007.\n\nThe line items are trading assets and liabilities. There are two types of trading assets: debt and equity instruments, and derivative receivables. Similarly, trading liabilities include debt and equity instruments and derivative payables. \n\nThe question is about total equity in 2009. But wait, equity isn't directly listed here. The user might be referring to shareholders' equity, but the data provided is about trading assets and liabilities. However, maybe the question is asking for the net equity related to trading activities. Let me check the numbers again.\n\nLooking at the 2009 row for trading assets: debt and equity instruments are $318,063 million and derivative receivables are $110,457 million. So total trading assets would be 318,063 + 110,457 = 428,520 million.\n\nThen, trading liabilities for 2009: debt and equity instruments (a) are $60,224 million and derivative payables are $77,901 million. Total liabilities would be 60,224 + 77,901 = 138,125 million.\n\nIf we subtract total liabilities from total assets, that would give the net equity. So 428,520 - 138,125 = 290,395 million. But wait, the note says that trading liabilities (a) primarily represent securities sold, not yet purchased. That might mean that these liabilities are related to short positions or something similar.

The user is asking about the nuclear realized price changes as a percentage of the decrease in net revenue from 2011 to 2012. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the context provided. The table shows that the 2011 net revenue was $2045 million and in 2012 it's $1854 million. The decrease in net revenue is $2045 - $1854 = $191 million. The question mentions that the decrease is $191 million, which matches the context.\n\nNow, the nuclear realized price changes are listed as -194 million (in parentheses 194, but the negative sign is there). The question is asking what percentage this nuclear price change is of the total decrease in net revenue. \n\nSo, the formula would be (nuclear realized price changes / total decrease in net revenue) * 100. Plugging in the numbers: (-194 / 191) * 100. Wait, but percentages can't be negative in this context, maybe they just want the absolute value. Let me check the context again. The explanation says the decrease was primarily due to lower pricing (which is the nuclear realized price changes at -194) and lower volume (-33), partially offset by other (+36). \n\nSo the total decrease is 191 million. The nuclear price change is -194 million. But since we're talking about the contribution to the decrease, maybe we take absolute values. Let me calculate (-194 / 191) * 100. That would be approximately -101.57%. But that can't be right because the total decrease is 191, and the nuclear price change alone is -194. Wait, but the total decrease is 191, but the nuclear price change is -194. That suggests that the nuclear price change is actually slightly more than 100% of the total decrease, but that's impossible because there are other factors.

          "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking for the percent change in the number of non-vested shares in 2012. Hmm. So first, I need to figure out what the numbers are for the beginning and end of the year.\n\nLooking at the context provided, there's a table that shows the changes to the company's non-vested performance awards in 2012. The first row is \"non-vested performance awards at beginning of year\" which is 707 thousand shares. Then, during the year, they granted 203 thousand, vested -379 thousand (which is a subtraction), cancellations and other -22 thousand. The ending balance is 509 thousand shares.\n\nSo the beginning number is 707,000 shares and the ending is 509,000. The question is about the percent change between these two numbers. \n\nPercent change formula is ((Ending - Beginning)/Beginning) * 100. Let me plug in the numbers. \n\nEnding is 509, beginning is 707. So 509 - 707 = -198. Then divide by 707: -198 / 707 \u2248 -0.28. Multiply by 100 gives -28%. So the percent change is a decrease of 28%. \n\nWait, let me double-check the math. 707 minus 509 is 198. So the decrease is 198 from the beginning. 198 divided by 707. Let me calculate that more accurately. 198 \u00f7 707. Let's see, 707 times 0.28 is 197.96, which is approximately 198. So yes, that's about 28% decrease. Therefore, the percent change is -28%. But since the question asks for the percent change, maybe they just want the absolute value, but usually percent change includes the sign. The answer should be -28%, but maybe they want it as a positive number with a note that it's a decrease.

The context provided has data for 2017, 2016, and 2015.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the \"initial health care trend rate\" row. The values given are 8.00% for 2017, 8.25% for 2016, and 8.00% for 2015. The question is about the three-year period, so these three years are 2015, 2016, and 2017. \n\nTo find the average, I should add these three percentages and then divide by three. Let me check the numbers again. 2015 is 8.00%, 2016 is 8.25%, and 2017 is 8.00%. Adding them together: 8.00 + 8.25 + 8.00 equals 24.25%. Dividing that by 3 gives 24.25 / 3 = 8.0833...%. Rounding to two decimal places, that would be 8.08%. \n\nWait, but maybe the question expects a different approach? Let me make sure I didn't miss any other years. The context mentions 2015, 2016, 2017. The three-year period is those three years. The answer seems straightforward. The average is (8.00 + 8.25 + 8.00)/3 = 8.08%. So the answer should be 8.08%.\n</think>\n\nThe average initial health care trend rate for the three-year period (2015\u20132017) is calculated by summing the annual rates and dividing by three:  \n(8.00% + 8.25% + 8.00%) / 3 = **8.08%**.  \n\nAnswer: 8.08%",

          "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking what portion of the total 2015 restructuring programs is related to termination benefits. Let me look at the context provided.\n\nFirst, I need to find the numbers related to 2015. The table shows that for 2015 restructuring programs, the termination benefits are $5009 (in thousands), and the total for 2015 is $6304 (in thousands). The question is asking for the portion, so that would be the termination benefits divided by the total.\n\nWait, let me confirm. The 2015 restructuring programs row has termination benefits as $5009, facility closure $231, contract termination $1000, other exit costs $64, and total $6304. So adding up the components: 5009 + 231 is 5240, plus 1000 is 6240, plus 64 gives 6304. That matches the total. So the portion is 5009 / 6304. Let me calculate that.\n\nDividing 5009 by 6304. Let me do the division. Let's see, 5009 \u00f7 6304 \u2248 0.7946. So that's approximately 79.46%. The answer should be this percentage. The user wants the portion, so probably rounded to one decimal place or as a fraction. But since the question says \"portion,\" maybe they want the exact value or a rounded percentage. Let me check if there are any other numbers that might be relevant. The total restructuring charges for 2015 in the table is $7819, but that's the total across all years. Wait, no, the question specifically refers to the 2015 restructuring programs, which is the row labeled \"2015 restructuring programs\" with total $6304. So the answer is 5009/6304. Let me compute that more accurately.\n\nCalculating 5009 divided by 6304. Let me use a calculator approach. Let's approximate:\n\n6304 * 0.79 = 6304 * 0.7 +",

The table has rows for each year: 2006, 2005, 2004. The \"cash flow\" row shows the amounts. For 2006, it's $957.4 million, 2005 is $769.1 million, and 2004 is $950.4 million. \n\nWait, let me confirm that. The table lists under \"cash flow\" for 2006: $957.4, 2005: $769.1, and 2004: $950.4.

Looking at the context provided, the first sentence says: \"the weighted average interest rates on outstanding borrowings were 3.5% (3.5%), 5.3% (5.3%) and 5.9% (5.9%) for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.\"\n\nWait, the order here is 2011, 2010, 2009.

So the formula for percentage decrease is ((Old Value - New Value)/Old Value) * 100. Here, the old value is 2010's rate (5.3%) and the new value is 2011's rate (3.5%). \n\nCalculating the difference: 5.3 - 3.5 = 1.8. Then divide that by the old value (5.3) and multiply by 100.

The user is asking about the par value of the fixed rate notes due February 2014 compared to the term loan due 2011 as of December 31, 2010.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the context provided. The context has a table with different debt instruments and their par values. Let me scan through the entries.\n\nLooking at the first entry: term loan due 2011 has a par value of $420.5 million. Then there's an entry for fixed rate notes due February 2014 with a par value of $750.0 million. \n\nSo the question is comparing these two. The user wants to know the par value of each. The answer should state both numbers and perhaps the comparison. Let me double-check the context to make sure I'm not missing any other details. \n\nThe term loan is listed as \"$420.5\" under the par value column. The fixed rate notes due February 2014 are \"750.0\". The units are in millions, so those are in millions of dollars. \n\nThe other entries are for different notes, but the question specifically mentions the fixed rate notes due February 2014 and the term loan due 2011. The answer should just be those two numbers. \n\nWait, the context also mentions a senior credit facility with a $1.4 billion total, including the term loan and revolving credit. But the question is only about the par value of the specific two debts. So the answer is straightforward from the table. \n\nSo the term loan due 2011 is $420.5 million, and the fixed rate notes due February 2014 are $750.0 million. The answer should present both values clearly.\n</think>\n\nAs of December 31, 2010, the par value of the **fixed rate notes due February 2014** was **$750.0 million**, while the par value of the **term loan due 2011** was **$420.5 million**. \n\nThus, the fixed rate notes due February 2014 had a larger par value compared to the term loan due 2011.",

          "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking for the percentage of operating cash flow distributed to shareholders in 2011. The context provided has some financial data, so I need to parse through that.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what the operating cash flow was for 2011. Looking at the table, under \"cash provided by operating activities,\" the 2011 value is $5,873 million. Then, the question is about what percent was distributed to shareholders. Shareholders typically receive dividends, so I should look at the dividends paid in 2011. In the table, under \"dividends paid,\" 2011 shows -$837 million. The negative sign probably indicates it's an outflow, so the actual amount is $837 million.\n\nWait, but the free cash flow is calculated as operating cash flow adjusted minus investing activities and dividends. The formula given is free cash flow = adjusted operating cash flow - cash used in investing - dividends. But the question isn't about free cash flow; it's specifically about the percentage of operating cash flow that went to shareholders. So shareholders get dividends, so I think it's just dividends divided by operating cash flow.\n\nSo for 2011, operating cash flow is $5,873 million. Dividends paid are $837 million. So the percentage would be (837 / 5873) * 100. Let me calculate that. \n\nFirst, divide 837 by 5873. Let me do that division. Let's see, 5873 goes into 837... Well, 5873 * 0.14 is about 822.22. So 0.14 would be roughly 822.22. The actual value is 837, which is a bit higher. Let's compute 837 / 5873 exactly. \n\nLet me use a calculator approach here. 837 divided by 5873 equals approximately 0.1425. Multiply by 100 gives 14.25%. So approximately 14.25%. Let me check if there's any other component to distributions to shareholders. The context mentions free cash flow, but the question is specifically",

Looking at the table, there's a row labeled \"total\" under each category. For \"american\", the total is 61,600. For \"us airways\", the total is 32,800. \n\nWait, the question is about the ratio of American to US Airways. So I need to take the total personnel of American divided by the total personnel of US Airways. \n\nSo that would be 61,600 divided by 32,800. Let me calculate that. \n\nDividing both numbers by 1,000 to simplify: 61.6 / 32.8. Let me do the division. 32.8 goes into 61.6 about 1.878 times. To express this as a ratio, it's approximately 1.88:1. But ratios are often presented in whole numbers. Let me check if there's a simpler way. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can reduce the fraction. Let's see, 61600 divided by 32800. Both numbers can be divided by 400, perhaps? Let's try dividing numerator and denominator by 400: 61600 \u00f7 400 = 154, 32800 \u00f7 400 = 82. So 154:82.

The context mentions that for the consumer portfolio, the allowance was $12.393 billion at December 31, 2007, and $22.366 billion at December 31, 2008. \n\nSo the increase in dollars would be 2008 value minus 2007 value. Let me calculate that: 22.366 - 12.393 = 9.973 billion. \n\nNow, to find the percentage increase, I need to take that increase and divide it by the original 2007 value, then multiply by 100 to get the percentage. \n\nSo, 9.973 / 12.393 = approximately 0.8047. Multiplying by 100 gives 80.47%. \n\nWait, the answer should be the percentage increase. Let me check the numbers again. The 2007 value is $12.393B and 2008 is $22.366B.

Hmm, but wait, the context provided has data up to 2008. Let me check the context again.\n\nLooking at the context, there are two entries for Bermuda subsidiaries in 2008. The statutory capital and surplus for Bermuda subsidiaries in 2008 is $7001 million, and the statutory net income is $684 million. The question is about 2009, but there's no data provided for 2009 in the context. The latest data is from 2008. The user might have made a mistake or there's a typo. Maybe they meant 2008? Let me confirm.\n\nThe context mentions data for 2006, 2007, 2008. The question is about 2009, which isn't present. The answer would require data from 2009, but since it's not available, perhaps the user intended to ask for 2008. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to infer 2009 data from the given information? Let me check the other parts of the context again.\n\nThere's a mention of the U.S. subsidiaries' impact on statutory capital and surplus in 2008, 2007, and 2006. But the question is about Bermuda subsidiaries. The context states that there are no statutory restrictions on dividends from retained earnings for Bermuda subsidiaries. However, the actual numbers for Bermuda's statutory capital and surplus and net income are given for 2008, 2007, and 2006. \n\nSince there's no 2009 data provided, the correct approach would be to point out that the data isn't available in the context. But maybe the user expects using the 2008 data as the closest available. If the question is a typo and they meant 2008, then the ratio would be 7001 / 684. Let me calculate that. \n\n7001 divided by 684 is approximately 10.23. So the ratio would be around 10.23:1. But since the",

The user is asking for the percentage of total debt compared to lease obligations and purchase obligations in 2007 as part of the contractual obligations for future payments. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the context provided. The table lists the amounts for each category in different years. For 2007, the total debt is $692 million, lease obligations are $144 million, and purchase obligations are $2329 million. \n\nWait, the question is asking for the percent of total debt compared to the sum of lease and purchase obligations. So I need to add lease and purchase obligations first. Let me check the numbers again.\n\nTotal debt in 2007: $692 million (from the \"total debt (a)\" row, 2007 column). Lease obligations in 2007: $144 million (from the \"lease obligations (b)\" row). Purchase obligations in 2007: $2329 million (from the \"purchase obligations (cd)\" row). \n\nAdding lease and purchase obligations: 144 + 2329 = 2473 million. Then, total debt is 692. So the percentage would be (692 / 2473) * 100. Let me calculate that. \n\n692 divided by 2473 equals approximately 0.2798. Multiplying by 100 gives about 27.98%. So rounding to two decimal places, that's 28.0%. \n\nWait, but I need to make sure I'm interpreting the question correctly. The question says \"the percent of the total debt compared to lease obligations and purchase obligations\". So total debt is part of the total of lease and purchase? So yes, the formula is (Total Debt / (Lease + Purchase)) * 100. \n\nLet me double-check the numbers. The total debt for 2007 is definitely $692 million. Lease obligations are $144 million, purchase obligations $2329. Adding them gives 2473. So 692 divided by 2473 is approximately 27.98%, which rounds to 28.0%. \n\nI think that's correct.

Hmm, first I need to figure out what the consolidated net sales were in those years.\n\nLooking at the context provided, there's a table with numbers. The first row under \"(dollars in millions)\" shows the years ended December 31 for 2008, 2007, 2006, etc. The second row is labeled \"segment net sales\" with values $12,099 million for 2008, $18,988 million for 2007, and $28,383 million for 2006. Wait, but the question is about consolidated net sales, not just the segment. However, the context mentions that in 2008, the segment's net sales were 40% of consolidated sales. Similarly, in 2007 it was 52%, and 2006 was 66%. \n\nSo if I can use that percentage to find the total consolidated sales. Let me think. For 2008, segment net sales are $12,099 million, which is 40% of consolidated. So total consolidated sales in 2008 would be 12,099 / 0.40. Let me calculate that: 12,099 divided by 0.4 is 30,247.5 million. \n\nFor 2006, the segment's net sales were $28,383 million, which was 66% of consolidated.

The context provided has a table with data points for each year from 2007 to 2012 for Ball Corporation, the DJ US Containers & Packaging index, and the S&P 500.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what ROI (Return on Investment) is. ROI is calculated as (Final Value - Initial Investment) / Initial Investment * 100 to get a percentage. \n\nLooking at the table, the initial investment is $100 on 12/31/2007. For Ball Corporation, the value on 12/31/2012 is $207.62. So the ROI would be (207.62 - 100) / 100 * 100. That gives 107.62%. \n\nWait, but I should check if there are any other factors. The note says it assumes $100 invested on 12/31/2007 with dividends reinvested. The numbers in the table already account for reinvested dividends, right? Because the total return includes dividends. So the value in 2012 is $207.62, so the ROI is indeed 107.62%. \n\nLet me cross-verify with the other indices. For example, the S&P 500 went from $100 to $97.13, so their ROI is (97.13 - 100)/100 = -2.87%. The DJ index went from 100 to 107.76, so ROI is 7.76%. That makes sense. So Ball's ROI is higher. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 107.62%. But the question might want it rounded or in a different format.

Dividing by 150.27 gives roughly 0.0743, so 7.43%. That seems correct. \n\nI should make sure there's no other data that might affect this calculation. The context mentions that the returns are based on market capitalization and reinvestment of dividends, but since the numbers provided already account for that, the calculation should be straightforward. \n\nTherefore, the percentage change from 2014 to 2015",

The user is asking for the total number of shares repurchased during two specific periods: November 1, 2013, to November 30, 2013, and December 1, 2013, to December 31, 2013. \n\nLooking at the provided context, there's a table with data for different periods. The first column has the period dates, and the second column lists the total number of shares purchased. \n\nFor the first period, 11/01/04 2013 11/30/04, the number is 5145 shares. Then, for the second period, 12/01/04 2013 12/31/04, it's 34526 shares. The user wants the total of these two. \n\nI need to add those two numbers together. Let me check the numbers again to make sure I'm not mixing up any other periods. The first one is November, which is 5145, and December is 34526. Adding them: 5145 + 34526. Let me do the math.\n\n5145 + 34526 equals... let's see, 5000 + 34500 is 39500, and then 145 + 26 is 171, so total is 39500 + 171 = 39671.

The answer should be that number. Let me double-check the table entries again to ensure I didn't pick the wrong rows. The November row is 5145 and December is 34526. Yes, that's correct.

The last row of the table is labeled \"fair value per option granted\" and the values are $44.11 for 2014, $39.03 for 2013, and $29.65 for 2012. Wait, so 2013 is $39.03 and 2014 is $44.11. \n\nTo calculate the percentage increase from 2013 to 2014, the formula is ((New Value - Old Value)/Old Value) * 100. So here, the new value is 2014's fair value, which is $44.11, and the old value is 2013's, $39.03. \n\nLet me do the math. Subtract 39.03 from 44.11: 44.11 - 39.03 = 5.08. Then divide that by 39.03. So 5.08 / 39.03. Let me compute that. Let's see, 5 divided by 39 is approximately 0.128. So 0.128 times 100 is 12.8%. Let me check with the exact numbers. 5.08 divided by 39.03.

          "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking about the percentage change in recorded net losses from 2007 to 2008 as a result of the sales of certain non-core towers and other assets. \n\nFirst, I need to find the net losses for those two years. Looking at the context provided, there's a section that mentions the company recorded net losses and impairments for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006. Specifically, it says: \"the company recorded net losses and impairments of approximately $10.5 million, $7.1 million and $2.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.\" \n\nSo, for 2007, the net loss is $7.1 million, and for 2008, it's $10.5 million. The question is about the change from 2007 to 2008. \n\nTo calculate the percentage change, the formula is ((New Value - Old Value) / Old Value) * 100. Here, the old value is 2007's loss ($7.1M) and the new value is 2008's ($10.5M). \n\nSubtracting 7.1 from 10.5 gives 3.4. Then divide that by 7.1, which equals approximately 0.4789. Multiplying by 100 gives about 47.89%. So the percentage increase is roughly 47.89%. \n\nWait, but the question specifies \"as a result of the sales of certain non-core towers and other assets.\" The context mentions that the net losses include those from asset sales and impairments. The numbers given for 2007 and 2008 in that specific context are $7.1M and $10.5M respectively. So the calculation should be correct. \n\nLet me double-check the numbers. The text says for 2008, the net loss is $10.5 million and for 2007 it's $7.1 million. The calculation is ((10.5 - 7.1)/7",

          "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out the answer to this question. The question is asking for the npm adjustment items as a percentage of the operating companies income increase. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the context provided. The context mentions that the operating companies income increased by $824 million (13.2%). The reasons for this increase include higher pricing ($765 million), npm adjustment items ($664 million), and lower costs, partially offset by lower shipment volume and higher charges.\n\nSo, the key numbers here are the operating companies income increase of $824 million and the npm adjustment items contributing $664 million. The question is asking what percentage of that $824 million increase is attributed to the npm adjustment items.\n\nTo calculate the percentage, I think the formula would be (npm adjustment contribution / total income increase) * 100. That would be (664 / 824) * 100. Let me check if that's correct. \n\nYes, because percentage contribution is part over whole times 100. So plugging in the numbers: 664 divided by 824. Let me do the division first. \n\nCalculating 664 \u00f7 824. Let me see. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 8 to simplify. 664 \u00f78 is 83, 824 \u00f78 is 103. So 83/103. Let me compute that. 83 divided by 103 is approximately 0.8058. Multiply by 100 gives 80.58%. So approximately 80.6%. \n\nWait, but let me check with exact numbers. Maybe I made a simplification error. Let me use a calculator approach. 664 divided by 824. Let's see:\n\n824 goes into 664 zero times. Add decimal. 824 into 6640. Let's see how many times 824 fits into 6640. 824*8 is 6592. Subtract that from 6640: 6640 - 6592 = 48. Bring down a zero: 480. 824 goes into",

The context states:\n\n\"Of these amounts, $2.86 billion and $2.87 billion as of December 2015 and December 2014, respectively, relate to commitments to invest in funds managed by the firm.\"\n\nTherefore, the total for 2015 and 2014 relating to commitments to invest in funds managed by the firm was:\n\n2015: $2.86 billion\n2014: $2.87 billion",
          "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking for the total in billions for 2015 and 2014 relating to commitments to invest in funds managed by the firm.\n\nLooking at the context provided, there's a part that says: \"of these amounts , $ 2.86 billion and $ 2.87 billion as of december 2015 and december 2014 , respectively , relate to commitments to invest in funds managed by the firm.\" So, for 2015 it's $2.86 billion and for 2014 it's $2.87 billion. \n\nWait, the question is asking for the total for both years combined. So I need to add those two numbers together. Let me check again. The numbers are 2.86 (2015) and 2.87 (2014). Adding them: 2.86 + 2.87 equals 5.73 billion. \n\nBut wait, the question says \"in billions,\" so the answer should be in billions. The numbers given are already in billions, so adding them gives 5.73. Let me make sure I didn't mix up the years. The context says \"as of december 2015 and december 2014, respectively,\" so 2015 is first, then 2014. The question is asking for the total for both years, so adding them is correct. \n\nI don't see any other numbers related to funds managed by the firm. The other numbers like $6.05 billion and $5.16 billion are total investment commitments, but the question specifically asks about commitments to invest in funds managed by the firm, which are the $2.86B and $2.87B. So the total is indeed 2.86 + 2.87 = 5.73 billion. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 5.73 billion.\n</think>\n\nThe total for 2015 and 2014 relating to commitments to invest in funds managed by the firm was **$5.73 billion**.

The user is asking what percent of the total amount outstanding is due to the notes payable that are due at mutually agreed-upon dates within one year of issuance or on demand.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the context provided. There's a table with two entries under \"outstanding as of may 31 2009 (in millions)\". The first row is \"notes payable due at mutually agreed-upon dates...\" with a value of $342.9 million.

Well, 421.4 times 0.8 is 337.12. That's close to 342.9. The difference is 342.9 - 337.12 = 5.78. So 0.8 + (5.78 / 421.4). 5.78 divided by 421.4 is approximately 0.0137.

The context provided has both basic and diluted numbers.\n\nLooking at the table, for 2008, basic net income available for common shareholders is $56,616 thousand, and diluted is $59,584 thousand. The question just says \"net income per common share,\" which can sometimes refer to basic by default, but it's not always clear. However, since the context explains both, maybe I should check if there's more info.\n\nThe context mentions that basic is calculated by dividing net income by weighted average shares. For 2008, the weighted average number of common shares outstanding is 146,915 thousand. For diluted, they add potential dilutive securities, resulting in 155,041 thousand shares. \n\nBut the question doesn't specify basic or diluted. However, in financial reporting, when someone asks for net income per share without specifying, it might depend on the standard. In some cases, GAAP requires both to be reported. But since the user is asking for a specific number, maybe they want both? Wait, the answer format is expecting a single answer. Let me check the context again.\n\nThe user's question is from Duke Realty Corporation's 2008 annual report. Typically, companies report both basic and diluted EPS. However, the question is phrased as \"net income per common share,\" which could be either. But in the absence of specification, maybe the answer is the basic one. Let me check the numbers again.\n\nBasic net income per share for 2008 would be $56,616 divided by 146,915. Let me calculate that. 56,616 / 146,915 \u2248 0.3855, so approximately $0.39 per share.

The context provides a table with values for each year. \n\nFirst, I need to find the initial and final values. In 2004, the value is $100.00, and in 2009, it's $160.62. The growth rate can be calculated using the formula for compound annual growth rate (CAGR), which is (Ending Value / Beginning Value)^(1 / Number of Years) - 1.\n\nSo, the ending value is 160.62, beginning is 100. The period is from 2004 to 2009, which is 5 years. Plugging in the numbers: (160.62 / 100)^(1/5) - 1. Let me calculate that. \n\n160.62 divided by 100 is 1.6062. The fifth root of 1.6062 is approximately 1.10 (since 1.1^5 is about 1.6105). So the CAGR is roughly 10%. But let me check more accurately. Maybe using a calculator: ln(1.6062) is about 0.475, divided by 5 gives 0.095, exponentiating gives e^0.095 \u2248 1.10, so around 10%.

The question is asking for the percentage change in the fair value of the company's interest in Pennymac from 2016 to 2017. \n\nFirst, I need to find the fair values for those two years. Let me check the context provided.\n\nLooking at the first paragraph, it mentions that the fair value of the company's interest was approximately $348 million at December 31, 2017, and $259 million at December 31, 2016. Wait, let me confirm that. The context says: \"the carrying value and fair value of the company 2019s interest [...] was approximately $342 million and $348 million, respectively, at December 31, 2017 and approximately $301 million and $259 million, respectively, at December 31, 2016.\" \n\nSo, the fair value in 2017 is $348 million and in 2016 it's $259 million. The percentage change is calculated by taking the difference between the two values, dividing by the original value (2016), and then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage.\n\nLet me compute that. The difference is 348 - 259 = 89 million. Then divide that by 259: 89 / 259 \u2248 0.3436. Multiply by 100 gives approximately 34.36%. So the percentage change is about 34.36%. \n\nWait, let me double-check the numbers. The fair value in 2017 is $348 million, and in 2016 it's $259 million. Yes, that's correct. The calculation seems right. So the answer should be approximately 34.36%, which I can round to one decimal place if needed, maybe 34.4%. Alternatively, the question might expect a whole number, but the exact calculation is better. Let me verify once more. \n\nYes, 348 minus 259 is 89.

Let me check the table again.\n\nLooking at the table labeled \"investment securities table 11\", there are numbers for December 31, 2011. The columns are \"december 31 2012 amortized cost\", \"december 31 2012 fair value\", \"december 31 2011 amortized cost\", \"fair value\". Wait, maybe the 2011 numbers are in the last two columns? Let me parse the table again.\n\nThe table's rows are:\n- Total securities available for sale (a): 49447 (amortized cost 2012), 51052 (fair value 2012), 48609 (amortized cost 2011?), 48568 (fair value 2011?)\n- Total securities held to maturity: 10354 (2012 amortized), 10860 (2012 fair), 12066 (2011 amortized?), 12450 (2011 fair?)\n- Total securities: 59801 (2012 amortized), 61912",

The question specifically asks about the U.S. employee share purchase plan for 2015. \n\nIn the context, under the employee share purchase plan, it says that for the three-year periods beginning in 2015, 2014, and 2013, the maximum shares allowed for purchase were 100,000, 300,000, and 350,000 respectively.

For the 2015 period, the maximum is 100,000 shares. But the actual issued in 2015 under the plan was 2,779 shares. However, the question is about the average share price for shares issued in 2015. \n\nBut how do we find the average share price?

This can be calculated by subtracting the ending amount for Ball Corporation ($207.62) from the ending amount for the S&P 500 ($97.13).",
          "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking for the five-year total return of Ball Corporation stock compared to the S&P 500, specifically how much greater Ball's return is. The data provided is in a table with values for each year from 2007 to 2012.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the total return for Ball Corporation and the S&P 500 over the five-year period. The values given start at $100 on 12/31/2007 and show the cumulative total return each subsequent year. \n\nLooking at the Ball Corporation row, the value on 12/31/2012 is $207.62. Since the initial investment was $100, the total return is the final amount minus the initial investment. So that would be 207.62 - 100 = 107.62%. Wait, actually, the total return percentage is calculated by (Final Value / Initial Value) - 1, then multiplied by 100 to get a percentage. So (207.62 / 100) - 1 = 1.0762, which is 107.62% return. \n\nNow for the S&P 500, the value on 12/31/2012 is $97.13. Using the same calculation: (97.13 / 100) - 1 = -0.0287, which is a -2.87% return. Wait, that can't be right. If the value went from 100 to 97.13, that's a loss. But the question is about total return, which includes reinvested dividends, so maybe the numbers are correct. \n\nSo the difference between Ball Corporation's return and the S&P 500's return would be 107.62% - (-2.87%) = 107.62% + 2.87% = 110.49%. Therefore, Ball's return was 110.49% greater than the S&P 500's over the five years. \n\nBut let me double-check the numbers. Ball's",

          "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking what portion of the total estimated purchase price is paid in cash. The context provided has a table and some additional details.\n\nFirst, looking at the table, the first row is \"cash portion of consideration\" which is $2,094,800. Then there's a total estimated purchase price of $6,156,900. So the cash portion is part of that total. \n\nBut wait, the problem might be to find the percentage or just the amount. The question says \"what portion,\" which could mean the percentage. But sometimes \"portion\" might just refer to the amount. Let me check the exact wording again. The user is asking for \"what portion of the total estimated purchase price is paid in cash?\" So the answer is likely the cash amount divided by the total.\n\nSo the cash is $2,094,800 and total is $6,156,900. Let me calculate that. \n\nDividing 2,094,800 by 6,156,900. Let me do that. Let's see, 2,094,800 \u00f7 6,156,900 \u2248 0.34, which is 34%. But maybe they want the exact figure. Let me compute it more precisely. \n\n2,094,800 divided by 6,156,900. Let me do the division step by step. \n\nFirst, both numbers can be divided by 100 to simplify: 20948 / 61569. Let me approximate. 61569 \u00d7 0.34 = 61569 \u00d7 0.3 + 61569 \u00d7 0.04 = 18470.7 + 2462.76 = 20933.46. That's very close to 20948. So 0.34 would be approximately 34%. The exact value would be 20948 / 61569 \u2248 0.34, so 34%. \n\nBut maybe the answer expects the exact dollar amount as the portion. Wait,",

The question is asking: \"Hard assets were what percent of the Brazilian purchase price, as finally determined?\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"hard assets\" refer to here. In financial contexts, hard assets typically mean tangible assets, like property, plant, and equipment. So, looking at the context provided, the allocation table includes \"property and equipment\" and \"current assets\" and \"non-current assets.\" Maybe \"hard assets\" here are the tangible assets, which would include property and equipment, current assets, and maybe other non-current assets except intangibles. But I need to check the table.\n\nLooking at the table under the \"final purchase price allocation (1)\" column. The assets acquired would be current assets, non-current assets, property and equipment, intangible assets, etc. But since intangible assets are separate, maybe hard assets are the tangible ones. Let me see.\n\nThe table shows:\n\nCurrent assets: $9,922 (thousands)\nNon-current assets: $71,529 (thousands)\nProperty and equipment: $83,539 (thousands)\nIntangible assets: $368,000 (thousands)\nCurrent liabilities: -$5,536\nOther non-current liabilities: -$38,519\nFair value of net assets acquired: $488,935 (thousands)\nGoodwill: $96,395 (thousands)\n\nWait, the \"fair value of net assets acquired\" is calculated as the total of assets acquired minus liabilities assumed. Let me check the numbers. \n\nBut the question is about the hard assets as part of the Brazilian purchase price. The total purchase price was finally determined as $585.3 million after adjustments. The allocation of the purchase price is given in the table. The \"fair value of net assets acquired\" is $488,935 (thousands) which is $488.935 million. Then there's goodwill of $96,395 (thousands) which is $96.395 million. Adding those together: 488.935 + 96.395 = 585.33 million, which matches the purchase price of $585.3 million mentioned. So",

So, from that date, the next three years would be 2009, 2010, and 2011.\n\nLooking at the table, the numbers for those years are $1088 million for 2009, $1105 million for 2010, and $945 million for 2011. The question is asking for the total expected in the next three years, so I need to add those three amounts together. Let me check the numbers again to make sure I didn't mix up any years. The table lists 2009 as $1088, 2010 as $1105, 2011 as $945. Adding them up: 1088 + 1105 is 2193, plus 945 gives 3138. So the total would be $3,138 million. \n\nWait, the answer should be in millions, right? The table says \"fiscal (in millions)\", so the answer is $3,138 million. But the user might want it formatted as just the number with the unit. Let me confirm that the next three years after September 30, 2008, are indeed 2009, 2010, and 2011. Since the fiscal years are likely calendar years here, the next three years from 2008 would be 2009, 2010, 2011. So the calculation is correct.

          "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking for the total fair value of non-vested shares as of September 26, 2009. Let me look at the context provided.\n\nFirst, there's a table with different rows. The columns are \"non-vested shares\", \"number of shares\", and \"weighted-average grant-date fair value\". The last row in the table is labeled \"non-vested at september 26 2009\" with 2770 number of shares and $21.96 as the weighted-average grant-date fair value. \n\nSo, the total fair value would be the number of shares multiplied by the weighted-average fair value. Let me check the numbers. The number of shares is 2770, but since the context mentions that the numbers are in thousands, I need to remember to multiply by 1000. However, the answer should be in thousands as per the context's note. Wait, the problem says \"in thousands, except per share data\". The question is asking for the total fair value. So if the number of shares is 2770 (in thousands) and the fair value is $21.96 per share, then the total fair value would be 2770 * 21.96. \n\nLet me calculate that. 2770 * 21.96. Let me break it down. 2770 * 20 = 55,400. 2770 * 1.96 = let's see, 2770 * 2 = 5,540 minus 2770 * 0.04 = 110.8. So 5,540 - 110.8 = 5,429.2. Then total is 55,400 + 5,429.2 = 60,829.2. Since the numbers are in thousands, the total fair value would be $60,829.2 thousand. But the answer should probably be rounded to two decimal places as in the context. The weighted average is given as $21.96, so maybe the exact calculation is 2770 * 21.96. Let",

Let me go through the information step by step.\n\nFirst, the context mentions off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations as of May 28, 2017. It states that they have issued guarantees and comfort letters for both consolidated subsidiaries and non-consolidated affiliates. Specifically, $505 million for consolidated subsidiaries and $165 million for non-consolidated affiliates, mainly CPW. Then, it adds that off-balance sheet arrangements are generally limited to future payments under non-cancelable operating leases, which totaled $501 million as of the same date.\n\nNow, looking at the table provided, there's a row for operating leases (b) with total payments due of $500.7 million. That seems to align with the $501 million mentioned in the text. The other entries in the table like long-term debt, accrued interest, purchase obligations, etc., are part of contractual obligations but not necessarily off-balance sheet. The question specifically asks about off-balance sheet obligations.\n\nThe key here is understanding the difference between contractual obligations and off-balance sheet arrangements. The context says that off-balance sheet arrangements are \"generally limited to the future payments under non-cancelable operating leases,\" which is $501 million. However, the text also mentions the guarantees and comfort letters. But wait, are those considered off-balance sheet obligations?\n\nThe initial part of the context says they have issued guarantees and comfort letters totaling $505 million + $165 million = $670 million. But the question is about off-balance sheet obligations. The context then says that off-balance sheet arrangements are generally limited to operating leases. So maybe the guarantees are not considered off-balance sheet here? Or are they?\n\nWait, the first sentence says \"off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations...\" but then lists the guarantees. However, the next sentence clarifies that off-balance sheet arrangements are generally limited to operating leases. So perhaps the guarantees are part of contractual obligations but not off-balance sheet? Or maybe they are considered off-balance sheet?\n\nThis is a bit confusing. Let me check the definitions.

          "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the information provided in the table, the derivative losses for \"protect carrying values of excess inventories\" increased from $41 million in 2002 to $57 million in 2003.\n\nTo calculate the percentage increase:\n\nPercentage increase = (2003 value - 2002 value) / 2002 value * 100\n= ($57 million - $41 million) / $41 million * 100\n= 39.02%\n\nTherefore, the percentage increase in derivative losses for \"protect carrying values of excess inventories\" from 2002 to 2003 was 39.02%.",
          "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking by what percentage the \"protect carrying values of excess inventories\" increased from 2002 to 2003. Hmm. First, I need to find the numbers for that specific strategy in both years.\n\nLooking at the context provided, there's a table with different strategies and their values for 2003 and 2002. The row labeled \"protect carrying values of excess inventories\" shows \"-57 (57)\" for 2003 and \"-41 (41)\" for 2002. The numbers in parentheses are probably the absolute values, since they're showing losses as negative numbers. So, the losses in 2002 were $41 million and in 2003 they were $57 million.\n\nWait, the question is about the increase from 2002 to 2003. Since both are losses (negative numbers), but we're looking at the percentage increase. Let me make sure I'm interpreting this correctly. The actual values are negative, but when calculating percentage increase, we need to consider the absolute values or the actual numbers? Hmm.\n\nPercentage increase formula is ((New Value - Old Value)/Old Value) * 100. But since both are negative, let me check. If in 2002 it was -41 and in 2003 it's -57, then the difference is (-57 - (-41)) = -16. Divided by the old value (-41), so (-16)/(-41) = 0.3902, which is 39.02%. But wait, that would be a percentage increase in the loss. So the loss increased by 39%, which would mean the value went down more. But the question says \"increase\" in the protect carrying values. Wait, maybe the question is phrased as the absolute value of the loss increasing. So even though it's a larger negative number, the magnitude increased. So the percentage increase from 41 to 57. Let me recast it as positive numbers for calculation. So 41 to 57. The increase is 16. So (16/41)*100 = 39.02%, which rounds to 39%.",

          "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking for the average size of switching centers in 2017. The context provided has some data tables.\n\nLooking at the first part of the context, there's a table with properties as of December 31, 2017. The table lists different types of properties: switching centers, data centers, call centers, and warehouses. Each has an approximate number and size in square feet. \n\nFor switching centers, the approximate number is 61 and the approximate size is 1,300,000 square feet. The question is about the average size, so I need to divide the total size by the number of switching centers. \n\nSo, total size is 1,300,000 sq ft divided by 61 centers. Let me do that calculation. 1,300,000 divided by 61. Let me see, 61 times 21,000 is 1,281,000. Then there's 19,000 left. So approximately 21,311 square feet per switching center. Wait, maybe I should do the exact division. 1,300,000 \u00f7 61. Let me compute that. \n\n61 \u00d7 21,311 = 61 \u00d7 20,000 = 1,220,000; 61 \u00d7 1,311 = 61 \u00d7 1,300 = 79,300 and 61 \u00d7 11 = 671. So total is 1,220,000 + 79,300 = 1,299,300 + 671 = 1,299,971. That's very close to 1,300,000. So the average is approximately 21,311 square feet. But maybe the answer expects a rounded number.

When dealing with negative numbers, the percentage change can be tricky. Let me think again. The actual change is from -599 to -291. The difference is (-291) - (-599) = 308. The original value is -599. So 308 divided by -599 gives a negative percentage change, but since the amount is decreasing in negativity, maybe we should take absolute values?

I need to look through the provided context to find the relevant information.\n\nLooking at the context, there's a table that shows the reconciliation of the provision for income taxes. The rows include different factors affecting the tax provision, and the columns are for the years 2006, 2005 as restated, and 2004 as restated. \n\nIn the table, under the \"provision for income taxes\" row, the values are listed as $829 million for 2006, $480 million for 2005 as restated, and $104 million for 2004. The question is about 2005, so the number here is $480 million. \n\nI should check if there's any other mention of tax expense for 2005 elsewhere in the context, but the main table seems to directly answer the question. The note mentions that the 2005 numbers are restated, but the provision for income taxes is clearly stated as $480 million. \n\nAdditionally, the effective tax rate for 2005 is given as 27%, which aligns with the provision amount when considering the income before taxes. However, the exact tax expense is directly provided in the table. \n\nNo other sections mention a different figure for 2005 tax expense. The rest of the context discusses valuation allowances, tax benefits from stock options, and other details, but those don't pertain to the 2005 tax expense specifically. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be $480 million.\n</think>\n\nThe 2005 tax expense, as reported in the provision for income taxes row of the reconciliation table, is **$480 million**.

          "ground_truth_answer": "From the information provided, we can calculate the average share price for the shares issued to employees in the U.S. under the employee share purchase plan in 2015.\n\nThe relevant information is:\n- In 2015, 411,636 shares were issued to employees under the U.S. employee share purchase plan.\n- Compensation expense recognized for this plan in 2015 was $9 million.\n\nTo calculate the average share price, we can divide the compensation expense by the number of shares issued:\n\nAverage share price = Compensation expense / Number of shares issued\n= $9 million / 411,636 shares\n= $21.87 per share\n\nSo the average share price for the shares issued to employees in the U.S. under the employee share purchase plan in 2015 was $21.87.",

That amount relates to stock\u2011option exercises, not to the share\u2011purchase plan, so it cannot be used to calculate the average price of the 2,779 purchase\u2011plan shares.\n\nBecause the necessary numerator (total cash received for the 2,779 shares) is missing, the average share price for the shares issued to employees in 2015 cannot be determined from the provided context.\n\n*If one were to make a very rough, **non\u2011official** estimate by dividing the $40 (stock\u2011option cash) by the 2,779 shares, the result would be about $0.014 per share. However, this figure does **not** represent the actual purchase\u2011plan price and should not be treated as the answer.*\n\n**Conclusion:** The average share price for the 2,779 shares issued under the U.S. employee share purchase plan in 2015 cannot be calculated with the data given.
