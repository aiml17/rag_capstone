The total decrease in net revenue from 2011 to 2012 was $191 million.\n\nTo calculate the nuclear realized price changes as a percentage of the decrease in net revenue, we can use the following formula:\n\nPercentage = (Nuclear Realized Price Changes / Decrease in Net Revenue) x 100\n\nPlugging in the values:\nPercentage = (-$194 million / -$191 million) x 100\n            = (1.016) x 100\n            = 101.6%\n\nTherefore, the nuclear realized price changes accounted for 101.6% of the decrease in net revenue from 2011 to 2012.",
