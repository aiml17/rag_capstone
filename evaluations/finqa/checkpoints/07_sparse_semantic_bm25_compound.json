This can be calculated based on the provided information about the segment net sales for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2006. In 2008, the net sales were $12.099 billion, while in 2006 they were $28.383 billion. \n\nTo calculate the percentage difference:\n(28.383 - 12.099) / 28.383 * 100 = 57%\n\nTherefore, there was a 57% decrease in consolidated net sales from 2006 to 2008.",
