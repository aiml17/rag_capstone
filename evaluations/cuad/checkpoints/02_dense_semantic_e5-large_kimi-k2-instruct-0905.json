      "question": "Is a party\u2019s liability uncapped upon the breach of its obligation in the contract? This also includes uncap liability for a particular type of breach such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality obligation.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the context provided in the Cooperation Agreement, there does not appear to be any uncapped liability for a party's breach of the contract. The agreement does not explicitly state that a party's liability is uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.\n\nThe relevant sections are:\n\n1. Clause 5 on Confidential Information, which states that the obligations of confidentiality shall remain in force until the relevant information enters the public domain otherwise than by the default of a party. This suggests there is no uncapped liability for breach of the confidentiality obligation.\n\n2. Clause 4.1 regarding QIWI's obligation to settle transactions through Otkritie's bank. This clause states that if QIWI terminates this obligation, it shall pay a fee to Otkritie, but this fee is capped at RUB 50,000,000. This indicates a cap on liability for breach of this specific obligation.\n\n3. The agreement does not contain any other provisions that suggest uncapped liability for breach of the contract or specific types of breaches. The dispute resolution clause (Clause 9) also does not indicate uncapped damages.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the Cooperation Agreement, the liability of the parties does not appear to be uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.",

      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, the franchise agreement contains restrictions on the franchisee's ability to compete with Pretzel Time, both during the term of the franchise agreement and after its termination or expiration.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n1. During the term of the franchise agreement, the franchisee agrees that neither it, its affiliates, nor its owners will have any direct or indirect interest in a \"Competitive Business\" located at the franchise site, within 3 miles of the franchise unit, or within 3 miles of any other Pretzel Time unit in operation or under development (Section 21.A).\n\n2. After termination or expiration of the franchise agreement, the franchisee and its owners agree not to have any direct or indirect interest in a Competitive Business located at the franchise site, within 3 miles of the franchise unit, or within 3 miles of any other Pretzel Time unit in operation or under development for a period of 12 months (Section 20.G).\n\nThe agreement also restricts the franchisee from recruiting or hiring any employees who were employed by Pretzel Time or another Pretzel Time franchisee within the prior 6 months, without Pretzel Time's prior written permission (Section 21.A(2)).\n\nSo in summary, the franchise agreement imposes non-compete and non-solicitation restrictions on the franchisee both during the contract term and for a period after the contract ends.",
      "generated_response": "Yes.  \nDuring the term of the Franchise Agreement (and for any shorter period while the Unit is operated), the Franchisee and its affiliates/owners are prohibited from having any direct or indirect interest in, or performing services for, a Competitive Business located within three miles of any Pretzel Time Unit. They are also barred from recruiting or hiring any employee who worked for Pretzel Time or another Pretzel Time franchisee within the preceding six months, unless Pretzel Time gives prior written permission. These restrictions apply while the Agreement is in force; the clause does not impose a post-term non-solicitation of customers or partners, but the in-term prohibition on competitive activities and employee raiding is explicit.",

These clauses indicate that the Replacement Supplier, even though not an original contracting party, will have certain rights and obligations relevant to the termination of the agreement and the transfer of the maintenance services.\n\nFor example, Clause 18.2 states that \"DCL shall procure the transfer of the Management Services either from SEV to DCL or from SEV to any Replacement Supplier.\" This suggests that the Replacement Supplier can enforce its right to have the maintenance services transferred to it upon termination of the agreement.\n\nAdditionally, Clause 20 outlines the rights and obligations of DCL, SEV, and the Replacement Supplier in the event that the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations apply to the termination of the agreement.

Licensee is not granted any ownership rights in the Titles or the Licensor Marks (the logos, trademarks and service marks used to identify the Titles). Licensor only grants Licensee a non-exclusive license to use the Licensor Marks in connection with the Titles (Section 11).\n\n3.

The agreement states that Sections 2(a), 2(b), 2(c), 2(d), 3, and 11 shall survive the expiration or termination of the agreement (Section 7(c)).

Limitation of Liability: Section 12.2 states that \"IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING ANY LOST PROFITS, LOST REVENUES OR LOST SAVINGS, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT AND/OR THE PRODUCTS, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF THE PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED, KNOWS OR SHOULD KNOW, OR IS OTHERWISE AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\" This caps the liability to direct damages only.\n\n2. Time Limitation to Bring Claims: The contract does not explicitly state a time limitation for bringing claims. However, Section 14.3 states that if a party defaults or breaches the agreement, the non-defaulting party must give written notice and the defaulting party has 15 days to cure the breach before the agreement can be terminated. This suggests the parties have at least 15 days to bring a claim for breach before the agreement can be terminated.\n\n3. Maximum Recovery Amount: The contract does not specify a maximum recovery amount for damages. It only limits the types of damages that can be recovered (i.e. no indirect, special, incidental, etc. damages).\n\nIn summary, the contract includes a limitation on liability for certain types of damages, but does not explicitly state a time limitation for bringing claims or a maximum recovery amount.",

Ownership of Licensed Technology:\n   - Section 2.1 states that \"Subject to the rights granted to LICENSEE in this Agreement, D2 owns all right, title and interest in and to the Licensed Technology.\"\n   - LICENSEE is granted a license to use the Licensed Technology, but does not acquire ownership of it.\n\n2.

Source Code Access Conditions:\n   - Section 7.2 outlines certain \"Source Code Access Conditions\" under which LICENSEE can access the Licensed Source Code.\n   - However, even in these scenarios, LICENSEE does not acquire ownership of the Licensed Source Code. It can only use it for the purposes specified in Section 7.3.\n\nIn summary, the agreement does not transfer the intellectual property rights of the Licensed Technology from D2 to LICENSEE, either automatically or upon certain conditions being met.

Specifically:\n\nSection 3.2 states that the license grant back to SONY from PURCHASER is \"Subject to SONY's compliance with the covenant not to compete in Section 8.3 of Asset Purchase Agreement.\" This indicates that there is a non-compete obligation on SONY contained in the Asset Purchase Agreement.\n\nWithout seeing the full Asset Purchase Agreement, the exact scope of the non-compete is not clear. But this provision suggests that SONY has agreed to some limitations on its ability to compete with the business and products that were acquired by PURCHASER.\n\nSo in summary, yes there is a restriction on SONY's ability to compete with PURCHASER, though the specific terms of that restriction are not fully detailed in the Intellectual Property Agreement itself.",

Section 8.1 requires the consultant to promptly return all materials, property, documents, data, and other information belonging to the company upon termination.\n\n3. Section 9.7 on indemnification provides obligations that survive termination for a period of 3 years.\n\n4.

The indemnification provisions in Section VIII relate to losses arising from breaches or misrepresentations within the agreement itself.\n\nOverall, the agreement does not seem to restrict the parties from contesting intellectual property rights or bringing unrelated claims against each other.

The key points regarding intellectual property are:\n\n1. Confidentiality - The agreement requires both parties to maintain the confidentiality of each other's trade secrets and confidential information. This suggests the intellectual property remains the property of the originating party.\n\n2. Technology Licensing - The agreement states that UTEK will seek to acquire licenses to technologies on behalf of MKOS. This implies UTEK is acquiring the rights to the technology from third-party sources, not that MKOS is gaining ownership of UTEK's intellectual property.\n\n3. Termination - The agreement states that upon termination, any unvested shares of UTEK stock will be returned to MKOS. This again does not indicate a transfer of intellectual property rights.\n\nOverall, the agreement does not contain any provisions that would automatically transfer intellectual property created by one party to the other party, either through the terms of the contract or upon certain events occurring.
