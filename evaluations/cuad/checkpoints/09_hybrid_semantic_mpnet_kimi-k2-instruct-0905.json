      "question": "Is a party\u2019s liability uncapped upon the breach of its obligation in the contract? This also includes uncap liability for a particular type of breach such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality obligation.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the context provided in the Cooperation Agreement, there does not appear to be any uncapped liability for a party's breach of the contract. The agreement does not explicitly state that a party's liability is uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.\n\nThe relevant sections are:\n\n1. Clause 5 on Confidential Information, which states that the obligations of confidentiality shall remain in force until the relevant information enters the public domain otherwise than by the default of a party. This suggests there is no uncapped liability for breach of the confidentiality obligation.\n\n2. Clause 4.1 regarding QIWI's obligation to settle transactions through Otkritie's bank. This clause states that if QIWI terminates this obligation, it shall pay a fee to Otkritie, but this fee is capped at RUB 50,000,000. This indicates a cap on liability for breach of this specific obligation.\n\n3. The agreement does not contain any other provisions that suggest uncapped liability for breach of the contract or specific types of breaches. The dispute resolution clause (Clause 9) also does not indicate uncapped damages.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the Cooperation Agreement, the liability of the parties does not appear to be uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.",

No indemnifying party shall:\n\n(i) without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), settle or compromise or  consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which  indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim  or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising  out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding, or\n\n(ii) be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld),  but if settled with its written consent or if there be a final judgment of the plaintiff in any such action, the indemnifying party agrees to  indemnify and hold harmless any indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 shall for any reason be unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party  under Section 7(a), 7(b) or 7(c) in respect of any loss, claim, damage or liability, or any action in respect thereof, referred to therein, other than to  the extent that such indemnification is unavailable or insufficient due to a failure to provide prompt notice in accordance with Section 7(c), then  each indemnifying party shall, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party  as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof:\n\n24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(i) in such proportion as shall be appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Issuers on the one hand and the Remarketing  Agent on the other hand from the Remarketing; or\n\n(ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Issuers on the one hand and the Remarketing Agent on the  other with respect to the statements or omissions or alleged statements or alleged omissions which resulted in such loss, claim, damage or  liability (or action in respect thereof) as well as any other relevant equitable considerations."

      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the content license agreement, the intellectual property rights to the Titles do not become the property of the counterparty (Licensee). The key points are:\n\n1. Licensor grants Licensee a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the Titles, but Licensor retains ownership of the Titles (Section 2(a)).\n\n2. Licensee is not granted any ownership rights in the Titles or the Licensor Marks (the logos, trademarks and service marks used to identify the Titles). Licensor only grants Licensee a non-exclusive license to use the Licensor Marks in connection with the Titles (Section 11).\n\n3. There is no provision in the agreement that states the intellectual property rights to the Titles will transfer to the Licensee upon the occurrence of certain events. \n\n4.

Limitation of Liability: Section 12.2 states that \"IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING ANY LOST PROFITS, LOST REVENUES OR LOST SAVINGS, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT AND/OR THE PRODUCTS, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF THE PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED, KNOWS OR SHOULD KNOW, OR IS OTHERWISE AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\" This caps the liability to direct damages only.\n\n2. Time Limitation to Bring Claims: The contract does not explicitly state a time limitation for bringing claims. However, Section 14.3 states that if a party defaults or breaches the agreement, the non-defaulting party must give written notice and the defaulting party has 15 days to cure the breach before the agreement can be terminated. This suggests the parties have at least 15 days to bring a claim for breach before the agreement can be terminated.\n\n3.

      "ground_truth_answer": "No, the contract does not contain a license grant that is irrevocable or perpetual. The key evidence for this is:\n\n1. Section Ten of the agreement states that \"from and after the termination of the Contract Period, all of the rights of Company to the use of the name of the NFLA shall cease absolutely and Company subsequently shall not use or refer to the NFLA in advertising or promotion in any manner whatsoever.\"\n\n2. The contract defines the \"Contract Period\" to be a term of 3 years, from November 1, 2017 to November 2, 2020, unless terminated sooner or extended.\n\n3. There is no provision in the contract that indicates the license grant would continue beyond the Contract Period or be irrevocable. The agreement states the rights are granted to the company \"during the Contract Period\" only.\n\nTherefore, the license grant is limited to the 3-year Contract Period and is not irrevocable or perpetual based on the terms of the agreement.",

      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the information provided in the software license and maintenance agreement, the intellectual property created by one party (D2 Technologies) does not become the property of the counterparty (Summa Four Inc. or LICENSEE) either per the terms of the contract or upon the occurrence of certain events. \n\nThe key points are:\n\n1. Ownership of Licensed Technology:\n   - Section 2.1 states that \"Subject to the rights granted to LICENSEE in this Agreement, D2 owns all right, title and interest in and to the Licensed Technology.\"\n   - LICENSEE is granted a license to use the Licensed Technology, but does not acquire ownership of it.\n\n2.

Source Code Access Conditions:\n   - Section 7.2 outlines certain \"Source Code Access Conditions\" under which LICENSEE can access the Licensed Source Code.\n   - However, even in these scenarios, LICENSEE does not acquire ownership of the Licensed Source Code. It can only use it for the purposes specified in Section 7.3.\n\nIn summary, the agreement does not transfer the intellectual property rights of the Licensed Technology from D2 to LICENSEE, either automatically or upon certain conditions being met.

      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, there appears to be a restriction on SONY's ability to compete with PURCHASER (GSI Technology, Inc.). Specifically:\n\nSection 3.2 states that the license grant back to SONY from PURCHASER is \"Subject to SONY's compliance with the covenant not to compete in Section 8.3 of Asset Purchase Agreement.\" This indicates that there is a non-compete obligation on SONY contained in the Asset Purchase Agreement.\n\nWithout seeing the full Asset Purchase Agreement, the exact scope of the non-compete is not clear. But this provision suggests that SONY has agreed to some limitations on its ability to compete with the business and products that were acquired by PURCHASER.\n\nSo in summary, yes there is a restriction on SONY's ability to compete with PURCHASER, though the specific terms of that restriction are not fully detailed in the Intellectual Property Agreement itself.",

Section 8.1 requires the consultant to promptly return all materials, property, documents, data, and other information belonging to the company upon termination.\n\n3. Section 9.7 on indemnification provides obligations that survive termination for a period of 3 years.\n\n4. The Statement of Work indicates the initial 12-month term will automatically renew for an additional 12 months unless the agreement is terminated, suggesting ongoing obligations during any renewal period.\n\nSo in summary, yes, the agreement demonstrates that the parties have certain post-termination obligations, particularly around confidentiality, intellectual property, restrictive covenants, and indemnification. The agreement is structured to have key provisions survive beyond the termination or expiration of the overall consulting relationship.",

      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the information provided in the Strategic Alliance Agreement, there does not appear to be any explicit restriction on a party contesting the validity of the counterparty's ownership of intellectual property or bringing claims against the counterparty for matters unrelated to the contract.\n\nThe agreement is focused on the services UTEK will provide to MKOS in identifying technology acquisition opportunities, and the compensation and other terms related to that arrangement. The agreement does not contain any provisions that would prevent either party from challenging the other's intellectual property rights or bringing unrelated claims.\n\nThe confidentiality provisions in Section VII restrict the parties from divulging each other's trade secrets and confidential information obtained through the agreement, but this does not extend to broader challenges to ownership or unrelated claims. The indemnification provisions in Section VIII relate to losses arising from breaches or misrepresentations within the agreement itself.\n\nOverall, the agreement does not seem to restrict the parties from contesting intellectual property rights or bringing unrelated claims against each other. The focus is on governing the specific services and compensation arrangement outlined in the Strategic Alliance Agreement.",

The key points regarding intellectual property are:\n\n1. Confidentiality - The agreement requires both parties to maintain the confidentiality of each other's trade secrets and confidential information. This suggests the intellectual property remains the property of the originating party.\n\n2. Technology Licensing - The agreement states that UTEK will seek to acquire licenses to technologies on behalf of MKOS. This implies UTEK is acquiring the rights to the technology from third-party sources, not that MKOS is gaining ownership of UTEK's intellectual property.\n\n3. Termination - The agreement states that upon termination, any unvested shares of UTEK stock will be returned to MKOS. This again does not indicate a transfer of intellectual property rights.\n\nOverall, the agreement does not contain any provisions that would automatically transfer intellectual property created by one party to the other party, either through the terms of the contract or upon certain events occurring.
