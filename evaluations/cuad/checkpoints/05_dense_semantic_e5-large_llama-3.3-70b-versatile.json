      "question": "Is a party\u2019s liability uncapped upon the breach of its obligation in the contract? This also includes uncap liability for a particular type of breach such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality obligation.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the context provided in the Cooperation Agreement, there does not appear to be any uncapped liability for a party's breach of the contract. The agreement does not explicitly state that a party's liability is uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.\n\nThe relevant sections are:\n\n1. Clause 5 on Confidential Information, which states that the obligations of confidentiality shall remain in force until the relevant information enters the public domain otherwise than by the default of a party. This suggests there is no uncapped liability for breach of the confidentiality obligation.\n\n2. Clause 4.1 regarding QIWI's obligation to settle transactions through Otkritie's bank. This clause states that if QIWI terminates this obligation, it shall pay a fee to Otkritie, but this fee is capped at RUB 50,000,000. This indicates a cap on liability for breach of this specific obligation.\n\n3. The agreement does not contain any other provisions that suggest uncapped liability for breach of the contract or specific types of breaches. The dispute resolution clause (Clause 9) also does not indicate uncapped damages.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the Cooperation Agreement, the liability of the parties does not appear to be uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.",
      "generated_response": "The provided context does not explicitly state that a party's liability is uncapped upon breach of its obligations in the contract. However, it does outline specific obligations and potential consequences for breaches, particularly regarding confidentiality (Clause 5). \n\nFor instance, Clause 5.1 establishes a confidentiality obligation, and Clause 5.4 discusses the procedure in case an Affiliate is requested to disclose Confidential Information in litigation, suggesting that the disclosing party may disclose the portion of Confidential Information it is compelled to without liability under the Agreement. This implies some consideration for limiting liability in specific circumstances but does not provide a general statement on capped or uncapped liability for all types of breaches.\n\nGiven the information provided, it's not possible to definitively conclude that a party's liability is entirely uncapped for all breaches, including IP infringement or breach of confidentiality. The contract seems to handle different types of breaches and obligations with specific clauses, suggesting a nuanced approach to liability rather than a blanket statement on capped or uncapped liability. \n\nTherefore, without more explicit language regarding liability caps or the absence thereof across all potential breaches, the answer to whether a party's liability is uncapped cannot be conclusively determined from the provided context.",

According to the contract, during the term of the Franchise Agreement, or the period of time which Franchisee operates a Unit under this Agreement, whichever is shorter, neither Franchisee nor any Affiliate, immediate family member, or Owner thereof, shall:\n\n1.

These clauses indicate that the Replacement Supplier, even though not an original contracting party, will have certain rights and obligations relevant to the termination of the agreement and the transfer of the maintenance services.\n\nFor example, Clause 18.2 states that \"DCL shall procure the transfer of the Management Services either from SEV to DCL or from SEV to any Replacement Supplier.\" This suggests that the Replacement Supplier can enforce its right to have the maintenance services transferred to it upon termination of the agreement.\n\nAdditionally, Clause 20 outlines the rights and obligations of DCL, SEV, and the Replacement Supplier in the event that the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations apply to the termination of the agreement. This further indicates that the Replacement Supplier has enforceable rights under the contract.\n\nTherefore, based on the provisions in the contract, the Replacement Supplier appears to be a non-contracting party that can nonetheless enforce certain rights against the contracting parties, SEV and DCL.",

Licensee is not granted any ownership rights in the Titles or the Licensor Marks (the logos, trademarks and service marks used to identify the Titles). Licensor only grants Licensee a non-exclusive license to use the Licensor Marks in connection with the Titles (Section 11).\n\n3. There is no provision in the agreement that states the intellectual property rights to the Titles will transfer to the Licensee upon the occurrence of certain events. \n\n4. The agreement states that Sections 2(a), 2(b), 2(c), 2(d), 3, and 11 shall survive the expiration or termination of the agreement (Section 7(c)). This indicates the Licensor retains ownership of the intellectual property rights even after the agreement ends.\n\nSo in summary, the intellectual property rights to the Titles remain the property of the Licensor throughout the term of the agreement and beyond, and do not become the property of the Licensee under the terms of this contract.",

      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the context provided in the Cooperation Agreement, there does not appear to be any uncapped liability for a party's breach of the contract. The agreement does not explicitly state that a party's liability is uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.\n\nThe relevant sections are:\n\n1. Clause 5 on Confidential Information, which states that the obligations of confidentiality shall remain in force until the relevant information enters the public domain otherwise than by the default of a party. This suggests there is no uncapped liability for breach of the confidentiality obligation.\n\n2. Clause 4.1 regarding QIWI's obligation to settle transactions through Otkritie's bank. This clause states that if QIWI terminates this obligation, it shall pay a fee to Otkritie, but this fee is capped at RUB 50,000,000. This indicates a cap on liability for breach of this specific obligation.\n\n3. The agreement does not contain any other provisions that suggest uncapped liability for breach of the contract or specific types of breaches. The dispute resolution clause (Clause 9) also does not indicate uncapped damages.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the Cooperation Agreement, the liability of the parties does not appear to be uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.",
      "generated_response": "The provided context does not explicitly state that a party's liability is uncapped upon breach of its obligations in the contract. However, it does outline specific obligations and potential consequences for breaches, particularly regarding confidentiality (Clause 5). \n\nFor instance, Clause 5.1 establishes a confidentiality obligation, and Clause 5.4 discusses the steps a party must take if its Affiliate is compelled to disclose Confidential Information in litigation. While these clauses impose duties on the parties to maintain confidentiality and take steps to protect such information, they do not explicitly cap or uncapped liability for breaches of these obligations.\n\nGiven the information provided, it's not possible to definitively conclude that a party's liability is uncapped for all types of breaches, including IP infringement or breach of confidentiality obligations, as the contract's liability provisions are not fully detailed in the context. Typically, contracts specify the extent of liability, including whether it is capped, and under what circumstances, but such specifics are not provided here.

According to the contract, during the term of the Franchise Agreement, or the period of time which Franchisee operates a Unit under this Agreement, whichever is shorter, neither Franchisee nor any Affiliate, immediate family member, or Owner thereof, shall:\n\n1.

Franchisee  also  acknowledges  that Pretzel Time has granted the Franchise to  Franchisee  in  consideration  of and reliance  upon  Franchisee's agreement to deal  exclusively  with Pretzel Time.

      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the information provided in the Joint Venture Agreement, there does not appear to be any explicit restriction on the parties from contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty, either during the contract or after the contract ends.\n\nThe key relevant sections are:\n\n1. Duty of Loyalty (Section 44): This section states that the members can have interests in other businesses, provided they have the consent of the majority of the other members. It does not explicitly prohibit contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty.\n\n2. Confidentiality (Sections 45-46): These sections require the members to treat all matters relating to the agreement and the venture as confidential, and prohibit disclosure to third parties without prior written approval. However, this confidentiality provision is limited to a duration of one year after the expiration or termination of the agreement.\n\nThe agreement does not contain any non-compete, non-solicitation, or exclusivity clauses that would restrict the parties from contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty, either during the contract term or after it ends. The agreement appears to be focused on governing the joint venture relationship itself, rather than placing restrictions on the parties' external business activities.",

It does not mention non-solicitation or non-compete clauses that would restrict a party's ability to contract or solicit customers or partners of the other party.
