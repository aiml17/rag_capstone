      "question": "Is a party\u2019s liability uncapped upon the breach of its obligation in the contract? This also includes uncap liability for a particular type of breach such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality obligation.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the context provided in the Cooperation Agreement, there does not appear to be any uncapped liability for a party's breach of the contract. The agreement does not explicitly state that a party's liability is uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.\n\nThe relevant sections are:\n\n1. Clause 5 on Confidential Information, which states that the obligations of confidentiality shall remain in force until the relevant information enters the public domain otherwise than by the default of a party. This suggests there is no uncapped liability for breach of the confidentiality obligation.\n\n2. Clause 4.1 regarding QIWI's obligation to settle transactions through Otkritie's bank. This clause states that if QIWI terminates this obligation, it shall pay a fee to Otkritie, but this fee is capped at RUB 50,000,000. This indicates a cap on liability for breach of this specific obligation.\n\n3. The agreement does not contain any other provisions that suggest uncapped liability for breach of the contract or specific types of breaches. The dispute resolution clause (Clause 9) also does not indicate uncapped damages.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the Cooperation Agreement, the liability of the parties does not appear to be uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.",
      "generated_response": "Based on the excerpts you have supplied, the agreement contains **no clause that limits or caps a party\u2019s liability** for any breach \u2013 whether a general breach of its obligations, an infringement of intellectual\u2011property rights, a breach of the confidentiality provisions, or any other type of breach.\n\nThe relevant provisions that do appear are:\n\n* **Clause\u202f7.5\u20117.6** \u2013 dealing with assignment and third\u2011party rights, not liability.  \n* **Clause\u202f5.1\u20115.4** \u2013 setting out confidentiality obligations and the circumstances in which confidential information may be disclosed, but they do not contain any limitation\u2011of\u2011liability language.  \n* **Clause\u202f7.1\u20117.2** \u2013 dealing with partnership, authority and severability, again with no reference to liability caps.  \n* **Clause\u202f3.9** and **Clause\u202f8.5** \u2013 procedural matters (steering committee, service of documents).\n\nBecause the contract excerpts you provided do **not** include a \u201climitation of liability\u201d or \u201ccap on damages\u201d clause, the default legal position is that a party\u2019s liability is **not capped** by the agreement. Consequently, a party could be liable for the full extent of damages that a court (or arbitrator) determines are attributable to its breach \u2013 including damages for IP infringement, breach of confidentiality, or any other contractual breach \u2013 unless:\n\n1.

The provisions of Sections 3.6, 4, 6, 8, 9 and 11 shall survive any termination of the agreement (Section 10.8).\n\n2. Any contract entered into by the Parties with a Marketer for the Product shall survive termination of the agreement in accordance with its terms, including any renewal rights provided therein (Section 10.1). \n\n3. Upon any breach by CAPSUGEL, CARDAX shall be permitted to use all Intellectual Property of CAPSUGEL used in the Formulation and the Product to the extent necessary for the development and marketing of the Product (Section 10.2).\n\n4.

      "generated_response": "Yes.  The excerpt makes clear that the parties\u2019 duties do not simply end the moment the agreement is terminated or expires.

Other post\u2011termination duties (e.g., final payments, IP transfers, wind\u2011down or \u201clast\u2011buy\u201d commitments) would likewise be enforceable if they are set out elsewhere in the agreement, because the contract expressly preserves certain obligations beyond the termination date.",

      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, based on the information provided in the contract, there is a non-contracting party that is a beneficiary to some of the clauses and can therefore enforce its rights against a contracting party.\n\nSpecifically, the contract mentions \"Replacement Supplier\" in several clauses, such as Clauses 17, 18, 19, and 20. These clauses indicate that the Replacement Supplier, even though not an original contracting party, will have certain rights and obligations relevant to the termination of the agreement and the transfer of the maintenance services.\n\nFor example, Clause 18.2 states that \"DCL shall procure the transfer of the Management Services either from SEV to DCL or from SEV to any Replacement Supplier.\" This suggests that the Replacement Supplier can enforce its right to have the maintenance services transferred to it upon termination of the agreement.\n\nAdditionally, Clause 20 outlines the rights and obligations of DCL, SEV, and the Replacement Supplier in the event that the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations apply to the termination of the agreement. This further indicates that the Replacement Supplier has enforceable rights under the contract.\n\nTherefore, based on the provisions in the contract, the Replacement Supplier appears to be a non-contracting party that can nonetheless enforce certain rights against the contracting parties, SEV and DCL.",

The clause further clarifies that this exclusion does not affect any other rights or remedies a third party might have **apart** from the Act, but the context provides no indication of any such separate right.\n\nTherefore, under the terms of the contract, there is no non\u2011contracting party who can claim to be a beneficiary of the clauses and enforce rights against either party.

Licensee is not granted any ownership rights in the Titles or the Licensor Marks (the logos, trademarks and service marks used to identify the Titles).

There is no provision in the agreement that states the intellectual property rights to the Titles will transfer to the Licensee upon the occurrence of certain events. \n\n4. The agreement states that Sections 2(a), 2(b), 2(c), 2(d), 3, and 11 shall survive the expiration or termination of the agreement (Section 7(c)). This indicates the Licensor retains ownership of the intellectual property rights even after the agreement ends.\n\nSo in summary, the intellectual property rights to the Titles remain the property of the Licensor throughout the term of the agreement and beyond, and do not become the property of the Licensee under the terms of this contract.",

Section 10.4(b) specifically provides that neither party shall be liable for consequential, special, incidental or indirect damages, lost revenue or profits, etc., except in certain enumerated cases, such as a breach of the confidentiality obligations under Section 13.\n\nSo the agreement does not provide for uncapped liability upon breach.

      "question": "Does the contract include a cap on liability upon the breach of a party\u2019s obligation? This includes time limitation for the counterparty to bring claims or maximum amount for recovery.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, the contract includes provisions that limit liability upon breach of a party's obligations:\n\n1. Limitation of Liability: Section 12.2 states that \"IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING ANY LOST PROFITS, LOST REVENUES OR LOST SAVINGS, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT AND/OR THE PRODUCTS, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF THE PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED, KNOWS OR SHOULD KNOW, OR IS OTHERWISE AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\" This caps the liability to direct damages only.\n\n2. Time Limitation to Bring Claims: The contract does not explicitly state a time limitation for bringing claims. However, Section 14.3 states that if a party defaults or breaches the agreement, the non-defaulting party must give written notice and the defaulting party has 15 days to cure the breach before the agreement can be terminated. This suggests the parties have at least 15 days to bring a claim for breach before the agreement can be terminated.\n\n3. Maximum Recovery Amount: The contract does not specify a maximum recovery amount for damages. It only limits the types of damages that can be recovered (i.e. no indirect, special, incidental, etc. damages).\n\nIn summary, the contract includes a limitation on liability for certain types of damages, but does not explicitly state a time limitation for bringing claims or a maximum recovery amount.",

      "question": "Is a party subject to obligations after the termination or expiration of a contract, including any post-termination transition, payment, transfer of IP, wind-down, last-buy, or similar commitments?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the consulting agreement provided, there are several provisions that indicate the parties do have certain obligations that survive the termination or expiration of the agreement:\n\n1. Section 8.2 states that the obligations of Sections 3, 5, 6 and 7 shall survive any termination of the agreement. These sections cover key provisions such as:\n   - Independent contractor relationship (Section 3)\n   - Confidentiality and non-disclosure of proprietary information (Section 5) \n   - Ownership of intellectual property and work product (Section 6)\n   - Restrictive covenants like non-solicitation and non-competition (Section 7)\n\n2. Section 8.1 requires the consultant to promptly return all materials, property, documents, data, and other information belonging to the company upon termination.\n\n3. Section 9.7 on indemnification provides obligations that survive termination for a period of 3 years.\n\n4. The Statement of Work indicates the initial 12-month term will automatically renew for an additional 12 months unless the agreement is terminated, suggesting ongoing obligations during any renewal period.\n\nSo in summary, yes, the agreement demonstrates that the parties have certain post-termination obligations, particularly around confidentiality, intellectual property, restrictive covenants, and indemnification. The agreement is structured to have key provisions survive beyond the termination or expiration of the overall consulting relationship.",
      "generated_response": "Yes.  Under the agreement the parties remain bound by a number of post\u2011termination duties.  Section\u202f8.2 expressly states that the obligations set out in Sections\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f6 and\u202f7 survive any termination of the agreement, and that the provisions of Section\u202f8.2 itself continue to apply for three\u202fyears after termination.  In addition, the \u201cChange of Control\u201d provision creates a post\u2011termination payment obligation (a twelve\u2011month termination fee) if the consultant is terminated without cause within twelve\u202fmonths of the change\u2011of\u2011control event.  Consequently, even after the contract ends\u2014whether by death, bankruptcy, notice for cause, notice without cause, or mutual notice\u2014the parties are still required to honor the surviving obligations (e.g., transition services, IP transfer, wind\u2011down duties, payments, etc.) as specified in those surviving sections and for the three\u2011year survival period.",

Section 2 states that \"Provider agrees to allow us to prepay for our customers all set up, development, maintenance, and service fees associated with five thousand VISP websites for the customers of KCI at no charge to the customer.\" This indicates a specific quantity of 5,000 websites, but does not specify a minimum order.\n\n2. The contract does not contain any language about minimum purchase requirements or minimum order sizes. There are no clauses that obligate either party to purchase a certain minimum amount of services or products over any given time period.\n\nTherefore, the available information suggests there is no minimum order size or minimum amount/units per time period specified in this contract between YourNetPlus.com (the Provider) and Kingdom Connect, Inc.
