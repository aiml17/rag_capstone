      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the context provided in the Cooperation Agreement, there does not appear to be any uncapped liability for a party's breach of the contract. The agreement does not explicitly state that a party's liability is uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.\n\nThe relevant sections are:\n\n1. Clause 5 on Confidential Information, which states that the obligations of confidentiality shall remain in force until the relevant information enters the public domain otherwise than by the default of a party. This suggests there is no uncapped liability for breach of the confidentiality obligation.\n\n2. Clause 4.1 regarding QIWI's obligation to settle transactions through Otkritie's bank. This clause states that if QIWI terminates this obligation, it shall pay a fee to Otkritie, but this fee is capped at RUB 50,000,000. This indicates a cap on liability for breach of this specific obligation.\n\n3. The agreement does not contain any other provisions that suggest uncapped liability for breach of the contract or specific types of breaches. The dispute resolution clause (Clause 9) also does not indicate uncapped damages.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the Cooperation Agreement, the liability of the parties does not appear to be uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.",

      "generated_response": "Yes.  \nDuring the term of the Franchise Agreement (and for so long as the Franchisee operates a Unit), the Franchisee and its affiliates/family members are barred from having any interest in, or performing services for, a \u201cCompetitive Business\u201d located within three miles of any Pretzel Time Unit (\u00a71). In addition, for six months after an employee leaves Pretzel Time or any Pretzel Time Unit, the Franchisee may not recruit or hire that employee without Pretzel Time\u2019s prior written consent (\u00a72).

      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the content license agreement, the intellectual property rights to the Titles do not become the property of the counterparty (Licensee). The key points are:\n\n1. Licensor grants Licensee a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the Titles, but Licensor retains ownership of the Titles (Section 2(a)).\n\n2. Licensee is not granted any ownership rights in the Titles or the Licensor Marks (the logos, trademarks and service marks used to identify the Titles). Licensor only grants Licensee a non-exclusive license to use the Licensor Marks in connection with the Titles (Section 11).\n\n3. There is no provision in the agreement that states the intellectual property rights to the Titles will transfer to the Licensee upon the occurrence of certain events. \n\n4. The agreement states that Sections 2(a), 2(b), 2(c), 2(d), 3, and 11 shall survive the expiration or termination of the agreement (Section 7(c)). This indicates the Licensor retains ownership of the intellectual property rights even after the agreement ends.\n\nSo in summary, the intellectual property rights to the Titles remain the property of the Licensor throughout the term of the agreement and beyond, and do not become the property of the Licensee under the terms of this contract.",

      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the information provided in the software license and maintenance agreement, the intellectual property created by one party (D2 Technologies) does not become the property of the counterparty (Summa Four Inc. or LICENSEE) either per the terms of the contract or upon the occurrence of certain events. \n\nThe key points are:\n\n1. Ownership of Licensed Technology:\n   - Section 2.1 states that \"Subject to the rights granted to LICENSEE in this Agreement, D2 owns all right, title and interest in and to the Licensed Technology.\"\n   - LICENSEE is granted a license to use the Licensed Technology, but does not acquire ownership of it.\n\n2. Modifications by LICENSEE:\n   - Section 2.1 states that \"LICENSEE shall retain all right, title and interest in and to modifications to the Licensed Source Code made by LICENSEE pursuant to the license in Article 2.2 below, subject always to D2's ownership rights in the underlying Licensed Technology.\"\n   - This means that while LICENSEE can make modifications, the underlying Licensed Technology remains the property of D2.\n\n3. Source Code Access Conditions:\n   - Section 7.2 outlines certain \"Source Code Access Conditions\" under which LICENSEE can access the Licensed Source Code.\n   - However, even in these scenarios, LICENSEE does not acquire ownership of the Licensed Source Code. It can only use it for the purposes specified in Section 7.3.\n\nIn summary, the agreement does not transfer the intellectual property rights of the Licensed Technology from D2 to LICENSEE, either automatically or upon certain conditions being met. The Licensed Technology remains the property of D2 throughout the agreement.",

      "question": "Does intellectual property created\u00a0 by one party become the property of the counterparty, either per the terms of the contract or upon the occurrence of certain events?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the information provided in the Strategic Alliance Agreement, it does not appear that intellectual property created by one party automatically becomes the property of the counterparty, either per the terms of the contract or upon the occurrence of certain events.\n\nThe agreement does not contain any provisions that explicitly transfer intellectual property ownership from one party to the other. The key points regarding intellectual property are:\n\n1. Confidentiality - The agreement requires both parties to maintain the confidentiality of each other's trade secrets and confidential information. This suggests the intellectual property remains the property of the originating party.\n\n2. Technology Licensing - The agreement states that UTEK will seek to acquire licenses to technologies on behalf of MKOS. This implies UTEK is acquiring the rights to the technology from third-party sources, not that MKOS is gaining ownership of UTEK's intellectual property.\n\n3. Termination - The agreement states that upon termination, any unvested shares of UTEK stock will be returned to MKOS. This again does not indicate a transfer of intellectual property rights.\n\nOverall, the agreement does not contain any provisions that would automatically transfer intellectual property created by one party to the other party, either through the terms of the contract or upon certain events occurring. The intellectual property rights appear to remain with the originating party.",

        "The benefits of the Agreement shall inure to the respective successors and assignees of the parties and assigns and representatives, and the obligations and liabilities assumed in this Agreement by the parties hereto shall be binding upon their respective successors and assigns; provided that the rights and obligations of UTEK under this Agreement may not be assigned or delegated without the prior written consent of MKOS and any such purported assignment shall be null and void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, UTEK may assign this Agreement or any portion of its Compensation as outlined herein to its subsidiaries in its sole discretion.",

UTEK will then seek to provide a term sheet to MKOS outlining the consideration to be paid by MKOS for the acquisition of this technology. If MKOS executes the term sheet, agreeing to the terms set forth, UTEK shall transfer this subsidiary to MKOS in a stock for stock exchange under an \"Agreement and Plan of Acquisition.\" The consideration to be paid by MKOS to UTEK will be based upon a markup to the value of the license and other assets in the subsidiary as determined by UTEK and agreed to by both parties."

The closest relevant clause is Section 25.3, which states that upon the request of Bank of America, Supplier shall immediately remove any of Supplier's Representatives or Subcontractors performing services under this Agreement and replace such Representative or Subcontractor as soon as practicable. However, this clause is focused on Supplier replacing its own personnel at Bank of America's request, and does not restrict Bank of America from hiring those personnel.\n\nOverall, the agreement is silent on any restrictions related to hiring employees or contractors from the counterparty, either during or after the contract term. There does not appear to be a non-solicitation or non-compete clause in the agreement.",
