      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking about the duration of any warranty against defects or errors in technology, products, or services provided under the contract. The context provided is an amendment to a co-branding agreement between PC Quote, Inc. (PCQ) and A.B. Watley, Inc. (ABW). \n\nFirst, I need to check the context thoroughly. The amendment is about Section 2, Part B of the Co-Branding Agreement, specifically the Term. The document mentions the effective date as December 9, 1996, and the dates when the agreement was agreed to by the parties: Steven Malin on 12/5/96 and Howard Meltzer on 12/12/96. \n\nLooking through the provided text, there's a mention of the amendment applying to PCQ and ABW and their subsidiaries. However, the actual content of the amendment isn't detailed here. The user is asking about a warranty duration, which would typically be covered in a section about warranties, not necessarily in the Term section. \n\nSince the context only includes the amendment to the Term section, there's no explicit mention of warranties, defects, or errors in technology, products, or services. The Term section usually deals with the duration of the contract itself, not the warranties. Therefore, based on the provided information, there's no information about the warranty duration. The answer should indicate that the context doesn't provide details on warranty periods.\n</think>\n\nThe provided context does not specify the duration of any warranty against defects or errors in technology, products, or services under the contract. The text focuses on an amendment to the \"Term\" section of the Co-Branding Agreement, which likely relates to the agreement's duration or termination, but does not address warranty terms. Further details about warranties would require reviewing other sections of the full Co-Branding Agreement not included here. \n\n**Answer:** The context does not provide information about the duration of warranties for defects or errors in technology, products, or services.",

      "question": "Is a party\u2019s liability uncapped upon the breach of its obligation in the contract? This also includes uncap liability for a particular type of breach such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality obligation.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the context provided in the Cooperation Agreement, there does not appear to be any uncapped liability for a party's breach of the contract. The agreement does not explicitly state that a party's liability is uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.\n\nThe relevant sections are:\n\n1. Clause 5 on Confidential Information, which states that the obligations of confidentiality shall remain in force until the relevant information enters the public domain otherwise than by the default of a party. This suggests there is no uncapped liability for breach of the confidentiality obligation.\n\n2. Clause 4.1 regarding QIWI's obligation to settle transactions through Otkritie's bank. This clause states that if QIWI terminates this obligation, it shall pay a fee to Otkritie, but this fee is capped at RUB 50,000,000. This indicates a cap on liability for breach of this specific obligation.\n\n3. The agreement does not contain any other provisions that suggest uncapped liability for breach of the contract or specific types of breaches. The dispute resolution clause (Clause 9) also does not indicate uncapped damages.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the Cooperation Agreement, the liability of the parties does not appear to be uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether a party's liability is uncapped in case of a breach of the contract, including specific breaches like IP infringement or confidentiality. I need to look through the provided context to find any clauses that mention liability limits or exclusions.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the clauses. The context includes several sections: 7.5, 7.6, 7.1, 7.2, 5.1 to 5.4, and 9.11 to 9.9. The question is about liability, so maybe there's a clause in the contract that addresses this. However, looking through the provided context, I don't see any explicit mention of liability caps or exclusions. \n\nClauses 5.1 to 5.4 deal with confidentiality obligations and the circumstances under which disclosure is allowed. They specify the obligations but don't mention liability limits. Clauses 7.1 and 7.2 talk about non-assignment and severability. The arbitration and service of process clauses (9.6 to 9.9) discuss dispute resolution but not liability caps. \n\nSince there's no specific clause in the provided context that limits liability for breaches, including IP or confidentiality breaches, the default assumption would be that liability isn't capped unless stated otherwise. The absence of a liability cap clause means that the parties could be held fully liable for damages resulting from their breaches. Therefore, the answer would be that the liability is not capped as the contract doesn't include any provisions limiting liability for breaches.\n</think>\n\nThe provided context does not include any explicit clauses that cap or limit a party's liability for breaches of the contract, including specific breaches such as intellectual property (IP) infringement or breach of confidentiality obligations. The absence of such provisions in the text suggests that liability for these breaches is **not capped** by the terms of the agreement. \n\nKey points from the context:\n- **Confidentiality obligations** (Clause 5.1\u20135.4) outline permitted disclosures and duties to protect Confidential Information but do not mention liability limits.\n- **Dispute resolution** (Clause 9.6\u20139.9) focuses on arbitration and enforcement of awards but does not address liability caps.\n- **Severability** (Clause 7.2) ensures that invalid provisions are deleted without affecting the rest of the agreement but does not pertain to liability limits.\n\nIn",

      "question": "Is there a requirement for insurance that must be maintained by one party for the benefit of the counterparty?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, according to the General Provisions of the Sponsorship Agreement, the Sponsor (Rubio's Fresh Mexican Grill) must obtain and continuously maintain certain insurance policies for the benefit of the counterparty, SDBF (San Diego Ballpark Funding LLC):\n\nSpecifically, Section 8(c) states that Sponsor must obtain and continuously maintain the following insurance policies:\n\n1. Workers' Compensation insurance with minimum liability limits.\n\n2. An occurrence-based Commercial General Liability Insurance Policy with minimum liability limits.\n\nThe policies must name SDBF, Padres LP, the City of San Diego, and their subsidiary/affiliated companies and directors/officers/employees as Additional Insureds. The policies must also contain Cross Liability Endorsements and a Waiver of Subrogation in favor of SDBF.\n\nSponsor must provide SDBF with certificates of insurance evidencing compliance with these insurance requirements prior to the commencement of the sponsorship and annually prior to the expiration of each required insurance policy.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if there's a requirement for insurance that one party must maintain for the benefit of the counterparty. Let me look at the context provided.\n\nFirst, the context says all insurance policies must be issued by an admitted carrier with an A.M. Then, the sponsor has to obtain and maintain certain insurance policies at their own expense. The list includes Indemnity, Insurance, and Assumption of the Risk. Also, coverage for Additional Insureds applies on a primary basis regardless of other insurance. Plus, all policies need Cross Liability Endorsements or equivalents.\n\nSo, the key points here are that the sponsor is responsible for getting and keeping these policies. The mention of Additional Insureds suggests that these policies are for the benefit of others, possibly the counterparty. The Cross Liability Endorsements would handle situations where multiple parties are insured, so that if there's a claim, it's handled properly between them.\n\nThe question is whether there's a requirement for one party to maintain insurance for the counterparty's benefit. From the context, the sponsor must maintain insurance that includes Additional Insureds. That means the insurance isn't just for the sponsor's own benefit but also covers others, which would be the counterparty. The Cross Liability Endorsements ensure that if there's a liability issue, the policies work together correctly. \n\nSo yes, the sponsor is required to maintain insurance that benefits the counterparty (as Additional Insureds), and this is a mandatory requirement. The answer should confirm that there is such a requirement, citing the need for Additional Insureds and Cross Liability Endorsements.\n</think>\n\nYes, there is a requirement for insurance maintained by one party (the sponsor) for the benefit of the counterparty. The context specifies that the sponsor must obtain and maintain insurance policies that include **Additional Insureds**, which explicitly extend coverage to the counterparty. Furthermore, the requirement for **Cross Liability Endorsements** ensures that the policies address liability scenarios involving both parties, prioritizing the counterparty's coverage on a primary basis regardless of other insurance.

The user is asking about the renewal term after the initial term expires, including any automatic extensions or unilateral extensions with prior notice.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the provided context. The agreement is effective until March 18, 2021, unless terminated earlier by either party with 30 days written notice. The question is about the renewal term after the initial term. \n\nThe key part here is the termination clause. The agreement can be terminated by either party with 30 days written notice without cause. That means if either party wants to end the agreement before the initial term ends, they can do so by giving 30 days notice. However, the initial term itself is until March 18, 2021. The question is about what happens after that date. \n\nLooking through the context, there's no mention of an automatic renewal clause. The agreement states it's in effect until a specific date, and if not terminated, it would end on that date. There's no indication that the agreement renews automatically for another term. Also, there's no mention of unilateral extensions beyond the initial term. The only extension mentioned is the 30-day notice period for termination before the end date. \n\nSo, after the initial term expires on March 18, 2021, unless both parties agree to a new term or a renewal, the agreement would simply end. The context doesn't specify any automatic renewal or unilateral extension beyond the initial term. The 30-day notice applies to termination before the end date, not after. Therefore, the renewal term isn't specified here; the agreement just ends unless renewed through a new agreement.\n</think>\n\nThe context does not specify a renewal term after the initial term expires on March 18, 2021. The agreement allows for termination by either party with 30 days' written notice **before** the initial term ends but does not mention automatic extensions, unilateral extensions, or any provisions for renewal after the initial term. Thus, there is no explicit renewal term outlined in the provided text. \n\n**Answer:** The context does not state a renewal term after the initial expiration date of March 18, 2021.

It mentions that the Distributor gets a license to resell Airspan Products in the Territory. But it also states that there's no transfer of rights, title, or interest in the Airspan Software. So the license here is specifically for reselling the products, not for using the software.\n\nThen in section 21.3, there's a clause about assignment and subcontracting. It says that neither party can assign the agreement without the other's consent, but if it's to a subsidiary or affiliate, consent can't be unreasonably withheld. This might imply that the Distributor's affiliates could be involved, but it's about assignment of the agreement, not a license grant.\n\nSection 10.6 mentions that the Distributor doesn't get any rights beyond using the Confidential Information for the Agreement's purpose. So no additional licenses there.\n\nSection 21.12 talks about not publicizing the Agreement without consent, which isn't related to licensing.\n\nLooking at section 1.1 again, the Distributor's appointment includes a license to resell products. But the question is about a license grant to the licensee (Distributor) and their affiliates. The context doesn't explicitly mention affiliates of the Distributor being granted a license.

The key point is that the license is exclusive to the Distributor as an independent contractor, and there's no sublicensing unless through assignment with consent. But assignment isn't the same as a sublicense.

Distributor shall have no authority to accept any order or make any offer (except as herein stated), or execute any instrument or make any commitment on behalf of Airspan. Specifically, without in any way limiting the generality of the foregoing, Distributor agrees not to make any representation, guarantee, or warranty on Airspan's behalf concerning the Airspan Products, but will refer customers to Airspan's printed literature.

      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, based on the information provided in the agreement, there are certain obligations that continue after the termination or expiration of the contract:\n\n1. The provisions of Sections 3.6, 4, 6, 8, 9 and 11 shall survive any termination of the agreement (Section 10.8).\n\n2. Any contract entered into by the Parties with a Marketer for the Product shall survive termination of the agreement in accordance with its terms, including any renewal rights provided therein (Section 10.1). \n\n3. Upon any breach by CAPSUGEL, CARDAX shall be permitted to use all Intellectual Property of CAPSUGEL used in the Formulation and the Product to the extent necessary for the development and marketing of the Product (Section 10.2).\n\n4. Upon any breach by CARDAX, CAPSUGEL shall be permitted to use all Intellectual Property of CARDAX used in the Active Ingredient and the Product to the extent necessary for the development and marketing of the Product in accordance with the terms of the agreement as of the date of such termination (Section 10.2).\n\n5. Each Party shall return to the other Party or to the other Party's designee no later than thirty (30) days after the effective date of termination all of such other Party's property, including all proprietary information, in its possession, except to the extent required to be retained by law or to comply with such Party's continuing obligations (Section 10.7).\n\nSo in summary, yes there are certain post-termination obligations, including the survival of certain provisions, the continuing effect of third-party contracts, and the return of proprietary information and materials.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether a party has obligations after the termination or expiration of a contract, including things like post-termination transition, payments, IP transfer, wind-down, last-buy, etc. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the provided context. The context includes several sections from a contract, specifically under Section 10 about Term and Termination. \n\nStarting with the first paragraph before the sections: It says that upon termination, each party must return the other's property, including proprietary info, within 30 days, unless required by law or for continuing obligations. So that's a clear post-termination obligation regarding returning property.\n\nLooking at Section 10.1 Term and Renewal: It mentions that contracts with a Marketer for the Product survive termination according to their own terms. So any such contracts would still be in effect, which might include obligations like payments or other commitments.\n\nSection 10.3 Termination for Bankruptcy: If one party becomes bankrupt, the other can terminate. But does this affect other obligations? The section doesn't specify post-termination obligations beyond termination itself, but the general clause about returning property would still apply.\n\nSection 10.2 Termination for Breach: If a party breaches and doesn't cure, the agreement can be terminated. However, there's a mention of extending the cure period if the breaching party is diligently trying to fix it. This might relate to obligations during the cure period, but after termination, the standard obligations (like returning property) would still be in place.\n\nAlso, there's a part about ownership of Intellectual Property Rights. Each party owns their own inventions and IP made under the agreement. So if the contract terminates, there might be obligations related to transferring IP, depending on what was created. The context says each party owns their own IP unless otherwise stated. So unless there's an express clause about IP transfer, maybe there's no obligation, but the first paragraph says to return property, which could include IP materials.\n\nThe question also mentions \"post-termination transition, payment, transfer of IP, wind-down, last-buy, or similar commitments.\" The context's first paragraph covers returning property (which includes proprietary info), which is part of post-termination obligations. The survival of contracts with Marketers (10.1) implies that some payments or obligations under those contracts might continue. Also, the mention of \"continuing obligations hereunder",

The agreement does not mention any third-party beneficiaries who would have rights under the contract.\n\nThe only parties mentioned are Cisco, the Customer, and potentially Government end users who are granted a limited set of rights under the \"Government End User Purchasers\" clause. However, this clause does not appear to confer any enforceable rights to the Government end users beyond the rights already granted to the Customer.\n\nTherefore, the Software License Agreement appears to be solely between Cisco and the contracting Customer, and does not create any rights or ability to enforce the contract for any non-contracting third parties.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if there's a non-contracting party who is a beneficiary to some or all of the clauses in the contract and can enforce rights against a contracting party.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context to see if any clauses mention third parties. The context is a software license agreement from Cisco. Let me go through each section.\n\nThe first part talks about the agreement being the entire contract between the parties and that any void portions don't affect the rest. Then there's the disclaimer of warranty, which is standard. Next, it mentions that by downloading the software, you bind your business entity (Customer) to the agreement. If you don't agree, you can't use it and can get a refund. \n\nThen there's a part about Cisco and their accountants auditing the Customer's records to check compliance. If there's non-compliance, the Customer has to pay the fees. The disclaimer of liabilities is also mentioned.\n\nNow, looking for any third-party beneficiaries. The question is about non-contracting parties who can enforce the contract. The contract mentions \"Cisco, its suppliers and licensors\" in the disclaimer. But are these parties considered beneficiaries? The disclaimer says that Cisco and its suppliers/licensors disclaim warranties, but does that mean they have rights under the contract? \n\nThe audit clause allows Cisco to examine the Customer's records. That's a right Cisco has, but they are a contracting party. The disclaimer applies to Cisco and their suppliers/licensors. However, suppliers and licensors might not be contracting parties here. If the Customer is bound to the agreement by using the software, but the suppliers and licensors are not signatories, could they enforce any part of the contract? \n\nThe key part might be in the disclaimer where it says \"Cisco, its suppliers and licensors\" are disclaiming warranties. If a supplier or licensor is not a party to the contract, but they are mentioned in the disclaimer, does that make them a third-party beneficiary? Typically, third-party beneficiaries can enforce contract terms if the contract is intended to benefit them. However, in this case, the disclaimer is from Cisco on behalf of its suppliers and licensors. It might be that the suppliers and licensors are not intended to have enforceable rights here but are just being protected by Cisco's disclaimer. \n\nAnother angle: the audit clause allows Cisco to check compliance. If there's non-compliance, the Customer has",

      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the information provided in the Joint Venture Agreement, there does not appear to be any explicit restriction on the parties from contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty, either during the contract or after the contract ends.\n\nThe key relevant sections are:\n\n1. Duty of Loyalty (Section 44): This section states that the members can have interests in other businesses, provided they have the consent of the majority of the other members. It does not explicitly prohibit contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty.\n\n2. Confidentiality (Sections 45-46): These sections require the members to treat all matters relating to the agreement and the venture as confidential, and prohibit disclosure to third parties without prior written approval. However, this confidentiality provision is limited to a duration of one year after the expiration or termination of the agreement.\n\nThe agreement does not contain any non-compete, non-solicitation, or exclusivity clauses that would restrict the parties from contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty, either during the contract term or after it ends. The agreement appears to be focused on governing the joint venture relationship itself, rather than placing restrictions on the parties' external business activities.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether a party is restricted from contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty during or after the contract ends. I need to check the provided context for any clauses that mention non-compete, non-solicitation, or similar terms.\n\nLooking through the context first. The first paragraph says that members can have interests in other businesses as long as they have majority consent. It mentions that the Venture and other members don't have rights to those other businesses' assets or profits. So that's about other business interests but doesn't directly address soliciting customers or partners.\n\nNext, the context talks about what happens if a member goes bankrupt, withdraws, or has an operation of law. Then it mentions that the agreement can be executed in counterparts. \n\nThen there's a section about assigning proprietary assets and distribution rights. It says the assignment only includes economic rights and doesn't include management or voting rights. Assigning all rights would make the member lose their status. But again, not about soliciting customers.\n\nThe last part is about confidentiality, requiring all members to keep matters confidential without prior approval unless it's public.\n\nSo the question is about restrictions on contracting or soliciting customers or partners. The context doesn't mention non-compete clauses or non-solicitation agreements. The only restrictions are about confidentiality and not disclosing venture matters. There's no explicit restriction on a member from working with the counterparty's customers or partners, either during or after the contract. The members can have other business interests with majority consent, but that's about having interests in other businesses, not about soliciting customers.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided context, there's no restriction on contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty. The answer should be that the context doesn't address this, so the answer is no.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: The provided context does not explicitly restrict a party from contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty during or after the contract.

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out the answer based on the provided context. The question is asking about the category that includes exceptions or carveouts to Non-Compete, Exclusivity, and No-Solicit of Customers. However, the context given doesn't mention Non-Compete, Exclusivity, or No-Solicit clauses directly. Instead, it's about Third Party Agreements and Reservation of Rights in Section 5.8, and then goes into details about cross-licenses of software between SpinCo and RemainCo.\n\nLooking through the sections, there are provisions about licenses granted by each company to the other regarding their respective know-how. The key parts mention that these licenses don't extend to certain situations, like if licensing would breach an agreement with a third party or if the intellectual property isn't owned by the group. These seem like exceptions or carveouts to the licenses provided. \n\nThe question might be referring to these exceptions in the licensing agreements as the carveouts. The answer would likely be the sections where they specify that the licenses don't apply if there's a breach of third-party agreements or if the IP isn't owned. The exact wording in the context is under the \"provided, however, the foregoing licenses shall not extend to...\" parts. \n\nSince the user is asking for the category name, maybe the answer is \"Third Party Agreements; Reservation of Rights\" as mentioned in the section title. But the actual exceptions are detailed in the provisions under the licenses. Alternatively, the answer could be the specific exceptions listed in the \"provided, however...\" clauses. However, since the question is about the category that includes these exceptions, the section title might be the answer. But the user might be looking for the specific exceptions mentioned in the licenses, which are the two (i) and (ii) points under each license. \n\nWait, the question is about exceptions to Non-Compete, Exclusivity, and No-Solicit, but the context doesn't mention those terms. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here. The context is about licensing intellectual property, not non-compete clauses. Perhaps the user made a mistake in the question, or maybe the answer is in the Reservation of Rights section. Since the context's section is titled \"Third Party Agreements; Reservation of Rights,\" maybe that's the category. However, the actual exceptions are in the \"provided, however...\" parts. \n\nAlternatively, the answer might be the \"Reservation of Rights\"",

      "question": "Does the contract include a cap on liability upon the breach of a party\u2019s obligation? This includes time limitation for the counterparty to bring claims or maximum amount for recovery.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, the contract includes provisions that limit the liability of the parties upon a breach of the agreement:\n\n1. Section 14 states: \"It is agreed that no personal liability whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed on or otherwise be incurred by any Partner, agent, management official or employee of the Transporter or any director, officer or employee of any of the foregoing, for any obligation of the Transporter arising under this Agreement or for any claim based on such obligation and that the sole recourse of Shipper under this Agreement is limited to assets of the Transporter.\"\n\nThis provision limits the liability to only the assets of the Transporter, and explicitly states that no personal liability shall be attached to the Transporter's partners, agents, or employees.\n\n2. The contract does not appear to include any time limitations for the counterparty to bring claims or a maximum amount for recovery. The contract states that \"any controversy between the parties arising under this Agreement and not resolved by the parties shall be determined in accordance with the laws of the State of Michigan\", but does not specify any statute of limitations or damage caps.\n\nSo in summary, the contract includes a limitation of liability provision that restricts the recourse of the Shipper to only the assets of the Transporter, but does not appear to include any time limitations or maximum recovery amounts.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the contract includes a cap on liability when a party breaches their obligations. They also mention time limitations for claims or a maximum recovery amount.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context for any mentions of liability. The first section under \"OTHER PROVISIONS\" says that no personal liability shall attach to any Partner, agent, management official, or employee of the Transporter, and others. It states that the sole recourse for the Shipper is limited to the assets of the Transporter. \n\nSo, this seems to indicate that the liability is capped in the sense that individuals aren't personally liable, and the Shipper can only go after the Transporter's assets. But the question is about a cap on liability in terms of breach of obligations. The key part here is \"sole recourse... limited to assets of the Transporter.\" That suggests that the maximum recovery is the Transporter's assets, which acts as a cap. There's no mention of a specific monetary cap, but the limitation to the company's assets is a form of cap. \n\nLooking elsewhere in the context, under \"MISCELLANEOUS\" it talks about waivers not affecting future defaults, but that's about waivers, not liability caps. \"RATES\" and \"EFFECT ON PREVIOUS CONTRACTS\" don't mention liability. \"RELEASED CAPACITY\" is N/A. \n\nSo, based on the \"OTHER PROVISIONS\" section, the contract does limit liability to the Transporter's assets, which is a cap. There's no explicit time limit mentioned for bringing claims, though. The answer should note that there's a cap (limited to assets) but no time limit specified.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: Yes, the contract includes a cap on liability. Under the \"OTHER PROVISIONS\" section, it explicitly limits the Shipper's recourse to the assets of the Transporter, stating that no personal liability shall attach to any individual (e.g., partners, employees, directors) associated with the Transporter. This means the maximum recovery for any claim is restricted to the Transporter\u2019s assets, effectively capping liability.

Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Company shall be the sole and exclusive owner of the Policy.\" So right off the bat, it mentions that the Company is the sole owner. The key phrase here is \"sole and exclusive owner,\" which implies that there's no joint ownership here. \n\nThen, the rest of the context talks about other things like the Agreement inuring to the benefit of successors and assignees, execution by counterparts, no employment contract, and the Company's ability to amend the Agreement with certain restrictions. None of those sections mention anything about intellectual property beyond the ownership of the Policy. \n\nThe question specifically asks about intellectual property, but the context only refers to \"the Policy\" being owned by the Company. There's no mention of other intellectual property or joint ownership. The term \"Policy\" here might be a specific document or asset, not necessarily covering all IP. Since the clause explicitly states the Company's sole ownership of the Policy and there's no other IP-related clauses mentioned, it seems there's no joint ownership provision. \n\nSo the answer should be that there's no such clause. The ownership is solely with the Company, not shared.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: No, the provided context does not include a clause for joint or shared ownership of intellectual property. The Agreement explicitly states that the Company is the \"sole and exclusive owner of the Policy,\" with no indication of shared ownership rights between the parties.

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if there's a minimum order size or amount that one party has to buy from the other under the contract provided in the context.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the context carefully. The context includes several sections of the agreement. The first part talks about assignment and transfer of rights, then confidentiality, payment upon termination, survival of certain sections, and indemnity. \n\nLooking at each section: The assignment part says you can't transfer rights without consent, except in cases like mergers. The confidentiality section outlines how each party should handle the other's confidential info. Then there's a part about payment after termination, mentioning that the customer has to pay within 15 days. The survival clause lists which sections stay in effect after termination. There's also a part stating they aren't partners or agents. The indemnity section talks about eGain's liability for infringement claims.\n\nNow, the question is about a minimum order size or units per time period. I need to check if any part of the context mentions such requirements. The sections provided don't include any mention of minimum purchase obligations, minimum quantities, or time-based requirements. The payment terms are about unpaid fees upon termination, but not about ongoing minimums. The survival clauses also don't reference minimum orders. The indemnity and confidentiality sections are unrelated to purchase amounts. \n\nSince there's no mention of minimum order sizes or units in any of the provided sections, the answer would be that there isn't one specified here.

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out the answer to the question about the renewal term after the initial term expires. The user is asking about the automatic extensions and any unilateral extensions that require prior notice.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the context provided. The context mentions that the agreement starts on the Effective Date and lasts for one year. Then there's a condition about Sections 2 and 3 terminating if there's a breach or default by the Client or TrueLink. But the main part about renewal is probably in the next part.\n\nThe key sentence here is: \"This Agreement shall renew automatically thereafter for successive one year periods until terminated pursuant to Section 12 herein or unless either Client or TrueLink deliver to the other written notice of intent not to renew no later than thirty (30) days prior to the end of said year.\"\n\nSo breaking that down, after the initial one-year term, the agreement renews automatically for one-year periods. But either party can choose not to renew by giving 30 days' written notice before the end of the current term. That means the automatic renewal is for one year each time, but if they don't want to renew, they have to notify the other party 30 days in advance. There's no mention of unilateral extensions beyond that; it's either automatic renewal or termination with notice. Also, the termination is covered under Section 12, but the question is about renewal terms, so the main points are the automatic one-year renewals and the 30-day notice period.\n\nI should make sure there's no other part of the context that affects this. The other parts talk about the validity of the agreement and the term related to termination for cause (like breaches), but the renewal process is specifically outlined in the automatic renewal clause. The answer should focus on the automatic one-year renewals and the 30-day notice requirement.\n</think>\n\nThe renewal term after the initial one-year term expires is **automatic for successive one-year periods**, provided neither party provides written notice of intent not to renew. Specifically:  \n- The Agreement renews automatically for one-year terms unless either Client or TrueLink delivers written notice of non-renewal **at least 30 days prior to the end of the current term**.  \n- There are no unilateral extensions beyond this automatic renewal mechanism; termination requires compliance with the 30-day notice requirement.  \n\nThis is governed by the clause stating the Agreement renews \"",

The user is asking whether the contract includes a cap on liability when a party breaches their obligations, specifically looking for a time limit for the counterparty to bring claims or a maximum amount for recovery.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context. The context is from Article VII, which covers Limitation on Liability and Indemnification. \n\nStarting with section 7.1, there's a part about Force Majeure Events. If a party can't perform due to such events, they have to notify the other, and obligations are suspended. If the non-performance lasts more than a certain period (redacted as [**]), the unaffected party can terminate. But this is about suspension and termination, not a liability cap.\n\nThen there's a bolded statement: \"EXCEPT FOR [**], IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR [**], EVEN IF SUCH PARTY WAS ADVISED OR AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\" This seems like a limitation of liability clause. It says that except for something unspecified, neither party is liable for certain damages. The exact terms are redacted, but the structure suggests a cap or exclusion of liability.\n\nNext, in section 7.3(a)(iv), there's a mention of Conformis' liability per occurrence not exceeding the greater of $[**] or the insurance coverage paid. This is a clear cap on liability for Conformis in specific cases. The amounts are redacted, but the existence of a cap is there.\n\nLooking at section 7.2, it's about the process for addressing material breaches. It outlines steps for notice, remediation periods, and termination. However, this section doesn't mention a cap on liability. It's more about the procedure for handling breaches rather than limiting the amount of damages.\n\nPutting this together, the contract does have a cap on liability. The key parts are the bolded statement in 7.1 (which likely excludes certain damages) and the specific cap in 7.3(a)(iv) for Conformis. The answer should mention both the exclusion of certain damages and the specific monetary cap for Conformis.\n</think>\n\nThe contract includes a cap on liability for certain breaches.

The user is asking whether one party can terminate the agreement if there's a change of control, like a merger or asset sale, and if the other party needs to consent or be notified.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context. The key sections here are probably in the Termination and Survival section, which is section 13. Let me check section 13.3. \n\nIn 13.3, it says that either party can terminate immediately if the other party ceases to function as a going concern or stops normal operations. Then there's a part about a petition under bankruptcy laws. Also, if About sells all or substantially all of its assets, or if an entity acquires 50% of the voting stock, then the other party can terminate. But there's an exception: if About is acquired by Primedia, that's not a reason for termination. Similarly, if eBix is acquired by certain companies listed (like AOL, Yahoo, etc.), then About can terminate by giving written notice. \n\nSo, if there's a change of control event like a merger or asset sale, the other party (About or the other side) can terminate immediately upon written notice. For example, if eBix is acquired by any of the listed companies, About can terminate by notifying eBix. There's no mention of needing consent from the acquiring party; it's more about the existing party's right to terminate upon such an event. \n\nAlso, looking at section 15.6, assignments without consent are allowed to affiliates or successors via merger, etc., but the agreement remains binding. However, the termination clause in 13.3 seems to give the right to terminate if there's a change in control, depending on who is involved. \n\nSo the answer would be that if a party undergoes a change of control (like merger, asset sale, etc.), the other party has the right to terminate the agreement immediately upon providing written notice. There's no requirement for the counterparty's consent in such cases, except in specific exceptions like Primedia for About's acquisition. The key is that the termination right is triggered by the change of control event, and the affected party can act without needing the other's consent.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: Yes, under Section 13.3 of the Agreement, either party has the right to terminate the Agreement immediately upon written notice if",

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking about a category that includes exceptions or carveouts to Non-Compete, Exclusivity, and No-Solicit of Customers. The context provided is from a legal document, probably a separation agreement between two companies, given terms like Parent Group, SpinCo Field, and references to IP (Intellectual Property) and trademarks.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context for any sections that mention exceptions or carveouts related to those clauses. The question is pointing to a specific category in the document that serves as exceptions. The answer should be a term from the context that fits this description.\n\nLooking at the context, the sections listed are 1.7 to 1.10, 2.5, and 3.6. Let's break them down:\n\n1.7 \"Other IP\" defines intellectual property not part of Registrable IP owned by either party. Not directly related to Non-Compete or similar clauses.\n\n1.8 \"Parent Field\" defines the businesses of the Parent outside the SpinCo Field. This might relate to areas where the Parent operates, but not sure about exceptions.\n\n1.9 \"Parent IP Liabilities\" covers liabilities from the Parent's use of IP. Again, not about exceptions to Non-Compete.\n\n1.10 \"Parent Name and Parent Marks\" defines the trademarks and names used by the Parent. This could be relevant if there's an exception allowing use of certain marks, but the question is about exceptions to Non-Compete, etc.\n\n2.5 is \"Disclaimer of Representations and Warranties.\" This section usually states that the parties aren't making any warranties beyond what's specified, but not directly about exceptions to Non-Compete.\n\n3.6 \"Enforcement of Licensed IP\" (a) \"Control of Enforcement IP Actions.\" This might relate to who controls enforcement of IP rights, which could be a carveout if there's a provision allowing enforcement despite other restrictions. However, the question is about exceptions to Non-Compete, Exclusivity, and No-Solicit.\n\nWait, the user's question is about a category that includes exceptions or carveouts to those clauses. The answer is likely a section in the context that serves that purpose. But the provided context doesn't have a section explicitly titled \"Exceptions to Non-Compete...\" However, sometimes in legal documents, such exceptions are included in definitions or other sections.\n\nLooking again",

The question is about exceptions to Non-Compete, Exclusivity, and No-Solicit of Customers, but the context provided doesn't mention Non-Compete or Exclusivity directly.

Wait, the Non-Solicit clause says both parties agree not to hire employees of the other party who were directly involved in the services during the previous six months.

      "ground_truth_answer": "No, the contract does not contain a license grant by affiliates of the licensor or that includes intellectual property of affiliates of the licensor.

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the contract includes a license grant by affiliates of the licensor or intellectual property from those affiliates.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context. The context includes sections like Entire Agreement and Waiver, Indemnification, Injunctive Relief/Termination, and Non-Disclosure. The question is about a license grant involving affiliates or their IP.\n\nLooking at the \"Entire Agreement\" section, it mentions that prior software licenses between the parties are excepted. But the main agreement here is between MORPHO and XIMAGE. The Indemnification section talks about XIMAGE indemnifying MORPHO for third-party IP claims related to the Software. However, there's no mention of affiliates granting a license. \n\nThe Injunctive Relief section discusses termination for breach, but again, no mention of affiliates. The Non-Disclosure section is about keeping each other's confidential info private, but not about licensing. \n\nNowhere in the provided sections is there a clause where XIMAGE (the licensor) grants a license through its affiliates or includes IP from affiliates. The license mentioned is between XIMAGE and MORPHO directly. The question is about affiliates of the licensor (XIMAGE's affiliates), but the contract doesn't reference any such entities granting rights or their IP being part of the license. \n\nTherefore, based on the given context, the answer should be no. The contract doesn't contain a license grant by affiliates or their IP.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: No, the contract does not contain a license grant by affiliates of the licensor (XIMAGE) or include intellectual property of affiliates of the licensor. The agreement explicitly limits the license and indemnification obligations to XIMAGE itself and does not reference affiliates or their intellectual property.

There is no mention of any party granting a license to the other.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the contract contains a license granted by one party to the other. The user provided a context from a legal document, specifically an Addendum to a Distributor Agreement. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what a license in a contract typically entails. A license is usually a permission granted by one party (the licensor) to another (the licensee) to use certain intellectual property, like trademarks, patents, or copyrights. It's different from a distribution agreement, which is more about selling products.\n\nLooking at the context given, the main parties are Xplore, Zebra, and the Distributor. The Addendum is between Xplore and the Distributor. The key points are that Xplore agrees to sell Xplore Products to the Distributor under the terms of the Distributor Agreement. However, Xplore doesn't take on any obligations of Zebra except for selling the products. \n\nThe Distributor Agreement was originally between the Distributor and Zebra for Zebra's EVM products. After Zebra acquired Xplore, they added Xplore's products to their portfolio. The Addendum allows the Distributor to purchase Xplore Products from Xplore, which is now a Zebra affiliate. \n\nNow, the question is whether there's a license here. The document mentions that Xplore is the seller of Xplore Products, and the Distributor can purchase them for resale. There's no mention of granting a license to use intellectual property. The Distributor Agreement and Addendum are about distribution rights, not licensing. \n\nThe terms like \"sell\", \"purchase\", and \"resale\" indicate a sales relationship rather than a licensing arrangement. Also, the Addendum clarifies that Xplore is bound only for selling the products, not for any other obligations. There's no indication that the Distributor is given a right to use Xplore's IP beyond what's necessary for resale. \n\nTherefore, based on the provided context, the contract doesn't contain a license. It's a distribution agreement amendment allowing the Distributor to buy and resell Xplore Products, not a licensing agreement.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: No, the contract does not contain a license granted by one party to its counterparty. The Addendum establishes a sales relationship where Xplore agrees to sell Xplore Products to the Distributor under the terms of the Distributor Agreement. The Distrib",

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if there's a clause in the provided context that grants an \"enterprise,\" \"all you can eat,\" or unlimited usage license. First, I need to understand what these terms mean. An \"enterprise license\" typically allows a company to use software across all its departments, while \"all you can eat\" might refer to unlimited access or usage. An unlimited usage license would mean there's no cap on how much the party can use the service or product.\n\nLooking at the context provided, it's an amendment to a Supply and Manufacturing Agreement between Cerus Corporation and Porex Corporation. The key sections mentioned are changes to Section 1.3, adding Section 1.5.3, a new section 3a, and modifications to Exhibit D. \n\nIn Section 1.3, there's a mention of \"Porex Capacity Limitations\" which sets a maximum number of units that can be delivered in any given period.

There's no mention of unlimited services here.\n\nSection 3a is about Non-Production Related Work, which suggests that any work outside of production would be handled under specific agreements. The Pricing for Non-Production Related Work Orders in Exhibit D is added with mutual agreement, implying that pricing is set per agreement and not unlimited.\n\nThe key point here is looking for any language that would indicate unlimited usage.

      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the information provided in the software development agreement, the notice period required to terminate the agreement without cause is two weeks. \n\nSpecifically, Section 11.1 states:\n\n\"Either Party may terminate this Agreement at any time during the term of this Agreement for any reason upon two weeks written notice to the other Party.\"\n\nSo the agreement can be terminated without cause by either party with two weeks' written notice.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the notice period required to terminate renewal. Hmm, first I need to make sure I understand what \"terminate renewal\" means here. It might be a bit confusing. Termination usually refers to ending an agreement, while renewal is about extending it. So maybe they're asking about the notice period needed to terminate the agreement before it renews, or perhaps the notice period when ending a renewed agreement.\n\nLooking at the provided context, there are sections about termination. Let me scan through the sections again. The main termination sections are 11.1 and 11.2. \n\nSection 11.1 is about termination without cause. It says either party can terminate at any time during the term with two weeks' written notice. So if the agreement is in its term, regardless of renewal, terminating without cause would require two weeks' notice. \n\nThen there's 11.2 for termination for cause, which is immediate upon notice if certain conditions are met, like material breach or failure to pay. But the question is about the notice period for termination, not specifically for cause. \n\nThe user is asking about \"renewal,\" but the context doesn't explicitly mention a renewal clause. The term section says the agreement starts on the Effective Date and continues through completion or termination. There's no mention of automatic renewal, so maybe the termination notice applies when ending the agreement before it renews, but since there's no automatic renewal, the initial term's termination applies. \n\nSo the answer would be based on 11.1, which requires two weeks' written notice. The notice period is two weeks for termination without cause. Since the question is about the notice period for termination (which could be for renewal purposes if the parties decide not to renew, but the context doesn't specify a separate notice for non-renewal). In many contracts, the notice period for non-renewal is the same as termination without cause. Therefore, the answer is two weeks.\n</think>\n\nThe notice period required to terminate the agreement without cause is **two weeks** written notice to the other party, as outlined in Section 11.1 of the Agreement. This applies regardless of whether the termination occurs during the initial term or prior to renewal, as the context does not specify a separate notice period for non-renewal. \n\n**Answer:** The notice period required to terminate is two weeks' written notice",

I need to check the provided context for any mention of licensing.\n\nLooking through the context, there's a lot about amendments to a Supply and Manufacturing Agreement between Cerus and Porex. The sections mention things like Purchase Orders, Porex Capacity Limitations, invoicing, Statements of Work, and work orders. \n\nThe key parts here are about work orders and Statements of Work. The context says that Cerus can submit work orders for services not related to production, and Porex can accept them.

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the contract contains an irrevocable or perpetual license grant. I need to look through the provided context to find any mentions of such terms.\n\nFirst, I'll start by scanning the sections mentioned. The context includes several sections from the agreement between Supplier and Bank of America. Let me go through each relevant part.\n\nLooking at Section 5.5: It talks about licenses not terminating unless the Supplier terminates the Product License Schedule after Bank of America fails to pay. So termination here is conditional on non-payment, but the license itself isn't stated as perpetual unless terminated.\n\nSection 5.6 mentions termination for material default, allowing a refund. Also, termination for convenience regarding Maintenance Services. But again, these are termination clauses, not about the license being perpetual.\n\nSection 8.8 is interesting. It says that if a Release Condition occurs (like default or bankruptcy), Supplier grants Bank of America a nonexclusive, fully paid, irrevocable, royalty-free license to use the Source Code. The key term here is \"irrevocable.\" So this license can't be revoked once granted. That's a strong indicator of an irrevocable license under certain conditions.\n\nAlso, Section 5.9 lists surviving provisions, including \"LICENSE,\" which might mean that some license terms survive termination, but not necessarily making the license perpetual. However, the irrevocable license in 8.8 is granted under specific circumstances (Release Conditions), so it's conditional.\n\nThe question is whether the contract contains such a license. Since 8.8 explicitly states an irrevocable license upon occurrence of a Release Condition, that's a clear example. The license is perpetual in the sense that it's irrevocable once granted, but only under those conditions. So the answer should confirm that yes, there's an irrevocable license grant in Section 8.8.\n</think>\n\nThe contract contains an **irrevocable license grant** under specific conditions. Specifically, **Section 8.8** grants Bank of America a **nonexclusive, fully paid, irrevocable, royalty-free, worldwide license** to use, modify, and maintain the Software and Source Code if a \"Release Condition\" occurs (e.g., Supplier defaults, ceases maintenance, or Bank of America terminates the Agreement for cause). This license is explicitly **irrevocable** and perpetual in",

      "question": "Does one party have the right to terminate or is consent or notice required of the counterparty if such party undergoes a change of control, such as a merger, stock sale, transfer of all or substantially all of its assets or business, or assignment by operation of law?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the information provided in the sponsorship agreement, there does not appear to be any explicit provision that allows one party to unilaterally terminate the agreement in the event of a change of control of the other party, such as a merger, stock sale, transfer of assets, or assignment by operation of law.\n\nThe agreement states that it \"shall bind the parties, their respective heirs, personal representatives, successors and assigns.\" This suggests that the agreement is intended to remain in effect even if there is a change in ownership or control of one of the parties.\n\nAdditionally, the agreement states that \"This Agreement, or the rights granted under it, may not be assigned transferred or sublicense by either party without the express prior written consent of the other party.\" This indicates that any assignment or transfer of the agreement would require the consent of the other party.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, it does not appear that one party has the unilateral right to terminate the agreement due to a change of control of the other party. Consent or notice to the counterparty would likely be required for any such change.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether one party can terminate the agreement or if they need the other party's consent or notice if there's a change of control, like a merger or asset sale.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the provided context. The key sections here are the Assignment clause and the Binding Effect. The Assignment section says that neither party can assign, transfer, or sublicense their rights without the other's express prior written consent. Also, the provisions survive termination. The Binding Effect mentions that the agreement binds the parties and their successors and assigns.\n\nNow, the question is about a change of control scenario. Typically, in contracts, a change of control might trigger certain clauses. But in the given context, there's no explicit mention of a change of control. The Assignment clause requires consent for any assignment, but it doesn't say anything about termination. So if a party undergoes a change of control, like a merger, they might need the other party's consent to assign the agreement. However, the question is about termination rights. The context doesn't mention termination in the case of a change of control. The General Provisions talk about compliance with laws and good faith, but not termination. \n\nSo, based on the provided text, there's no provision that allows termination upon a change of control. The only requirement is prior written consent for assignment. Therefore, the answer would be that consent is required, but termination isn't mentioned. The user might be looking for whether termination is allowed without consent, but the context doesn't support that. Instead, the surviving party (after the change of control) would need to get consent to assign the agreement. If they can't get consent, maybe the agreement can't be assigned, but termination isn't specified here. So the answer is that consent is required for assignment, but there's no mention of termination rights in such cases.\n</think>\n\nThe context does not explicitly grant a party the right to terminate the Agreement solely due to a change of control (e.g., merger, asset sale, or assignment by operation of law). However, the **Assignment** clause prohibits either party from assigning, transferring, or sublicensing rights without the other party\u2019s **express prior written consent**. This consent requirement applies even in scenarios involving a change of control. \n\nWhile the Agreement\u2019s **Binding Effect** clause ensures obligations extend to successors and assigns, termination rights specifically tied to a change of control are not addressed in",

The context mentions several things: Party B has to maintain a professional attitude, prioritize Party A's benefits, and choose the most economical option while ensuring safety and reliability. There's also a part about modifications to the development plan and extra costs if Party A requests them. Additionally, it says that any other items not specified can be negotiated separately.

The user wants to know if the contract requires either Party A or B to have insurance for the other's benefit. Let me scan the context again for any mention of insurance.

The terms discussed are about professional attitude, benefits, economical options, extra costs from modifications, and handling unspecified items. Insurance isn't referenced here. The closest thing might be the part about safety and reliability, but that's about the services provided, not insurance coverage.\n\nSince the context doesn't include any clauses about insurance, the answer would be that there's no such requirement. The user might be checking if there's an implicit requirement, but based on the provided text, it's not there. They might need to look into other parts of the contract (like Article III mentioned) if there's a possibility insurance is covered there, but the context given doesn't include that.

      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, based on the information provided in the contract, there is a non-contracting party that is a beneficiary to some of the clauses and can therefore enforce its rights against a contracting party.\n\nSpecifically, the contract mentions \"Replacement Supplier\" in several clauses, such as Clauses 17, 18, 19, and 20. These clauses indicate that the Replacement Supplier, even though not an original contracting party, will have certain rights and obligations relevant to the termination of the agreement and the transfer of the maintenance services.\n\nFor example, Clause 18.2 states that \"DCL shall procure the transfer of the Management Services either from SEV to DCL or from SEV to any Replacement Supplier.\" This suggests that the Replacement Supplier can enforce its right to have the maintenance services transferred to it upon termination of the agreement.\n\nAdditionally, Clause 20 outlines the rights and obligations of DCL, SEV, and the Replacement Supplier in the event that the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations apply to the termination of the agreement. This further indicates that the Replacement Supplier has enforceable rights under the contract.\n\nTherefore, based on the provisions in the contract, the Replacement Supplier appears to be a non-contracting party that can nonetheless enforce certain rights against the contracting parties, SEV and DCL.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether a non-contracting party can be a beneficiary and enforce rights against a contracting party based on the provided context.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the context given. The first part mentions \"Third party rights\" and refers to the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999. The key point here is that a person not a party to the Agreement can't enforce any term under that Act. But it also says this doesn't affect any existing rights a third party might have outside of that Act.\n\nSo, the main clause here is that unless there's a specific provision allowing it, third parties can't enforce the contract terms. The answer would depend on whether the contract itself gives any third party the right to enforce terms. The context doesn't mention any such exceptions beyond the general statement that third parties can't enforce terms under the Act. \n\nLooking at other sections like Assignment and sub-contractors, there are clauses about SEV needing consent to subcontract and remaining responsible for their actions. But these don't grant rights to third parties to enforce contract terms. The other sections about representations, warranties, and liability also don't mention third-party enforcement.\n\nTherefore, based on the context provided, the answer would be no. The contract explicitly states that third parties can't enforce terms under the 1999 Act, and there's no indication of any other provisions allowing that. The only exception would be if there's a separate right outside the Act, but the context doesn't specify any such rights here.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: No, according to the provided context, a non-contracting party (third party) cannot enforce any terms of the Agreement under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999. The clause explicitly states that third parties have no right to enforce terms of the Agreement under this Act. While the context acknowledges that third parties may have rights or remedies \"apart from that Act,\" there is no indication in the provided text that such rights exist in this specific Agreement.

The key points are:\n\n1. Licensor grants Licensee a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the Titles, but Licensor retains ownership of the Titles (Section 2(a)).\n\n2. Licensee is not granted any ownership rights in the Titles or the Licensor Marks (the logos, trademarks and service marks used to identify the Titles). Licensor only grants Licensee a non-exclusive license to use the Licensor Marks in connection with the Titles (Section 11).\n\n3. There is no provision in the agreement that states the intellectual property rights to the Titles will transfer to the Licensee upon the occurrence of certain events. \n\n4. The agreement states that Sections 2(a), 2(b), 2(c), 2(d), 3, and 11 shall survive the expiration or termination of the agreement (Section 7(c)). This indicates the Licensor retains ownership of the intellectual property rights even after the agreement ends.\n\nSo in summary, the intellectual property rights to the Titles remain the property of the Licensor throughout the term of the agreement and beyond, and do not become the property of the Licensee under the terms of this contract.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether intellectual property created by one party becomes the property of the counterparty either under the contract terms or due to certain events. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context to see if there's any mention of IP ownership transfer. The context given is from a licensing agreement, specifically sections about assignment and indemnification. \n\nLooking at the assignment section, it says neither party can assign their rights without the other's consent, except under specific circumstances like assigning to affiliates or subsidiaries with consent, or in the case of a business sale.

Section 10.4(b) specifically provides that neither party shall be liable for consequential, special, incidental or indirect damages, lost revenue or profits, etc., except in certain enumerated cases, such as a breach of the confidentiality obligations under Section 13.\n\nSo the agreement does not provide for uncapped liability upon breach.

But otherwise, the parties' liability is subject to the caps and limitations outlined in Section 10.4.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether a party's liability is uncapped when they breach their contract obligations, specifically mentioning IP infringement or confidentiality breaches. The context provided is from a legal document about indemnification and limitations of liability.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the given context to find relevant sections. The key sections here are 10.1 and 10.4. \n\nIn section 10.1, there's a mention of the Manufacturer's liability in case of a Triggering Event. It states that the Manufacturer is liable for actual amounts the Customer has to pay to third parties due to their inability to supply products. However, there's a cap: the liability can't exceed the aggregate Conversion Cost Markup for the affected products in that fiscal year. So this shows that at least in this scenario, liability is capped.\n\nLooking at section 10.4, which is about Limitations on Liability, it's likely that there are general caps or exclusions. Even though the exact text isn't provided, the mention of \"Limitations on Liability\" suggests that the contract does impose some limits. Also, the answer provided in the example mentions that liability is capped under 10.1 and 10.4, so I should consider those.\n\nThe question also asks about specific breaches like IP infringement or confidentiality. The context doesn't explicitly mention these, but the general indemnification procedures in 10.3 require notice and evidence, and the limitations in 10.4 probably apply to all types of breaches unless specified otherwise. Since the example answer points out that 10.4 limits liability, it's safe to infer that even for IP or confidentiality breaches, the liability is capped unless the contract states otherwise.\n\nTherefore, the answer should state that liability is capped under the given sections, including for specific breaches, unless the contract provides otherwise. The example answer provided by the user aligns with this reasoning, so I need to confirm that the context supports this conclusion.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: No, a party\u2019s liability is not uncapped upon breach of obligations under this contract. The context explicitly limits liability in several ways:  \n1. **Section 10.1** caps the Manufacturer\u2019s liability for Triggering Events at the aggregate Conversion Cost Markup for affected Products in the relevant Fiscal Year.  \n2. **Section 10.4** (Limitations on Liability) further restricts liability,",

      "question": "Does the contract include a cap on liability upon the breach of a party\u2019s obligation? This includes time limitation for the counterparty to bring claims or maximum amount for recovery.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, the contract includes provisions that limit liability upon breach of a party's obligations:\n\n1. Limitation of Liability: Section 12.2 states that \"IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING ANY LOST PROFITS, LOST REVENUES OR LOST SAVINGS, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT AND/OR THE PRODUCTS, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF THE PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED, KNOWS OR SHOULD KNOW, OR IS OTHERWISE AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\" This caps the liability to direct damages only.\n\n2. Time Limitation to Bring Claims: The contract does not explicitly state a time limitation for bringing claims. However, Section 14.3 states that if a party defaults or breaches the agreement, the non-defaulting party must give written notice and the defaulting party has 15 days to cure the breach before the agreement can be terminated. This suggests the parties have at least 15 days to bring a claim for breach before the agreement can be terminated.\n\n3. Maximum Recovery Amount: The contract does not specify a maximum recovery amount for damages. It only limits the types of damages that can be recovered (i.e. no indirect, special, incidental, etc. damages).\n\nIn summary, the contract includes a limitation on liability for certain types of damages, but does not explicitly state a time limitation for bringing claims or a maximum recovery amount.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the contract includes a cap on liability when a party breaches their obligations. They also want to know if there's a time limit for the other party to bring claims or a maximum amount for recovery.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context for any mentions of liability caps. The context has sections about indemnity and liability, and expiry or termination. Let me start with the Indemnity and Liability section, specifically 12.1 and 12.2.\n\nIn 12.1, it talks about each party (Indemnitor) having to defend and indemnify the other (Indemnitee) against losses from certain claims, like breach of obligations, personal injury, or IP infringement. But there's no mention of a cap here. It's more about the scope of what's covered.\n\nThen in 12.2, there's a clause that says except for claims under 12.1, neither party is liable for indirect, special, incidental, exemplary, punitive, or consequential damages. This is important because it excludes certain types of damages, which could be seen as a limitation. However, the user is asking about a cap on liability, which might refer to a maximum monetary amount. The section here doesn't mention a specific monetary cap, just types of damages excluded. So maybe this isn't a cap in terms of a maximum amount, but rather a limitation on the kinds of damages recoverable.\n\nLooking further, the context also mentions that each party can seek injunctive relief for breaches related to Confidential Information and Intellectual Property Rights. But that's about remedies, not liability caps.\n\nIn the Expiry or Termination section (14.1-14.5), there's talk about termination for breach and cure periods, but nothing about liability caps. The termination clauses allow for ending the contract but don't set a maximum liability.\n\nAnother part to check is the \"No failure or delay...\" clause, which is about not waiving rights through non-exercise. Not relevant here.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The contract does limit liability by excluding certain types of damages (indirect, consequential, etc.) under 12.2. However, there's no explicit mention of a monetary cap or a maximum amount that can be claimed. The user's question also asks about time limitations for bringing claims. The context doesn't mention any",

The model end-user license agreement in Exhibit D states that the provisions in paragraphs 1 through 6 of that agreement shall survive the termination or expiration of the end-user license.\n\nSo even after the overall agreement terminates or expires, the parties remain subject to certain ongoing obligations, particularly around protecting the confidentiality and intellectual property rights related to the licensed technology.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether a party is subject to obligations after the termination or expiration of a contract, specifically mentioning post-termination transition, payment, transfer of IP, wind-down, last-buy, or similar commitments.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the provided context. The context is a legal agreement, so I should focus on the relevant sections. Let me scan through the text again.\n\nThe first paragraph mentions that the agreement is binding on the parties and their successors and assigns. It talks about assignment rights, allowing assignment to a successor or acquirer without consent. Then there's a part about the provisions of Article (paragraphs 1-6) surviving the termination or expiration of the Licensee's Customer Agreement. \n\nNext, there's a default clause: if a party defaults and doesn't correct it within 30 days, the nondefaulting party can terminate. Also, the Licensee can terminate with 90 days notice. \n\nThen there's a section about confidentiality, listing exceptions where the receiving party isn't liable for confidential info. Finally, sections 12.4 and 12.5 mention returning confidential info upon termination and the survival of confidentiality obligations for five years.\n\nThe question is about obligations after termination. The key part here is the survival clause. The context says that the provisions of the article (which includes confidentiality) survive termination for five years. Also, the return of confidential info is required upon expiration or termination. \n\nBut the question is broader, asking about any post-termination obligations like transition, payment, IP transfer, etc. The context doesn't explicitly mention those specific terms like transition, payment, IP transfer, wind-down, or last-buy. However, the survival clause in the context refers to the confidentiality provisions surviving. The other parts of the agreement (like termination for default) might imply some obligations, but the context provided doesn't detail other post-termination obligations beyond confidentiality and returning info.\n\nSo, based on the given context, the answer would be that yes, there are obligations after termination, specifically regarding confidentiality (surviving for five years) and returning confidential information. However, the context doesn't mention other obligations like payment, IP transfer, etc. But the user's question is whether the party is subject to obligations, and since the context does include some post-termination obligations (confidentiality and return of info), the answer would be yes, but limited to those mentioned",

The agreement is focused on the promotion and detailing of the specific product (BALVERSA) by Company on behalf of Janssen within the defined Territory. There are no provisions that would suggest either party has an unrestricted or unlimited license to use the other party's intellectual property or materials.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if there's a clause in the provided context that grants an \"enterprise,\" \"all you can eat,\" or unlimited usage license. First, I need to understand what those terms mean. An \"enterprise license\" typically allows a company to use software across all its departments, while \"all you can eat\" might refer to unlimited access. Unlimited usage license would mean no restrictions on the amount of use.\n\nLooking through the context provided, the main sections are about the relationship between the parties, restrictions on commercializing competing products, limitations on liability, and third-party rights. The first paragraph states that there's no partnership or joint venture, and they're independent contractors. Then there are clauses about not commercializing competing products without consent, and restrictions on comparing products. \n\nSection 12.3 talks about limitations on liability, capping damages. The last paragraph mentions that the agreement isn't enforceable by non-parties. Nowhere in the text do I see any mention of licensing terms, usage rights, or anything related to an enterprise license or unlimited usage. The focus is on restrictions and liability, not granting usage rights. \n\nThe user might be thinking that because there's a lot of legal language, there could be a hidden clause, but based on the provided context, there's no indication of such a license. The answer should be no, and I need to explain that the context doesn't include any such clauses.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: No, the provided context does not include a clause granting an \"enterprise,\" \"all you can eat,\" or unlimited usage license. The document outlines restrictions on commercializing competing products, limitations on liability, and prohibitions on product comparisons or disparagement.

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the notice period required to terminate the renewal of the contract. Let me look through the provided context to find the relevant section.\n\nFirst, I remember that the question is about termination notice for renewal, so I should check the Term and Termination sections. Looking at section 7, which is about the Term of the Agreement and Termination.\n\nIn 7.1, it says the Initial Term is 24 months and automatically extends for an additional half a year unless either party gives written notice of termination at least 60 days before the end of the period. So the key part here is \"unless either party provides the other party with written notification of termination of the letter Agreement at least 60 days prior to end of such period.\"\n\nThat means if a party wants to avoid the automatic renewal, they need to give 60 days' notice before the current term ends. The notice period here is 60 days. Let me double-check if there's any other mention of notice periods in termination clauses. Section 7.2 talks about termination for breach, but that's not relevant here. Section 7.3 is about terminating if a breach is anticipated, but again, the question is about terminating renewal. So 7.1 is the correct section. \n\nTherefore, the notice period required is 60 days. The answer should be 60 days.\n</think>\n\nThe notice period required to terminate the renewal of the agreement is **60 days**. This is specified in section 7.1, which states that either party must provide written notification of termination at least 60 days prior to the end of the current term to prevent automatic extension. \n\n**Answer:** 60 days.",

      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the information provided in the amendment to the Co-Branding Agreement, there is no explicit mention of a requirement on either party not to disparage the counterparty. The document focuses on amending Section 2 (Term) of the original Co-Branding Agreement between PC Quote, Inc. (PCQ) and A.B. Watley, Inc. (ABW). It does not contain any clauses related to non-disparagement or restrictions on how the parties can speak about each other. Without seeing the full original Co-Branding Agreement, there is no evidence in the provided context to indicate that there is a non-disparagement requirement between the parties.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if there's a requirement in the provided context that a party not disparage the counterparty. The context given includes an amendment to a co-branding agreement between PC Quote, Inc. (PCQ) and A.B. Watley, Inc. (ABW), dated December 9, 1996. The amendment is part of Section 2, Part B of the Co-Branding Agreement.\n\nFirst, I need to check the provided context for any mention of non-disparagement clauses. The context includes the amendment's application to PCQ and ABW and their subsidiaries. The main content of the amendment is about the Term, as indicated by the title \"Section 2 (titled 'Term'), Part B of the Co-Branding Agreement.\" The Term section usually deals with the duration of the agreement, not non-disparagement.\n\nLooking through the text, there's a mention of the amendment being effective December 9, 1996, and the signatures from both parties. However, there's no explicit language about non-disparagement. The user's question is specifically about a requirement not to disparage the counterparty, which is a common clause in contracts to prevent negative statements about each other.\n\nSince the provided context doesn't include any such clause in the amendment, and the rest of the document (as per the sources) is an S-1/A filing from 1999, which might include other sections but not this specific amendment's details, the answer would be that there's no requirement mentioned here. The amendment focuses on the Term, not on non-disparagement. Therefore, based solely on the given context, the answer is no.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: No, the provided context does not mention a requirement for either party to refrain from disparaging the counterparty. The amendment focuses on the \"Term\" of the Co-Branding Agreement and its applicability to subsidiaries but does not include language addressing non-disparagement.",

(the \"KCI\"). It does not contain language that grants a license to KCI or its affiliates to use the Provider's services or intellectual property.\n\nThe closest relevant clause is Section 8 \"ASSIGNMENT\", which states that the agreement can be assigned without prior consent to \"any person, partnership, firm or corporation affiliated by common ownership with the assigning party.\" However, this is in the context of allowing the parties to assign the agreement itself, not granting a license.\n\nOverall, the contract does not appear to contain an express license grant to KCI or its affiliates. The focus seems to be on the commercial relationship and obligations between the two parties, rather than any licensing of intellectual property or services.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the contract contains a license grant to a licensee and their affiliates. The user provided a context from a contract, and I need to analyze it based on the given sections.\n\nFirst, looking at the sections mentioned. The question is about a license grant to a licensee and their affiliates. The context includes sections 8 (Assignment), 10 (Severability), 4 (KCI's Responsibilities), 5 (Proprietary Information), and 9 (Entire Agreement). But the user is asking specifically about a license grant. \n\nSection 4 talks about KCI's responsibilities, mentioning \"Private Labeled Service\" and marketing it. It also says KCI and its officers, etc., must act in a professional manner. But does this imply a license? Maybe KCI is licensed to use the service to market it. However, the term \"license\" isn't explicitly used here. \n\nLooking at section 8, which is about Assignment. It mentions that rights and obligations can't be assigned without consent, except for affiliated entities. This might relate to sublicensing if the license can be assigned. But again, the license grant itself isn't in section 8. \n\nSection 5 is about Confidential Information, which is common in contracts but doesn't directly address licensing. \n\nSection 9 states that this is the entire agreement, superseding prior agreements. So any license terms would be in this agreement. \n\nWait, the user's question is about whether the contract contains a license grant. The context provided doesn't have a section explicitly titled \"License,\" but maybe it's in the sections mentioned. Let me check again. \n\nIn section 4, KCI is to market Private Labeled Service. The term \"Private Labeled Service\" suggests that KCI is using Provider's service under a license to offer it as their own. The phrase \"Licensee's Subscriber accounts\" in section 8 might indicate that there's a license involved. Also, in section 8, the mention of \"Licensee's Subscriber accounts\" implies that there's a licensee (KCI) who has subscribers, which would require a license from the Provider. \n\nSo even though the word \"license\" isn't used in the provided sections, the context implies that KCI (the Licensee) has a license to use the Provider's services to offer the Private Labeled Service. Additionally, the mention of \"authorized sub-license",

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether consent or notice is required if the contract is assigned to a third party. Let me look at the context provided.\n\nFirst, the context mentions that the Distributor can't assign the agreement without prior written consent from Tripath, and Tripath can assign it without needing the Distributor's consent. So, for the Distributor, consent is required. But Tripath is free to assign without consent. \n\nNow, the question is about a party assigning the contract to a third party. The answer depends on which party is doing the assigning. If it's the Distributor, they need Tripath's consent. If it's Tripath, they don't need consent. However, the question doesn't specify which party is assigning. But the general rule here is that the Distributor needs consent, and Tripath doesn't. \n\nAlso, the question is about whether consent or notice is required. The context doesn't mention a notice requirement for assignment. The key term here is \"prior written consent\" for the Distributor. So, the answer should state that the Distributor needs Tripath's consent, while Tripath can assign freely. Since the question is about a party (either one) assigning, the answer should cover both scenarios. \n\nWait, the user's question is phrased as \"if the contract is assigned to a third party,\" so they might be asking in general. The answer would be that if the Distributor wants to assign, they need consent. Tripath can assign without consent. So the answer is that consent is required if the Distributor is assigning, but not if Tripath is. Since the question is about a party (either side) assigning, the answer should mention both cases. \n\nAlso, check if there's any mention of notice. The context says \"prior written consent\" for the Distributor, but no notice requirement. The notice part is about how notices are sent (by receipted courier), but that's separate from assignment. So the answer is about consent, not notice. So the answer is that the Distributor needs consent, Tripath doesn't. Therefore, the answer is yes, consent is required if the Distributor assigns, but not if Tripath does.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: Yes, consent is required if the Distributor assigns the contract to a third party.

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if there's a clause in the provided context that mentions joint or shared ownership of intellectual property between the parties.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the given context. The first part talks about ownership being subject to restrictions, and assignments needing consent except in cases like mergers. Then it mentions they're independent contractors and not partners, agents, or joint ventures. \n\nThen there's a part labeled \"ii)\" which says if the agreement expires or is terminated (except under a specific section), the parties continue to jointly own Payment-Eligible User Data according to Section 6.a. \n\nSo, the key part here is the mention of \"jointly own Payment-Eligible User Data.\" That seems to be a shared ownership clause, but it's conditional on the agreement expiring or being terminated under certain circumstances. However, the user is asking about intellectual property in general. The term \"Payment-Eligible User Data\" might be a specific type of IP or data. \n\nThe context doesn't explicitly mention intellectual property in the ownership clause. The joint ownership is specified for \"Payment-Eligible User Data,\" which could be a subset of IP or a different category. The question is whether this counts as a clause about IP ownership. \n\nSince the answer depends on whether \"Payment-Eligible User Data\" is considered intellectual property, and the context doesn't clarify that, but the question is about IP ownership. The provided text does have a clause about joint ownership, but it's limited to that specific data type. The user might be looking for a general IP ownership clause, but the context only mentions this specific case. \n\nTherefore, the answer should note that there is a clause regarding joint ownership of Payment-Eligible User Data under certain termination conditions, but it's not a general IP ownership clause. However, since the question is whether there's any clause providing for joint ownership, the answer would be yes, but with the caveat that it's specific to that data type and under specific circumstances.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: Yes, there is a clause addressing joint ownership of specific data. The agreement states that if the Agreement expires or is terminated for any reason other than termination under Section 16.a.v, the parties shall \"continue to jointly own Payment-Eligible User Data in accordance with Section 6.a.\" However, this joint ownership is conditional on termination or expiration of the Agreement",

      "ground_truth_answer": "No, the contract does not contain a license grant that is irrevocable or perpetual. The key evidence for this is:\n\n1. Section Ten of the agreement states that \"from and after the termination of the Contract Period, all of the rights of Company to the use of the name of the NFLA shall cease absolutely and Company subsequently shall not use or refer to the NFLA in advertising or promotion in any manner whatsoever.\"\n\n2. The contract defines the \"Contract Period\" to be a term of 3 years, from November 1, 2017 to November 2, 2020, unless terminated sooner or extended.\n\n3. There is no provision in the contract that indicates the license grant would continue beyond the Contract Period or be irrevocable. The agreement states the rights are granted to the company \"during the Contract Period\" only.\n\nTherefore, the license grant is limited to the 3-year Contract Period and is not irrevocable or perpetual based on the terms of the agreement.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the contract has an irrevocable or perpetual license grant. I need to check the provided context for any mention of license terms.\n\nLooking through the context, the main points are about the Contract Period, which is three years from November 1, 2017, to November 2, 2020. It mentions that the contract can be terminated sooner or extended as per the agreement. The Contract Year is defined as each 12-month period starting from the effective date.\n\nThen there's a part about the company continuing to produce and market Licensed Products in the same manner as of September 2017, unless it's not commercially reasonable. Also, if they haven't disposed of all Licensed Products within 90 days, they can either remove NFLA references or destroy them.\n\nNow, the key here is whether the license is irrevocable or perpetual. The contract period is clearly set for three years with possible termination or extension. The terms don't mention anything about the license being irrevocable. The company's obligations are tied to the Contract Period, and after expiration, there's a process for handling remaining products. Since the contract can be terminated and has an end date, the license isn't perpetual. Also, the obligation to produce and market is conditional on commercial reasonableness, which implies it's not a permanent grant. So, the answer should be no, the license isn't irrevocable or perpetual.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: No, the contract does not contain a license grant that is irrevocable or perpetual. The license is tied to the \"Contract Period\" (November 1, 2017, to November 2, 2020), which can be terminated earlier or extended as specified. The obligation to produce and market Licensed Products is conditional on commercial reasonableness and ceases upon contract expiration or termination.

The given context is about the execution of the agreement in counterparts and the signatories.

      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the information provided in the software license and maintenance agreement, the intellectual property created by one party (D2 Technologies) does not become the property of the counterparty (Summa Four Inc. or LICENSEE) either per the terms of the contract or upon the occurrence of certain events. \n\nThe key points are:\n\n1. Ownership of Licensed Technology:\n   - Section 2.1 states that \"Subject to the rights granted to LICENSEE in this Agreement, D2 owns all right, title and interest in and to the Licensed Technology.\"\n   - LICENSEE is granted a license to use the Licensed Technology, but does not acquire ownership of it.\n\n2.

Source Code Access Conditions:\n   - Section 7.2 outlines certain \"Source Code Access Conditions\" under which LICENSEE can access the Licensed Source Code.\n   - However, even in these scenarios, LICENSEE does not acquire ownership of the Licensed Source Code. It can only use it for the purposes specified in Section 7.3.\n\nIn summary, the agreement does not transfer the intellectual property rights of the Licensed Technology from D2 to LICENSEE, either automatically or upon certain conditions being met. The Licensed Technology remains the property of D2 throughout the agreement.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out the answer to this question. The question is asking whether intellectual property created by one party becomes the property of the other party either under the contract terms or certain events.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context. The context is a software license agreement between D2 and the Licensee. Let me scan through the sections mentioned.\n\nLooking at the ownership sections. In 2.1 Ownership, it says that D2 owns all rights to the Licensed Technology. But the Licensee retains rights to modifications they make to the Licensed Source Code, as per Article 2.2. So, if the Licensee modifies the source code, they own those modifications, but D2 still owns the underlying Licensed Technology. \n\nAlso, in the context of the license, the Licensee gets a perpetual non-exclusive license to use the Licensed Technology in Object Code format. They can modify and create derivatives, but that's under the license terms. The Licensee's modifications are their own, but subject to D2's ownership of the original tech.\n\nThe question is about whether IP created by one party becomes the other's. So, for example, if D2 creates something, does it become the Licensee's? Or vice versa? \n\nFrom 2.1, D2 retains ownership of the Licensed Technology. The Licensee only owns modifications they make. So if the Licensee creates new IP based on D2's tech, they own the modifications but not the original. \n\nAlso, in the indemnification part, D2 is responsible for their own IP, and the Licensee isn't liable for D2's IP. If the Licensee modifies the tech, they can be liable for those modifications. \n\nSo, the answer would be that generally, each party retains ownership of their own IP. However, the Licensee can own modifications they make to the Licensed Technology, but only as specified in the contract. There's no clause that says that any IP created by one party automatically becomes the other's unless under specific terms, like the Licensee's modifications. \n\nSo the answer is no, unless specific terms in the contract (like the Licensee's right to own modifications) apply. Otherwise, each party keeps their own IP. The contract doesn't transfer ownership of new IP created by either party except as specified.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: No, intellectual property created by one party does not automatically become the property of the counterparty under the",

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking about the two or more parties who signed the contract based on the provided context. The context given is from a legal document, specifically under sections related to the Relationship of the Parties/Indemnification and Security Agreement.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the context to identify the parties involved. The first part mentions \"PRINCIPAL OWNER, OTHER OWNERS, DESIGNATED PRINCIPAL OWNERS, UNIT AND MANAGER, SUPERVISING OWNERS AND INITIAL CAPITALIZATION.\" These terms suggest different roles or entities involved in the agreement. The \"PRINCIPAL OWNER\" is likely the main party, while \"OTHER OWNERS\" and \"DESIGNATED PRINCIPAL OWNERS\" could be additional stakeholders. The \"UNIT AND MANAGER\" might refer to a unit (like a business unit) and its manager. \"SUPERVISING OWNERS\" could be oversight figures, and \"INITIAL CAPITALIZATION\" might relate to the initial funding or capital structure.\n\nThen, under the \"OWNER'S AND GUARANTOR'S UNDERTAKING AND ASSUMPTION OF OBLIGATIONS\" section, \"OWNER\" and \"GUARANTOR\" are mentioned. The \"GUARANTOR\" is a party that guarantees the performance of obligations by another party, typically the owner. The \"SECURITY AGREEMENT\" section implies that there's a security interest involved, which usually involves a debtor and a secured party. \n\nPutting this together, the parties involved are likely the Principal Owner(s), Other Owners, Designated Principal Owners, Manager, Supervising Owners, Owner, Guarantor, and possibly the Unit. However, the exact number and names depend on how these terms are defined in the full contract. Since the context is a snippet, I need to infer based on standard legal terminology. The key parties here are the Owner(s) and the Guarantor, as they are explicitly mentioned in the sections provided. The other terms like Principal Owner and Supervising Owners might be subsets or specific roles within the Owner group. \n\nThe answer should list the distinct parties mentioned. The main ones are the Owner and Guarantor, but the context also includes Principal Owner, Other Owners, etc. However, the question is about the two or more parties who signed the contract. Since the sections mention \"OWNER'S AND GUARANTOR'S UNDERTAKING,\" it's safe to include Owner and Guarantor",

      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, the contract includes a cap on liability for breach of a party's obligations. Specifically:\n\nSection 20 \"Limitation of Liability\" states:\n\na) Neither party will have liability for any damages other than direct damages. In no event will either party be liable to the other for any special, incidental or consequential damages, whether based on breach of contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise, whether or not that party has been advised of the possibility of such damage.\n\nb) Either party's liability for damages shall be limited to the amounts actually paid by the other party.\n\nSo the contract limits the parties' liability to only direct damages, and caps the maximum recovery at the amounts actually paid by the other party. There is no time limitation specified for bringing claims.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the contract includes a cap on liability when a party breaches their obligations. They also mention whether there's a time limit for the other party to bring claims or a maximum recovery amount.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context. The context is under the \"LIMITATION OF LIABILITY\" section. Let me read through that again.\n\nThe first part says that neither party is liable for damages other than direct damages. So, they can't be held responsible for special, incidental, or consequential damages, regardless of the reason\u2014like breach of contract or tort. That seems like a cap because it limits the types of damages recoverable.\n\nThen part b) states that either party's liability for damages is limited to the amounts actually paid by the other party. So, the maximum amount they can be held liable for is what the other party paid them. That definitely sounds like a cap on the maximum recovery amount.\n\nAlso, there's a mention of excusing delays or failures due to occurrences beyond reasonable control, like acts of God or government restrictions. But that's more about excusing performance rather than liability caps.\n\nLooking at other sections referenced in the context, like Section 20 (Limitation of Liability), which is part of the surviving provisions upon termination. But the key points are in the Limitation of Liability section itself.\n\nThe user is asking specifically about a cap on liability. The answer would need to confirm that there's a cap, which is the amount paid by the other party. Also, there's no mention of a time limit for bringing claims here. The Limitation of Liability section doesn't specify a time frame for claims. The time limit mentioned in the context is under part ii) of Section 19, which is about paying outstanding amounts within 30 days after termination. That's about payment deadlines, not claims.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The contract does have a cap on liability, which is the amount actually paid by the other party. There's no mention of a time limit for bringing claims in the Limitation of Liability section. Therefore, the answer should state that there's a cap (maximum amount being the amount paid) but no time limitation specified for claims in this section.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: Yes, the contract includes a cap on liability for breach of obligations.

But this provision suggests that SONY has agreed to some limitations on its ability to compete with the business and products that were acquired by PURCHASER.\n\nSo in summary, yes there is a restriction on SONY's ability to compete with PURCHASER, though the specific terms of that restriction are not fully detailed in the Intellectual Property Agreement itself.",

The user is asking if there's a restriction on a party's ability to compete with the other or operate in a certain geography, business, or tech sector based on the provided context.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the context thoroughly. The context is about an IP Agreement. The sections mentioned are about each party's sole rights to their intellectual property, no liability for injuries or losses, insolvency, continuing obligations, no implied licenses, no sublicenses, and successors and assigns.\n\nLooking at each section:\n\n- Section 3.2 says each party has the sole right to apply for and maintain IP protection without needing to inform the other. This seems to emphasize ownership and control over their own IP but doesn't mention restrictions on competition or geography.\n\n- The liability section (NEITHER PARTY...) states that neither is liable for injuries, losses, etc., related to their products or advertising. This is about liability, not competition.\n\n- 7.3 Insolvency: If a party becomes insolvent, licenses terminate. Again, about termination conditions, not competition.\n\n- 7.4 Continuing obligations: Termination doesn't affect prior liabilities. Still not relevant to competition.\n\n- 3.3 No Implied License: Only explicit licenses are granted. Doesn't restrict competition.\n\n- 3.4 No Sublicense Rights: No sublicensing allowed. Not about competition.\n\n- 9.3 Successors and Assigns: Assignment requires consent except in mergers or asset sales. This is about assignment rights, not competition.\n\nNowhere in the provided context do I see any clauses that restrict a party from competing with the other. There's no mention of non-compete clauses, geographical limitations, or restrictions on business sectors or technologies. The focus is on IP ownership, liability, and administrative aspects of the agreement. The parties have sole rights to their IP but can choose to abandon or stop maintaining it without informing the other. There's no indication that they can't operate in the same markets or sectors. Therefore, the answer should be that there are no such restrictions based on the given text.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: No, the provided context does not include any restrictions on a party's ability to compete with the counterparty or operate in a specific geography, business, or technology sector.

      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the provisions in the Intellectual Property Agreement, a party's liability does not appear to be uncapped upon a breach of its obligations.\n\nThe key relevant sections are:\n\n1. Section 4.2 on Indemnification - This section states that the parties will indemnify each other for liabilities relating to their respective IP assets and liabilities. However, there is no indication that the indemnification is uncapped or unlimited.\n\n2. Section 4.3 - This section incorporates the indemnification terms from the Separation Agreement, which also do not indicate that the indemnification is uncapped.\n\n3. There are no other provisions in the Intellectual Property Agreement that suggest the parties have uncapped or unlimited liability for breaches of the agreement, including for IP infringement or breach of confidentiality obligations.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the contract, the parties' liability does not appear to be uncapped upon a breach of their obligations. The indemnification and liability provisions seem to be limited in scope and subject to the other terms and conditions of the agreement.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out the answer to this question. The user is asking whether a party's liability is uncapped when they breach their obligations in the contract, specifically mentioning IP infringement or confidentiality breaches.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context to see if there's any mention of liability caps or uncapped liability. The context is a legal agreement between SpinCo and Parent, focusing on indemnification and liability. \n\nLooking at the sections mentioned, like 4.2 Indemnification and the allocation of costs and recoveries, there's a lot about indemnifying each other for certain liabilities. For example, SpinCo has to indemnify Parent for SpinCo IP Liabilities, and Parent has to do the same for Parent IP Liabilities. The language says \"to the fullest extent permitted by Law,\" which might imply that there's no cap unless restricted by law. \n\nIn the context, under 4.2(c), there's a part about allocation of costs and recoveries. It mentions that the Enforcing Party bears the costs of enforcement actions and gets the recoveries after reimbursing expenses. But this seems more about how costs are split rather than liability caps.\n\nAlso, in the termination clause, it says that if the agreement is terminated before the effective time, no party has liability. But that's a specific scenario. \n\nThe key part might be in the indemnification sections. The indemnification is required \"to the fullest extent permitted by Law,\" which could mean that unless there's a legal cap, they're liable without limit. However, the question is whether the contract itself imposes a cap. The context doesn't mention any specific caps or limits on liability beyond what's allowed by law. So if the law allows for uncapped liability, then the parties are bound by that. \n\nAdditionally, in 4.2(d), there's a mention of settling IP actions without the other party's consent if it imposes liability on them. This suggests that settlements can't be made without consent if they would create liability, but again, it's about the process rather than the amount.\n\nSo putting it all together, the contract doesn't specify a cap on liability. It uses \"to the fullest extent permitted by Law,\" which implies that liability isn't capped by the contract itself but is subject to whatever legal limits exist. Therefore, unless there's a legal cap, the liability would be uncapped. The answer would be yes, unless restricted",

The total annual franchise fee paid by the Grantee (Roanoke Gas Company) to the three localities (Grantor, Roanoke, and Salem) is set at $98,196 for the base year 2016.\n\n2.

The franchise fee is calculated solely based on the pro-rata percentage of total gas sales, without any apparent caps or thresholds.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if there's a fee increase or consent requirement when one party's use of the product/services exceeds a certain threshold, based on the provided context.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the context given. The context is a Franchise Agreement between the Town of Vinton and Roanoke Gas Company. The key sections here are about the Franchise Fee. \n\nLooking at part (a) of the Franchise Fee section, it mentions that the base year total annual Franchise Fee is $98,196 for 2016. The fee is calculated based on the percentage share of gas sales within each locality's territorial limits. So, Grantor's fee is a pro-rata share based on where the gas sales occur. \n\nThen in part (b), it states that for each succeeding year, the total annual Franchise Fee is increased by 3% compounded annually. This is a standard annual increase, not dependent on usage thresholds. The percentage share for each locality is still determined by the same formula as in part (a), based on sales distribution. \n\nThe question is about exceeding a threshold. The context doesn't mention any specific thresholds for usage that would trigger a fee increase or require consent. The fee is based on sales distribution and automatically adjusted by 3% each year. There's no mention of a consent requirement if usage exceeds a certain amount. The only condition affecting the fee is the sales distribution percentage, which is recalculated each year. \n\nSo, the answer would be that there's an automatic 3% annual increase regardless of usage thresholds, and no consent requirement is mentioned. The fee is adjusted based on sales distribution percentages, but there's no threshold that triggers additional fees or requires consent beyond the annual calculation.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: The Franchise Fee includes an automatic 3% annual increase compounded each year, regardless of usage thresholds. There is no explicit mention of additional fee increases or consent requirements tied to exceeding specific usage thresholds. The fee is calculated based on the pro rata share of gas sales within each locality's territorial limits, with adjustments made annually according to the 3% increase. Consent requirements are not outlined in the context for exceeding usage thresholds.",

      "question": "Does the contract contain a license grant to a licensee (incl. sublicensor) and the affiliates of such licensee/sublicensor?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, the contract does contain a license grant to the Reseller. Section 1 states that \"Reseller is hereunder licensed to market MediaNet Group Technologies' Brand-A-Port portals (\"PORTALS\") and to resell MediaNet Group Technologies products and services for compensation in accordance with the annexed \"RESELLING SCHEDULE.\"\"\n\nHowever, the contract does not appear to explicitly grant a license to the affiliates of the Reseller. The license is granted solely to the Reseller (International Direct Response, Inc.) and does not mention any rights being granted to the Reseller's affiliates.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the contract contains a license grant to a licensee, including their affiliates. The user provided a context from a legal document, specifically a Reseller Agreement. Let me go through the context step by step.\n\nFirst, the context mentions \"All rights granted by Reseller hereunder to MediaNet Group Technologies shall terminate.\" So, the Reseller is granting some rights to MediaNet, but those rights terminate. Then it says \"All rights granted by MediaNet Group Technologies hereunder to Reseller shall terminate, subject to the continuing obligation...\" So MediaNet is granting rights to the Reseller, but those also terminate except for the payment obligation in Section 8.\n\nNext, there's a part about the Reseller not being able to assign or transfer the agreement without MediaNet's consent, except to a successor. That might relate to sublicensing, but it's about assignment, not necessarily a license grant.\n\nLooking at section 5.2, it's about Intellectual Property, but the exact content isn't provided. The PROPRITARY RIGHTS section starts with 5.1 OWNERSHIP, but again, the details aren't here. The main agreement is between MediaNet Group Technologies and the Reseller, allowing the Reseller to resell licenses of MediaNet's products. \n\nThe question is whether the contract includes a license grant to a licensee (the Reseller) and their affiliates. The agreement authorizes the Reseller as an agent to resell licenses, which implies that MediaNet is granting the Reseller the right to sell their products. However, the term \"license grant\" here might refer to the Reseller getting a license to use the products, but the context doesn't explicitly mention that. It's more about the Reseller acting as an agent to sell licenses. \n\nAlso, there's no mention of affiliates of the Reseller being included in the license. The part about assignment to a successor might imply that if the Reseller is acquired, the successor could take over, but that's not the same as affiliates. The key point is whether the Reseller is granted a license to use the products themselves or just to resell them. Since the Reseller's role is to resell licenses, the actual license to use the PORTALS would be granted to end-users, not the Reseller. Therefore, the contract here is about the Reseller's rights to sell, not necessarily a license to use the product.",

      "question": "Is a party subject to obligations after the termination or expiration of a contract, including any post-termination transition, payment, transfer of IP, wind-down, last-buy, or similar commitments?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the consulting agreement provided, there are several provisions that indicate the parties do have certain obligations that survive the termination or expiration of the agreement:\n\n1. Section 8.2 states that the obligations of Sections 3, 5, 6 and 7 shall survive any termination of the agreement. These sections cover key provisions such as:\n   - Independent contractor relationship (Section 3)\n   - Confidentiality and non-disclosure of proprietary information (Section 5) \n   - Ownership of intellectual property and work product (Section 6)\n   - Restrictive covenants like non-solicitation and non-competition (Section 7)\n\n2. Section 8.1 requires the consultant to promptly return all materials, property, documents, data, and other information belonging to the company upon termination.\n\n3. Section 9.7 on indemnification provides obligations that survive termination for a period of 3 years.\n\n4. The Statement of Work indicates the initial 12-month term will automatically renew for an additional 12 months unless the agreement is terminated, suggesting ongoing obligations during any renewal period.\n\nSo in summary, yes, the agreement demonstrates that the parties have certain post-termination obligations, particularly around confidentiality, intellectual property, restrictive covenants, and indemnification. The agreement is structured to have key provisions survive beyond the termination or expiration of the overall consulting relationship.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether a party is subject to obligations after the termination or expiration of a contract, including things like post-termination transition, payment, transfer of IP, wind-down, last-buy, or similar commitments. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the provided context. The context is a section from a contract, specifically about obligations surviving termination. Let me go through each part.\n\nThe first part mentions that the obligations of Sections 3, 5, 6, and 7 survive any termination. Then there's a part (d) that says a specific section survives for three years after termination. \n\nNext, there's a clause about a Change of Control and termination without cause, which would result in a termination fee. That seems like a payment obligation post-termination. \n\nThen there are termination events listed, such as death, bankruptcy, termination for cause, and 90-day notice. The definition of Termination for Cause includes fraud or breach of agreement. \n\nAfter termination, the consultant must return all materials and property belonging to the company, which relates to transfer of information or IP. The consultant is prohibited from taking any such materials. \n\nSo, putting this together, the contract does have obligations that survive termination. These include returning property (IP transfer), payment obligations (like the 12-month fee upon Change of Control), and other duties like not taking materials. The sections mentioned (3,5,6,7) likely cover other obligations like transition periods or wind-down activities. The three-year survival period in part (d) also indicates that some obligations last beyond termination. \n\nTherefore, the answer should confirm that yes, parties are subject to post-termination obligations, including the examples given in the question. The context provides specific instances like returning materials, payment upon termination without cause, and survival of certain sections for a set period.\n</think>\n\nYes, a party is subject to obligations after the termination or expiration of the contract. The context explicitly outlines several post-termination commitments:  \n\n1. **Surviving Obligations**: Sections 3, 5, 6, and 7 of the Agreement (likely covering confidentiality, payment terms, IP ownership, or other key duties) survive termination indefinitely. Additionally, Section (d) specifies that certain obligations survive for **three (3) years** post-termination.  \n\n2. **Termination Fee**: If the CONSULTANT is terminated without cause",

The Effective Date of the original Agreement is March 1, 1996, and the Amendment is effective October 1, 1996. But without knowing how long the initial term was (e.g., one year, two years), we can't calculate the expiration date. \n\nIs there any other clue? The document mentions \"Confidential Doc Rev 2/97\" and \"7/15/98\" at the bottom. Maybe the \"Rev 2/97\" refers to a revision in February 1997, but that's probably not relevant. The date 7/15/98 might be when the document was created or last revised, but that's also not directly related to the term. \n\nSince",

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking which state or country's law governs the interpretation of the contract based on the provided context.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the context given. The context is a legal document, probably a contract. The key part here is the last paragraph where it says, \"This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with, and governed by, the laws of the State of Georgia, without regard to the conflicts of law rules of such state.\"\n\nSo, the question is straightforward. The governing law clause is usually found in contracts to determine which jurisdiction's laws apply if there's a dispute. The phrase \"governed by the laws of the State of Georgia\" clearly indicates that Georgia's laws are in effect. The mention of \"without regard to the conflicts of law rules\" means that even if there's a conflict with another jurisdiction's laws, Georgia's will be used.\n\nI should make sure there's no other part of the context that might mention a different jurisdiction. Scanning through the rest of the context, the main sections talk about compliance, severability, third-party agreements, and obligations of the parties. There's no mention of another state or country's law. The last paragraph is the only one specifying Georgia.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be the State of Georgia. The user might be testing if I can locate the governing law clause in a legal document. It's important to be precise here. The answer is Georgia, USA, but since the question asks for the state/country, and Georgia is a state in the US, specifying \"State of Georgia\" is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe interpretation of the contract is governed by the **State of Georgia**. The context explicitly states: \"This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with, and governed by, the laws of the State of Georgia, without regard to the conflicts of law rules of such state.\" This clause directly designates Georgia's laws as the governing authority for the contract. \n\n**Answer:** The State of Georgia.",

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether there's a non-contracting party who is a beneficiary to some or all of the clauses in the contract and can enforce rights against a contracting party.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context. The context includes several clauses from a contract. Let me go through each part.\n\nLooking at section (f), it's about force majeure, allowing parties not to be in breach if they can't perform due to circumstances beyond their control. Then (c) talks about waivers needing written agreement from both parties. (d) is about assignment requiring consent. (e) states that the parties are independent contractors, not agents or partners. Then there's a section on survival of certain sections after termination, (g) about severability, and (h) governing law and jurisdiction.\n\nThe question is about a third party beneficiary. The key here is to check if any clause in the contract explicitly or implicitly allows a third party to enforce the contract. The answer depends on whether the contract has a third-party beneficiary clause. \n\nLooking at the provided sections, none of them mention third-party beneficiaries. Section (e) specifically says that the parties are independent contractors and not agents or partners, which might imply that they can't bind each other to third parties. Also, section (d) requires written consent for assignment, which is about transferring rights, not about third-party enforcement.\n\nThe survival clause (the first part) mentions that certain provisions are enforceable after termination, but that's between the contracting parties. The severability clause (g) allows remaining provisions to stay if some are invalid, but again, not about third parties.\n\nSince there's no mention of third-party beneficiaries in any of the provided clauses, the answer would be no. The contract doesn't allow non-contracting parties to enforce any clauses against the contracting parties. The clauses are between the two contracting parties only.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: No, there is no indication in the provided context that a non-contracting party is a beneficiary to any clauses in the contract. The clauses explicitly govern the relationship between the two contracting parties. For example:  \n- **Section (e)** clarifies that the parties are independent contractors and not agents, partners, or joint venturers, reinforcing that no third party is represented or bound by the agreement.  \n- **Section (d)** prohibits assignment of rights or obligations without written consent, further limiting third-party involvement.",

The user is asking about the duration of any warranty against defects or errors in technology, products, or services provided under the contract. The context provided is a warranty clause from a contract.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the context to find mentions of warranty duration. The first part of the warranty says that the Company warrants the Products are merchantable and have a shelf life of at least 12 months. The shelf life part might be relevant here. \n\nThe warranty also mentions that the Products are manufactured, labeled, and packaged in compliance with laws. But the key part for duration is the 12-month shelf life. However, the question is about the duration of the warranty itself, not the shelf life. Wait, does the warranty last for the shelf life period? The warranty states that at the time of shipment, the products have a remaining shelf life of 12 months. But the warranty's duration might be tied to that shelf life. \n\nLooking further, the Customer's exclusive remedy is replacement of products that don't meet the standards. The warranty doesn't mention an explicit time period beyond the shelf life. The Company disclaims other warranties, like merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose beyond what's stated. So the only warranty duration mentioned is the 12-month shelf life. \n\nBut wait, the question is about the duration of the warranty. If the warranty covers defects during the shelf life, then the warranty period would be 12 months. However, the warranty is about the product's condition at shipment. The 12-month shelf life is a requirement at the time of shipment, but does the warranty last for that entire period? The replacement remedy is at the delivery point, but maybe the warranty is only for the duration of the shelf life. \n\nSo the answer would be that the warranty duration is 12 months, based on the remaining shelf life. The contract doesn't specify a separate warranty period beyond that. The other parts about indemnification and force majeure don't affect the warranty duration. Therefore, the duration is 12 months as per the shelf life mentioned.\n</think>\n\nThe warranty provided by the Company does not explicitly state a duration for defects or errors in technology, products, or services beyond the **12-month remaining shelf life** of the Products at the time of shipment.

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if there's a requirement in the provided context that a party not disparage the counterparty.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the context carefully. The context is part of a legal agreement between an Affiliate and Network 1. The sections mentioned include insolvency, rights of Network 1 regarding contractors, assignment of the agreement, and indemnification clauses.\n\nLooking at the sections provided, I'll start by scanning for any mention of disparagement or non-disparagement. The question is about a non-disparagement clause. In legal contracts, such clauses are common and usually found in sections dealing with general obligations, representations, or indemnification.\n\nIn the given context, the main sections are about insolvency, rights of Network 1 to manage contractors, assignment of the agreement, and indemnification. The indemnification part (last paragraph) mentions that the Affiliate must indemnify Network 1, VISA, MasterCard, and the Member Bank against losses due to failure to comply with the agreement, misrepresentation, etc. However, there's no explicit mention of disparagement or non-disparagement. \n\nThe term \"disparage\" isn't used anywhere in the provided text. The closest might be the indemnification for misrepresentation, but that's different from disparagement. Disparagement typically refers to making negative statements about the other party, which could harm their reputation. Since the context doesn't mention anything about not making negative statements or protecting the other party's reputation, there's no non-disparagement clause here.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided context, the answer should be that there is no such requirement.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: No, the provided context does not include a requirement for either party to refrain from disparaging the counterparty. The text focuses on insolvency provisions, rights of Network 1 regarding contractors, assignment terms, and indemnification obligations, but there is no explicit non-disparagement clause or related language.",

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the contract contains a license grant by affiliates of the licensor or that includes intellectual property of affiliates of the licensor. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context to find any mentions of licensing or intellectual property related to affiliates. The context is a legal agreement between two parties, Hyatt and Playa, discussing their obligations regarding third-party offers and their respective rights.\n\nLooking at the third paragraph, there's a part where Hyatt agrees to notify Playa if a third party wants to operate a Hyatt All-Inclusive Resort. Similarly, Playa must notify Hyatt if a third party wants them to manage a resort and hasn't chosen a brand yet. The term \"Hyatt All-Inclusive Resort\" suggests that Hyatt is providing a brand, which is a form of intellectual property. \n\nThe question is about whether there's a license grant by affiliates or involving their IP. The context mentions that if a third party approaches Hyatt (non-affiliate) and wants to use the Hyatt brand, Hyatt has to give Playa a chance to manage it. Similarly, if Playa gets an offer to manage a resort without a brand, they have to let Hyatt know to possibly provide the Hyatt brand. \n\nThis implies that Hyatt is granting a license (franchise rights) to use their brand, which is intellectual property. However, the question is about whether the license is granted by affiliates of the licensor. The context doesn't explicitly mention affiliates granting the license. Instead, it's Hyatt itself granting the license to third parties, with Playa having an option to manage. \n\nThe key part is \"Hyatt agrees to provide notice to Playa... to negotiate for the opportunity to manage that Hyatt All-Inclusive Resort.\" The use of \"Hyatt All-Inclusive Resort\" indicates that the brand is Hyatt's IP. If Hyatt is granting the franchise rights (license) to a third party, then that's a license involving Hyatt's IP. However, the question is whether the license is granted by affiliates. Since the context doesn't mention affiliates of Hyatt granting the license, but rather Hyatt itself, the answer might be no. \n\nBut wait, the question is phrased as \"license grant by affiliates of the licensor or that includes intellectual property of affiliates.\" The licensor here is Hyatt.

The indemnification provisions in Section VIII relate to losses arising from breaches or misrepresentations within the agreement itself.\n\nOverall, the agreement does not seem to restrict the parties from contesting intellectual property rights or bringing unrelated claims against each other.

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether a party is restricted from contesting the validity of the counterparty's intellectual property ownership or bringing unrelated claims against the counterparty. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the provided context. The context is a contract between MKOS and UTEK. The key sections here are about the assignment of rights, breach of contract, and indemnification.\n\nThe context mentions that the obligations are binding on successors and assigns, but UTEK can't assign without MKOS's consent. There's also a part about injunctive relief if there's a material breach. However, the question is about contesting IP ownership or bringing unrelated claims.\n\nLooking through the context, there's no explicit mention of restrictions on challenging IP ownership. The contract does talk about technology transfer where UTEK acquires a license through a subsidiary and transfers it to MKOS. But there's no clause that says MKOS can't question the validity of that IP. Also, the context states that there are no other representations or warranties beyond what's in the agreement. That might imply that if there's a claim about IP validity, it's not covered here, but the contract doesn't prohibit such claims either.\n\nThe question is whether the contract restricts such actions. Since the context doesn't include any clauses that prevent a party from contesting IP ownership or bringing unrelated claims, the answer would be that they aren't restricted. The contract doesn't address those specific scenarios, so the parties are free to pursue such actions unless another part of the contract does restrict them. The indemnification provisions remain in effect even after termination, but that's about covering damages, not preventing claims.\n\nSo, the answer is no, the parties aren't restricted from contesting IP ownership or bringing unrelated claims based on the provided context.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: No, the context does not restrict a party from contesting the validity of the counterparty\u2019s ownership of intellectual property or bringing claims unrelated to the contract. The agreement does not include provisions that prohibit such actions. While the contract outlines obligations, technology transfer processes, and remedies for breaches, it does not address or limit claims regarding intellectual property validity or unrelated matters.

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether consent or notice is required if the contract is assigned to a third party. The context provided is a legal agreement, so I need to look through the relevant sections to find the answer.\n\nFirst, the general rule is in the first sentence: \"This Agreement may not be assigned, sold or transferred without the prior written consent of the other party.\" So normally, consent is needed. But then there's an exception mentioned in the next part. \n\nLooking at the section labeled (d), it talks about when the agreement becomes binding, but that might not be directly relevant here. The key part is after that, starting with \"Notwithstanding the foregoing...\" which says Rogers can assign its rights without consent under certain conditions. Specifically, if the assignment is to a company that controls Rogers, is controlled by Rogers, or under common control, or to a purchaser of assets related to the ROD Service. Also, a change of control of Rogers isn't considered an assignment. \n\nSo for Rogers, if they assign to those specific entities, they don't need consent. But for others, consent is required. Also, the notice requirements are mentioned later, but the question is about consent or notice for assignment. The notice part is about how to give notices, but the main point here is consent. \n\nThe user's question is about whether consent or notice is required. The answer depends on who is doing the assigning. If Rogers is assigning to the specified entities, no consent is needed. For others, consent is required. Also, when an assignment happens, there's a notice requirement as per the notice section, but the question is about whether consent or notice is required. The notice is part of the process but the main requirement is consent unless under the exceptions. \n\nSo the answer should state that consent is required unless it's an assignment by Rogers to the specified entities, in which case consent isn't needed. Also, there's a notice requirement for changing addresses, but that's separate from the assignment itself. The key is consent unless under the exceptions.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: Consent is required for assigning the contract to a third party, except in specific cases where Rogers may assign its rights without consent. Specifically, Rogers may assign the Agreement **without consent** to (i) entities under common control or ownership, or (ii) a purchaser of all or substantially all assets related to the ROD Service.

      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the information provided in the contract, there does not appear to be an exclusive dealing commitment with the counterparty. The agreement is for SEV to provide maintenance services for Dairy Crest's vehicle fleet, but there is no indication that Dairy Crest is required to procure all of its maintenance services exclusively from SEV. The agreement also does not include any prohibitions on Dairy Crest working with other parties for maintenance services or other services. Overall, the agreement appears to be a standard service contract without any exclusive dealing commitments.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if there's an exclusive dealing commitment with the counterparty in the provided contract context. They want to know if there's a commitment to procure all requirements from one party or prohibitions on working with others, either during or after the contract.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the context given. Let me start by scanning the sections mentioned. The context includes several clauses from a contract between two parties, likely SEV and DCL. The relevant sections here might be about assignments, sub-contractors, third-party rights, and termination.\n\nLooking at section 26 (Assignment and sub-contractors), there are clauses about sub-contracting. Specifically, 26.2 says SEV can sub-contract with DCL's consent, and 26.3 states that SEV can't engage agents or sub-contractors for Maintenance Services without DCL's consent. Also, 26.4 holds SEV responsible for sub-contractors' actions. This seems to control who SEV can work with for certain services, but it's about sub-contracting specific obligations, not necessarily an exclusive dealing commitment. It's more about control over sub-contractors rather than exclusivity in procurement.\n\nThen there's the third-party rights section, which says non-parties can't enforce the contract terms. That doesn't directly relate to exclusivity.\n\nTermination clauses in 16.2 mention termination for breach or insolvency, but again, not exclusivity.\n\nThe other sections (30.2 and 31) talk about not relying on representations outside the agreement and assignment, which don't address exclusivity.\n\nSo, the key here is whether any part of the contract requires one party to exclusively deal with the other. The sub-contracting clauses allow SEV to use sub-contractors with consent, but there's no mention of SEV being prohibited from working with others outside of that. There's no clause stating that DCL must procure all services from SEV, or that SEV can't provide services to third parties. The focus is on SEV's responsibility when using sub-contractors, not on exclusivity.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided context, there's no explicit exclusive dealing commitment. The contract allows for sub-contracting with consent but doesn't enforce exclusivity in procurement or prohibit working with others. The answer should be that there's",

The user is asking if there's a clause in the provided context that grants a right of first refusal, offer, or negotiation regarding purchasing, licensing, marketing, distributing equity, tech, assets, products, or services.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the context carefully. The context is an agreement between Principal and Distributor. Let me read each part again.\n\nThe first part says that additions to the Products require mutual agreement. If the Distributor rejects a new product, the Principal can market and distribute it. So if the Distributor says no, the Principal keeps the right. That seems like if the Distributor doesn't want to add a product, the Principal can do it themselves. But does that count as a right of first refusal? Maybe not exactly. A right of first refusal would mean the Distributor has the first chance to accept or reject before the Principal can take action. Here, the Distributor can reject, and then the Principal can proceed. So maybe that's a right of first refusal for the Distributor? Wait, the Principal is the one who gets to do it if the Distributor rejects. So the Distributor's rejection leads to Principal's right. But the question is about a right of first refusal, etc., for one party. The Distributor has the right to reject, but if they do, the Principal can take over. So maybe the Distributor has a right to first refusal? Or is it the Principal's right?\n\nWait, the Principal is the one who can market the product if the Distributor rejects. So the Distributor's rejection leads to Principal's right. But the question is about a right of first refusal, etc. Let me check the other parts.\n\nNext, the Principal represents they own the IP. Then, the Principal can contact and market products but must pass sales leads to the Distributor. Then, the Distributor can't assign the agreement without Principal's consent. The Principal grants non-exclusive rights to Distributor in Romania.\n\nSo looking for any clause where one party has the right to be offered first before the other can take action. The first part about adding products: if Distributor rejects, Principal can market. That seems like if the Distributor doesn't want it, the Principal can take over. But is that a right of first refusal? A right of first refusal would typically mean that if one party wants to sell or offer something, the other has the first chance to",

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if a party can terminate the contract without cause, just by giving notice and waiting the required period. Let me check the context provided.\n\nFirst, looking at the CEO's side. The context says that if Maimon can't serve as CEO due to reasons like death or disability, the company can terminate with five days' notice. But that's with cause, right? Because it's based on Maimon's inability to perform. Then it mentions Maimon can resign at any time with 30 days' notice. So Maimon can terminate without cause by giving 30 days' notice.\n\nNow for the company's side. The company can terminate after the Minimum Period (which is 12 months) with five days' notice. The key here is \"at its discretion and at its option\" after the Minimum Period. The Minimum Period is the first 12 months. So after that 12-month period, the company can terminate without cause by giving five days' notice. But during the first 12 months, unless there's a breach or something, they can't terminate without cause? Wait, the context says \"the Company may in its discretion and at its option terminate this Agreement at any time after the Minimum Period upon five days prior written notice to Maimon.\" So \"after the Minimum Period\" means after the 12 months. So during the Minimum Period, the company can't terminate without cause? Unless there's some other provision.\n\nAlso, the term starts on the Effective Date and continues for a minimum of 12 months. After that, it's on mutual agreement. But the termination clause says the company can terminate after the Minimum Period. So during the first 12 months, the company can't terminate without cause unless there's a specific reason like Maimon's failure to perform. But after 12 months, they can terminate with five days' notice. So the answer would be yes, but only after the Minimum Period. Also, Maimon can resign anytime with 30 days' notice. So both parties can terminate without cause, but under different conditions. The company can do it after 12 months with five days' notice, and Maimon can resign anytime with 30 days' notice. Therefore, the answer is yes, but with the caveat about the Minimum Period for the company's termination right.\n</think>",

The user is asking whether the contract includes a license grant by affiliates of the licensor or that includes intellectual property of the licensor's affiliates.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the context provided. The main clauses mentioned are 10.2, 10.3, 10.4, and the definitions in 1.1. \n\nStarting with Clause 10.2: Each Party grants the other a non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free license to use the other's Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) strictly necessary for marketing and promotional obligations under the Agreement. The key here is that the license is between the two Parties, not their affiliates. The definition of \"Affiliates\" is given as subsidiaries or entities mutually agreed in writing. But the license in 10.2 is between the Parties themselves, not their affiliates. \n\nLooking at the definitions, \"Group\" is defined as a company and its Holding Company, Subsidiaries, and Subsidiaries of the Holding Company. However, the license in 10.2 is specifically between the Parties, not their Groups or Affiliates. There's no mention in 10.2 that the license extends to affiliates. The license is only for the other Party's IPR, not their affiliates' IPR. \n\nClause 10.3 says the license expires at the end of the Term. No mention of affiliates here either. \n\nClause 11.8 and 11.9 deal with confidentiality and don't mention licenses. \n\nThe definitions don't indicate that the license in 10.2 includes affiliates. The term \"Affiliates\" is defined, but the license is between the Parties, not their Affiliates. Unless there's a clause that explicitly extends the license to affiliates, which I don't see here. \n\nSo, the answer would be no. The license is between the two Parties, not their affiliates, and it doesn't include the IPR of the licensor's affiliates. The license is strictly for the other Party's IPR as needed for their obligations under the Agreement.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: No, the contract does not contain a license grant by affiliates of the licensor or that includes intellectual property of affiliates of the licensor.

      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the terms of the agreement, it does not appear that either party can terminate the contract without cause solely by giving notice and allowing a waiting period to expire.\n\nThe termination provisions are outlined in Section 14.2 of the agreement. This section lists the specific conditions under which either party can terminate the agreement, and they all require some form of material breach, insolvency, or other substantive reason for termination.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- Section 14.2(a) allows either party to terminate immediately upon written notice in the event the other party becomes insolvent, files for bankruptcy, admits inability to pay debts, etc.\n\n- Section 14.2(a) also allows either party to terminate immediately upon written notice if the other party fails to cure a default within 30 days after written notice.\n\n- Section 14.2(b) allows Licensor to terminate with 90 days' prior written notice if Licensee does not meet certain revenue targets (the \"Quota Amount\").\n\n- Section 14.2(b) also allows Licensor to terminate with 30 days' prior written notice if Licensee undergoes a change of control event.\n\nThere is no provision that would allow either party to simply terminate the agreement without cause by giving notice and allowing a waiting period to expire. The termination rights are limited to the specific circumstances outlined in Section 14.2.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if a party can terminate the contract without cause by just giving notice and waiting. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context. The question is about termination without cause, meaning the party doesn't have a specific reason like a breach, just wants to end the contract.\n\nLooking at the sections mentioned. Article 14 is about Term and Termination. Let's check Section 14.1 first. It says the agreement is effective until the earlier of termination or two years. Then it mentions automatic renewal for one-year terms unless a party gives 60 days written notice before the end of the original or any renewal term. Also, if they don't agree on the Quota Amount 60 days before the term starts, it might not renew. \n\nSo, if a party gives 60 days notice before the term ends, they can terminate without needing a specific cause. That seems like termination without cause because it's just based on the notice period. \n\nThen in Section 14.2, there are other termination reasons. For example, under 14.2(a)(1), termination can happen immediately if the other party becomes insolvent, etc. But those are for specific causes. Under 14.2(a)(2), termination for failure to perform, which also requires a 30-day cure period. But again, that's for a cause (non-payment or default). \n\nSection 14.2(b)(1) talks about Licensor terminating if the Quota isn't met, requiring 90 days notice. But that's based on performance (Quota Amount), so it's not without cause. \n\nThe key part here is in Section 14.1. The automatic renewal clause states that the agreement renews unless a party gives 60 days notice. So, if a party wants to terminate without any specific cause, they can just send the notice 60 days before the term ends. That would allow them to terminate without needing any other reason. \n\nSo the answer should be yes, because Section 14.1 allows termination by giving 60 days notice before the term's end, which is without cause.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: Yes, a party can terminate the contract without cause by providing written notice 60 days prior to the end of the original or any renewal term. Section 14.1 explicitly states that the",

Airspan retains the validity of its copyright in any written material to which it has made a copyright claim (Section 9.2). \n\n3. The agreement grants Distributor only a license to resell the Airspan Products, and does not transfer any right, title, or interest in any of the Airspan Software to Distributor (Section 1.1).\n\n4. The agreement states that nothing in the agreement is to be construed as granting to or conferring upon Distributor any rights, by license or otherwise, express or implied, in Airspan's Confidential Information, other than the right to use the Confidential Information for the purpose of the agreement (Section 10.6).\n\nThere are no provisions in the contract indicating that intellectual property created by one party becomes the property of the counterparty, either under the terms of the contract or upon the occurrence of certain events. The contract is structured to maintain Airspan's ownership and control over its intellectual property.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether intellectual property created by one party becomes the property of the other party either under the contract terms or certain events. I need to check the provided context for any clauses related to IP ownership.\n\nLooking through the context, there's a section about indemnity for intellectual property rights. Specifically, Airspan indemnifies the Distributor against claims of infringement. But I don't see any mention of ownership transfer. The indemnity is about defending against third-party claims, not about who owns the IP.\n\nThe assignment clause (21.3) talks about not assigning the agreement without consent, but that's about the agreement itself, not IP. The confidentiality sections (10.7 to 10.11) mention handling confidential info and non-compete, but again, not IP ownership. \n\nThere's a part in 10.9 where if Distributor discloses prior inventions to Airspan, it doesn't create any obligation unless a separate contract is made. So that suggests that any IP created by Distributor before isn't automatically Airspan's. \n\nThe main IP clause is 17.1-17.4 about indemnification. Nowhere does it say that IP created by one party becomes the other's. The contract doesn't mention ownership transfer of IP created during the agreement. Unless there's a specific clause about that, the answer would be no. The user's question is about ownership transfer, but the context doesn't address that. So the answer is no, the contract doesn't make one party's IP the other's property.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: No, the provided context does not indicate that intellectual property (IP) created by one party becomes the property of the counterparty under the contract or upon specific events. The agreement focuses on indemnification for third-party IP infringement claims (Section 17.1\u201317.4) and confidentiality obligations (Sections 10.7\u201310.11). It does not include provisions transferring ownership of IP created by either party. For example, Section 10.9 explicitly states that if the Distributor discloses pre-existing ideas or inventions to Airspan, no ownership or confidentiality relationship is automatically established unless a separate written contract is executed. Ownership of IP remains governed by the parties' pre-existing rights or any separate agreements, not by this contract.",

        "INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS INDEMNITY. 17.1 Airspan agrees to indemnify and hold Distributor harmless with respect to any suit, claim, or proceeding brought against Distributor by a third party alleging that Distributor's use of the Equipment or the Software, separately or in combination, as a whole or in part, constitutes an infringement of any patent or copyright or misuse of proprietary or trade secret information. Airspan agrees to defend Distributor against any such claims and to pay all litigation costs, reasonable attorney's fees, settlement payments, and any damages awarded or resulting from any such claim. - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 20\n\n17.2 Distributor shall promptly advise Airspan of any such suit, claim, or proceeding and shall co-operate with Airspan in the defense or settlement thereof. Airspan shall have sole control of the defense of any action involving such a claim and of all negotiations for its settlement or compromise. 17.3 In the event that an injunction is obtained against Distributor's use of the Equipment and/or the Software, in whole or in part, as a result of any such claim, Airspan shall use its best efforts to either: (a) procure for Distributor the right to continue using the portions of the Equipment or the Software enjoined from use; or (b) replace or modify the same with functionally equivalent or better Equipment and/or Software so that Distributor's use is not subject to any such injunction. In the event that Airspan cannot perform the remedies set forth in Sections 17.3(a) or 17.3(b), then Distributor shall have the right to return such Equipment and the Software to Airspan. In the event of such return, Airspan shall refund the depreciated value of the Equipment and the license to use the Software within thirty (30) days of the receipt by Airspan of the Equipment and the Software. 17.4 This indemnity shall not apply to claims arising in respect to the use of the Equipment or Software supplied by Airspan or manufactured by its suppliers in accordance with any design or any special instruction furnished by Distributor, or which is used by Distributor in a manner or for a purpose not contemplated by this Agreement.",

The parties hereby irrevocably agree that all claims in respect of such action, suit or proceeding may be heard and determined in such courts.

        "10.7  Any copies of the Confidential Information made by Distributor shall reproduce proprietary marking and legends included therein, but the provisions of this Agreement supersede any provisions of such legends inconsistent herewith. 10.8  The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall not be disclosed by Distributor to others, except with the prior, written consent of Airspan, or as may be required by law or as necessary to establish its rights hereunder. 10.9  If, in connection with its performance, Distributor discloses to Airspan any ideas, developments, or inventions conceived or actually reduced to practice by Distributor prior to its performance hereunder, no relationship, confidential or otherwise, express or implied, is established with Airspan by the disclosure thereof. With respect to any such disclosure, no obligation of any kind is assumed by nor may be implied against Airspan, its subsidiary, or associated companies unless a formal, separate, written contract regarding the subject of disclosure is consummated by the parties, and then the obligation shall be only as expressed in the separate contract. 10.10  Distributor agrees that any breach of the provisions of this Section by Distributor or Distributor's personnel, agents, or subcontractors, or any third party providing products or services to Distributor will cause immediate and irreparable injury to Airspan and that, in the event of such breach, Airspan shall be entitled to injunctive relief and any and all other remedies available at law or in equity. 10.11  After Distributor has received Airspan's Confidential Information and know-how, it will be impossible to segregate Airspan's knowledge and know- how from other knowledge acquired independently by Distributor. Accordingly, during the performance of this Agreement and for three (3) months after termination of services under this Agreement, Distributor will not offer services to third parties which compete with the services provided by Airspan under this Agreement, or otherwise use the knowledge acquired from Airspan in order to compete with Airspan or its customers. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary above, Distributor is not precluded from any activities which concern product sectors or industries other than those that concern products or services similar to those offered by Airspan in connection with this Agreement. Nothing in this paragraph will be construed to prevent Distributor from providing service to existing customers of Distributor which would result in their interruption of service to the public."
