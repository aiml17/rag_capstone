      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking about the duration of any warranty against defects or errors in technology, products, or services provided under the contract. The context provided is from an S-1/A filing from PCQuote Com Inc on July 21, 1999. The documents mentioned include an amendment to the Co-Branding Agreement between PC Quote, Inc. (PCQ) and A.B. Watley, Inc. (ABW), effective December 9, 1996.\n\nFirst, I need to check the context thoroughly. The main documents here are the Co-Branding Agreement and its amendment. The amendment is about Section 2, Part B, which is titled \"Term.\" The Term section usually outlines the duration of the contract. However, the user is asking about warranties against defects or errors, which is a different section of a contract, typically found in a separate clause like \"Warranties\" or \"Representations and Warranties.\"\n\nLooking at the provided context, there's no mention of warranties, defects, errors, or any duration related to them. The amendment here is specifically about the Term, which refers to how long the agreement is in effect. The dates mentioned (December 9, 1996, and the dates of agreement by Steven Malin and Howard Meltzer) relate to the effective dates of the amendment and the signatories' dates, but not the warranty period.\n\nSince the context doesn't include any information about warranties or their duration, the answer would be that the provided context does not specify the duration of any warranty against defects or errors. The user might need to refer to other sections of the Co-Branding Agreement that are not included here for details on warranties.\n</think>\n\nThe provided context does not specify the duration of any warranty against defects or errors in technology, products, or services under the contract. The documents referenced focus on an amendment to the \"Term\" section of the Co-Branding Agreement (effective December 9, 1996) and the parties' signatures, but they do not address warranties or their duration. Further details about warranties would require reviewing other sections of the full Co-Branding Agreement not included here. \n\n**Answer:** The context does not provide information about the duration of warranties against defects or errors.",

      "question": "Is a party\u2019s liability uncapped upon the breach of its obligation in the contract? This also includes uncap liability for a particular type of breach such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality obligation.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the context provided in the Cooperation Agreement, there does not appear to be any uncapped liability for a party's breach of the contract. The agreement does not explicitly state that a party's liability is uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.\n\nThe relevant sections are:\n\n1. Clause 5 on Confidential Information, which states that the obligations of confidentiality shall remain in force until the relevant information enters the public domain otherwise than by the default of a party. This suggests there is no uncapped liability for breach of the confidentiality obligation.\n\n2. Clause 4.1 regarding QIWI's obligation to settle transactions through Otkritie's bank. This clause states that if QIWI terminates this obligation, it shall pay a fee to Otkritie, but this fee is capped at RUB 50,000,000. This indicates a cap on liability for breach of this specific obligation.\n\n3. The agreement does not contain any other provisions that suggest uncapped liability for breach of the contract or specific types of breaches. The dispute resolution clause (Clause 9) also does not indicate uncapped damages.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the Cooperation Agreement, the liability of the parties does not appear to be uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether a party's liability is uncapped if they breach the contract, specifically looking at IP infringement or breach of confidentiality. \n\nFirst, I need to check the provided context for any clauses that mention liability caps or exclusions. The context includes several clauses, like 5.1 to 5.4 about confidentiality, 7.1 to 7.5 about assignments and third parties, and 9.6 to 9.9 about arbitration. \n\nLooking through the confidentiality sections (5.1-5.4), there's a lot about obligations not to disclose information and exceptions. But I don't see any mention of liability limits here. For example, 5.1 says they can't disclose confidential info, and 5.4 talks about what happens if an affiliate is compelled to disclose. However, there's no clause stating that liability is capped or excluded for breaches.\n\nThen, checking other parts of the contract. The arbitration clauses (9.6-9.9) mention that awards are final and binding, but again, no mention of liability caps. The assignment clauses (7.5) and third-party rights (7.6) also don't address liability limits.\n\nI need to look for any clause that might mention liability. The user's question is about whether liability is uncapped. If there's no clause that limits liability, then by default, the liability would be uncapped. But if there's a clause that says something like \"liability is limited to a certain amount\" or \"excludes certain damages,\" that would cap it. \n\nLooking through all the provided clauses again, I don't see any mention of liability limitations. The confidentiality obligations are strict, but there's no language about the extent of liability. For example, in 5.1, it says parties must not disclose info, but doesn't say what happens if they do. Similarly, other sections don't address liability caps. \n\nTherefore, based on the context provided, there's no clause that limits or caps liability for breaches, including IP infringement or confidentiality breaches. So the answer would be that the liability is uncapped.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: The provided context does not include any specific clauses that explicitly cap or limit a party's liability for breaches of the contract, including breaches of confidentiality obligations or intellectual property (IP) infringement.

      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, according to the General Provisions of the Sponsorship Agreement, the Sponsor (Rubio's Fresh Mexican Grill) must obtain and continuously maintain certain insurance policies for the benefit of the counterparty, SDBF (San Diego Ballpark Funding LLC):\n\nSpecifically, Section 8(c) states that Sponsor must obtain and continuously maintain the following insurance policies:\n\n1. Workers' Compensation insurance with minimum liability limits.\n\n2. An occurrence-based Commercial General Liability Insurance Policy with minimum liability limits.\n\nThe policies must name SDBF, Padres LP, the City of San Diego, and their subsidiary/affiliated companies and directors/officers/employees as Additional Insureds. The policies must also contain Cross Liability Endorsements and a Waiver of Subrogation in favor of SDBF.\n\nSponsor must provide SDBF with certificates of insurance evidencing compliance with these insurance requirements prior to the commencement of the sponsorship and annually prior to the expiration of each required insurance policy.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if there's a requirement for insurance that one party must maintain for the benefit of the counterparty. The context provided is about insurance policies that the Sponsor must obtain and maintain.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the context. The Sponsor is required to get insurance from an admitted carrier with an A.M. (maybe that's a typo, like AM Best rating? Not sure, but maybe not crucial here). The Sponsor must maintain these policies at their own expense. The insurance includes indemnity, insurance, and assumption of risk. \n\nThen there's a part about cancellation, non-renewal, or material modification requiring 30 days written notice to SDBF. Also, the Sponsor has to provide certificates of insurance to SDBF before the sponsorship starts and annually before each policy expires. Additionally, the coverage for Additional Insureds is primary, regardless of other insurance.\n\nSo the question is whether there's a requirement for one party (Sponsor) to maintain insurance for the benefit of the counterparty (SDBF). The answer seems to be yes. The Sponsor must maintain insurance that covers SDBF as an Additional Insured, and they have to provide proof. The mention of \"Additional Insureds\" implies that SDBF is a beneficiary of this insurance. The requirement to notify SDBF of any changes and provide certificates shows that the insurance is for SDBF's benefit. Also, the primary coverage clause ensures that SDBF's interests are protected even if there's other insurance involved.\n\nI need to make sure I'm not missing any nuances. The key points are the Sponsor's obligation to maintain insurance, the requirement to notify SDBF of policy changes, and providing certificates. All these indicate that the insurance is for SDBF's benefit. Therefore, the answer should confirm that yes, there is such a requirement.\n</think>\n\nYes, there is a requirement for insurance that must be maintained by the Sponsor for the benefit of the counterparty (SDBF). The Sponsor is obligated to obtain and maintain insurance policies that include SDBF as an **Additional Insured**, with coverage applying on a **primary basis** regardless of other insurance. The Sponsor must also provide SDBF with **certificates of insurance** to confirm compliance, notify SDBF of any cancellation, non-renewal, or material modification (30 days in advance), and ensure the policies remain in force",

The key here is whether the Agreement automatically renews after March 18, 2021, or if there's any provision for that. The context doesn't mention anything about automatic renewal. It only states the termination clause. The termination clause allows for ending the agreement either on the expiration date or earlier with notice. There's no mention of a renewal period beyond the initial term. \n\nThe other parts of the context talk about what happens upon termination, like the Distributor receiving orders and not handling competitive products.

Let me look through the provided context carefully.\n\nFirst, in section 1.1, it mentions that Airspan appoints the Distributor as an independent, exclusive distributor. The Distributor gets a license to resell Airspan Products in the Territory. But it's clear that this is a reseller license, not a software license. The key part here is that the Distributor's appointment grants them a license to resell, but no rights to the software itself.\n\nThen, looking at section 11.1, which is about the software license. It states that Airspan grants the Distributor a nonexclusive, non-transferable license to use the Software on a single System or unit of Equipment. The license is specific to the Distributor and doesn't mention affiliates. Also, it says the license is non-transferable unless agreed in writing. So, the Distributor can't sublicense to others unless Airspan allows it in writing.\n\nSection 11.2 outlines the restrictions on the Distributor, including not modifying the software, not reverse engineering, and not reproducing except for backups. There's no mention of affiliates here either. The license is strictly for the Distributor's use on Airspan's equipment.\n\nSection 21.3 talks about assignments and subcontracting, requiring prior written consent. If the Distributor wants to assign the agreement to an affiliate, Airspan can't unreasonably withhold consent. But this is about assigning the entire agreement, not the software license itself. The software license in 11.1 is non-transferable, so even if the Distributor is part of a larger company, the license doesn't automatically extend to affiliates.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The Distributor has a license to resell products and a non-transferable software license for their own use. There's no explicit grant of the software license to affiliates unless Airspan gives written consent. The reseller license might allow the Distributor to sublicense the software to their customers (since they resell the products), but the question is about the Distributor's affiliates. The contract doesn't mention granting the license to affiliates of the Distributor. The non-transferable clause in 11.1 would prevent the Distributor from sublicensing to affiliates unless Airspan agrees in writing. Therefore, the answer is no,",

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of the contract based on the provided context. The context is a legal document, probably an agreement between parties, given the sections about representations and warranties.\n\nLooking through the context, there are sections labeled (i), (ii), (iii), etc., which are typical in legal contracts. The first part mentions \"this Agreement\" multiple times. For example, in section (ii), it says \"the execution and delivery of this Agreement...\" and similar references in other sections. \n\nThe term \"Agreement\" is capitalized, which in legal documents usually indicates the formal name of the contract. Since there's no other specific name given, like \"Share Purchase Agreement\" or something else, the most likely answer is that the contract is referred to simply as \"the Agreement\" throughout the document. \n\nI don't see any other capitalized terms that would indicate a different name. The sections (i), (j), (g), etc., are parts of the Agreement. The answer should be \"Agreement\" as the name of the contract.\n</think>\n\nThe name of the contract is **the Agreement**.

Let me look through the context carefully.\n\nFirst, I see mentions of \"Tender Notice\" and \"Remarketing Agent\" in Schedule 1. Then there's a section about the Termination of Remarketing Agreement in Section 12. Further down, there's an Exhibit A - Form of Tender Notice. \n\nLooking at the bottom of the document, there's a part that says \"Signature Page to Remarketing Agreement (NVG Series [\u25cf] MFP)\". The mention of \"Remarketing Agreement\" here seems important. Also, in the context, there's a reference to \"the Remarketing Agreement, dated as of [\u25cf], between Nuveen AMT-Free Municipal Credit Income Fund, Nuveen Fund Advisors, LLC and the Remarketing Agent.\"\n\nPutting this together, the main contract being discussed here is the \"Remarketing Agreement.\" The other parts like the Tender Notice and Schedule 1 are components or exhibits to that main agreement. The answer should be the name of the primary contract, which is the Remarketing Agreement. The specific fund mentioned is Nuveen AMT-Free Municipal Credit Income Fund, but the contract's name is the Remarketing Agreement. The series is mentioned as NVG Series [\u25cf] MFP, but the exact name of the contract is likely \"Remarketing Agreement\" with the parties involved. However, the exact title might include the fund's name. Wait, in the last part, the Signature Page refers to \"Signature Page to Remarketing Agreement (NVG Series [\u25cf] MFP)\". So the full name might be \"Remarketing Agreement (NVG Series [\u25cf] MFP)\" but since the series is blank, maybe it's just \"Remarketing Agreement\" or the full name with the fund's name. The question is asking for the name of the contract. The contract is between the Nuveen AMT-Free Municipal Credit Income Fund, Nuveen Fund Advisors, LLC, and the Remarketing Agent. The title in the context is \"Remarketing Agreement\" with the parties. However, in the example given in the question, the answer is \"Remarketing Agreement\". Let me check again.

      "question": "Is a party subject to obligations after the termination or expiration of a contract, including any post-termination transition, payment, transfer of IP, wind-down, last-buy, or similar commitments?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, based on the information provided in the agreement, there are certain obligations that continue after the termination or expiration of the contract:\n\n1. The provisions of Sections 3.6, 4, 6, 8, 9 and 11 shall survive any termination of the agreement (Section 10.8).\n\n2. Any contract entered into by the Parties with a Marketer for the Product shall survive termination of the agreement in accordance with its terms, including any renewal rights provided therein (Section 10.1). \n\n3. Upon any breach by CAPSUGEL, CARDAX shall be permitted to use all Intellectual Property of CAPSUGEL used in the Formulation and the Product to the extent necessary for the development and marketing of the Product (Section 10.2).\n\n4. Upon any breach by CARDAX, CAPSUGEL shall be permitted to use all Intellectual Property of CARDAX used in the Active Ingredient and the Product to the extent necessary for the development and marketing of the Product in accordance with the terms of the agreement as of the date of such termination (Section 10.2).\n\n5. Each Party shall return to the other Party or to the other Party's designee no later than thirty (30) days after the effective date of termination all of such other Party's property, including all proprietary information, in its possession, except to the extent required to be retained by law or to comply with such Party's continuing obligations (Section 10.7).\n\nSo in summary, yes there are certain post-termination obligations, including the survival of certain provisions, the continuing effect of third-party contracts, and the return of proprietary information and materials.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether a party has obligations after the termination or expiration of a contract, specifically mentioning post-termination transition, payment, transfer of IP, wind-down, last-buy, or similar commitments.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the provided context. The context includes several sections from the agreement. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nStarting with the first paragraph under the context, it mentions that in the event of termination, each party must return the other's property, including proprietary information, within 30 days, unless required by law or to comply with continuing obligations. So that's a clear obligation post-termination: returning property. Also, there's a mention of \"continuing obligations,\" which implies there are other obligations beyond just returning property.\n\nLooking at Section 10.1 Term and Termination, it says that contracts with a Marketer for the Product survive termination according to their own terms. So any such contracts would still be in effect, which might include obligations like payments or transitions. Also, renewal rights in those contracts would apply. So that's another point where obligations continue.\n\nSection 10.2 Termination for Breach outlines that if there's a material breach, the non-breaching party can terminate, but there's a cure period. If the breaching party is diligently working to fix the breach, the cure period can be extended. This affects post-termination obligations if termination happens due to breach, as there might be a need to resolve the breach even after termination.\n\nSection 3.1 Background IP states that the agreement doesn't grant rights to Background IP except as specified. However, other sections (3.6, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11) survive termination. The survival of these sections means that any obligations outlined in those sections would still apply after termination. For example, if Section 4 deals with payments or IP transfer, those would be in effect post-termination.\n\nThe question also mentions specific areas like transition, payment, transfer of IP, wind-down, last-buy. The context's first paragraph covers returning property (which includes IP transfer), and mentions continuing obligations. The survival clauses in Section 10.1 and the surviving sections (like 3.6, 4, etc.) would cover other obligations. For example, if Section 4 is about payments, those would survive. If Section 6 or",

During the term of the franchise agreement, the franchisee agrees that neither it, its affiliates, nor its owners will have any direct or indirect interest in a \"Competitive Business\" located at the franchise site, within 3 miles of the franchise unit, or within 3 miles of any other Pretzel Time unit in operation or under development (Section 21.A).\n\n2. After termination or expiration of the franchise agreement, the franchisee and its owners agree not to have any direct or indirect interest in a Competitive Business located at the franchise site, within 3 miles of the franchise unit, or within 3 miles of any other Pretzel Time unit in operation or under development for a period of 12 months (Section 20.G).\n\nThe agreement also restricts the franchisee from recruiting or hiring any employees who were employed by Pretzel Time or another Pretzel Time franchisee within the prior 6 months, without Pretzel Time's prior written permission (Section 21.A(2)).\n\nSo in summary, the franchise agreement imposes non-compete and non-solicitation restrictions on the franchisee both during the contract term and for a period after the contract ends.",

The key sections mention that the Franchisee can't use the Marks in certain ways, like signing contracts that would make Pretzel Time liable. There's also a part about not making agreements, warranties, or guarantees on behalf of the other party without written authorization. \n\nThe specific question is about restrictions on soliciting customers or partners.

The context includes parts of a Co-Branding Agreement and an amendment to Section 2 (Term) between PC Quote, Inc. (PCQ) and A.B. Watley, Inc. (ABW).

The Co-Branding Agreement might have such clauses, but the provided context doesn't show them. The answer would depend on whether the Co-Branding Agreement itself includes exclusivity provisions.

(or its subsidiary licensing the software) and the \"Customer\" who is the business entity binding itself to the agreement. The agreement does not mention any third-party beneficiaries who would have rights under the contract.\n\nThe only parties mentioned are Cisco, the Customer, and potentially Government end users who are granted a limited set of rights under the \"Government End User Purchasers\" clause. However, this clause does not appear to confer any enforceable rights to the Government end users beyond the rights already granted to the Customer.\n\nTherefore, the Software License Agreement appears to be solely between Cisco and the contracting Customer, and does not create any rights or ability to enforce the contract for any non-contracting third parties.",

The question is asking whether someone who isn't a party to the contract can still benefit from some clauses and enforce their rights against one of the contracting parties.\n\nLooking at the context provided, the main parties are the Customer and Cisco. The contract mentions that the Customer grants Cisco and its independent accountants the right to examine their books. Then there's the disclaimer of warranty, termination clauses, and some mention of Government end users in 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4. \n\nIn the last part, it says: \"Customer will provide to Government end user, or, if this Agreement is direct Government end user will acquire, the Software and software documentation with only those rights set forth herein that apply to non-governmental customers. Use of this Software and Documentation constitutes agreement by the Government entity that the computer software and Documentation is commercial, and constitutes acceptance of the rights and restrictions herein.\"\n\nSo here, the Government end user is mentioned. Even though the contract is between Customer and Cisco, the Government end user is being given certain rights when they use the software. The key part is that using the software means the Government entity agrees to the rights and restrictions. This suggests that the Government end user, even though not a party to the original contract between Customer and Cisco, is bound by some terms. But does that make them a beneficiary?\n\nWait, being a beneficiary usually means they can enforce the contract against the parties. If the Government end user is required to accept the terms by using the software, maybe they have enforceable rights. For example, if the Customer fails to provide the software correctly to the Government, could the Government step in? But the contract says the Customer provides to the Government end user, so maybe the Government is a third-party beneficiary here. \n\nThird-party beneficiaries are people who aren't parties to the contract but can enforce its terms if the contract was intended to benefit them. The mention that the Government's use constitutes agreement implies that they are intended beneficiaries. The contract is between Customer and Cisco, but the Government is given certain rights when they receive the software. So yes, the Government end user is a non-contracting party who is a beneficiary and can enforce their rights against the Customer or Cisco, depending on the clause.\n\nAnother angle: the contract says that the Government entity's",

The user is asking if there's a clause in the provided context that allows the buyer to get better terms if a third party offers them for the same technology, goods, or services covered by the contract.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the context carefully. The context given is from a contract document, specifically the intellectual property license terms and the return goods policy. The main sections mentioned are about the effective date of the license, termination provisions, SCIEN's rights after termination, and the return goods policy.\n\nLooking at the termination part: If the agreement is terminated, SCIEN can complete existing contracts for the sale of the product within three months, then HEMISPHERX has to buy the remaining stock. The return goods policy mentions that returns outside the policy aren't reimbursed and can be changed without notice. \n\nThe question is about a clause where if a third party offers better terms, the buyer under this contract gets those terms. Commonly, such clauses are called \"most favored nation\" (MFN) clauses. But in the provided text, I don't see any mention of MFN or anything similar. The context doesn't discuss third-party terms or the buyer's entitlement to better terms elsewhere. The focus is on termination rights, return policies, and obligations post-termination. \n\nNo part of the provided text indicates that if a third party gets better terms, the existing buyer would be entitled to those.

There's also a section about the entire agreement and severability.\n\nI don't see any mention of MFN clauses here. The sections don't discuss terms being adjusted based on third-party offers. The Limitation of Liability part specifically caps liability, but that's not related to better terms. The Assignment part is about transferring the agreement, not about terms.

The core fields defined for each party serve to delineate their respective areas of exclusivity, rather than being exceptions or carveouts to a broader non-compete or exclusivity arrangement.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out the answer to this question. The user is asking about a category that includes exceptions or carveouts to Non-Compete, Exclusivity, and No-Solicit of Customers. The context provided is a legal agreement with various sections, so I need to look through the given text to find where these exceptions might be mentioned.\n\nFirst, I'll recall that Non-Compete clauses typically prevent parties from competing with each other in certain areas, Exclusivity might restrict using shared resources in specific ways, and No-Solicit of Customers would prevent one party from taking the other's customers. The question is about exceptions to these restrictions.\n\nLooking through the context, there are several sections mentioned. The user provided parts of the agreement, including sections like 5.7 and 5.8, and some definitions. Let me check each part.\n\nIn Section 5.7, titled \"Restrictions on Licensor Exploitation of Intellectual Property,\" there are clauses where RemainCo and SpinCo are restricted from using each other's licensed intellectual property in specific core fields. For example, RemainCo can't use Licensed RemainCo IP in the SpinCo Core Field, and vice versa. This seems like a Non-Compete type restriction, but maybe there are exceptions here. However, the section doesn't mention exceptions, just the restrictions.\n\nThen there's Section 5.8 about Third Party Agreements and Reservation of Rights. The text provided for Section 5.8 starts but doesn't finish. The mention of \"Reservation of Rights\" might imply that there are exceptions or carveouts where the parties can do things that would otherwise be restricted. However, the given text doesn't show the full content of 5.8, so I can't be sure.\n\nLooking back at the general definitions in the context, part (o) mentions that references to any Person include their successors and assigns if permitted. Also, part (r) says that obligations apply to relevant Subsidiaries and Affiliates. These might relate to how the restrictions apply, but not directly exceptions.\n\nIn the licensing sections (like the part about Foundational Software in the middle), there are licenses granted with specific scopes. For example, RemainCo grants SpinCo certain rights to use Foundational Software, which might be exceptions to other restrictions. But the question is about Non-Compete, Exclusivity, and No-Solicit, not licensing.\n\nWait, the question",

      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, the contract includes provisions that limit the liability of the parties upon a breach of the agreement:\n\n1. Section 14 states: \"It is agreed that no personal liability whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed on or otherwise be incurred by any Partner, agent, management official or employee of the Transporter or any director, officer or employee of any of the foregoing, for any obligation of the Transporter arising under this Agreement or for any claim based on such obligation and that the sole recourse of Shipper under this Agreement is limited to assets of the Transporter.\"\n\nThis provision limits the liability to only the assets of the Transporter, and explicitly states that no personal liability shall be attached to the Transporter's partners, agents, or employees.\n\n2. The contract does not appear to include any time limitations for the counterparty to bring claims or a maximum amount for recovery. The contract states that \"any controversy between the parties arising under this Agreement and not resolved by the parties shall be determined in accordance with the laws of the State of Michigan\", but does not specify any statute of limitations or damage caps.\n\nSo in summary, the contract includes a limitation of liability provision that restricts the recourse of the Shipper to only the assets of the Transporter, but does not appear to include any time limitations or maximum recovery amounts.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the contract includes a cap on liability when a party breaches their obligations. They also mention time limits for claims or maximum recovery amounts.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context for any provisions related to liability. The first section under \"OTHER PROVISIONS\" says that no personal liability shall attach to any Partner, agent, management official, or employee of the Transporter, and that the sole recourse for the Shipper is limited to the Transporter's assets. That sounds like a limitation of liability because it restricts the Shipper's ability to go after individuals or other entities beyond the Transporter's assets. \n\nSo, the key part here is \"the sole recourse of Shipper under this Agreement is limited to assets of the Transporter.\" This means that if there's a breach, the Shipper can only go after the Transporter's assets, not personal assets of individuals associated with the Transporter. That's a form of liability cap because it prevents personal liability beyond the company's assets.\n\nLooking at other sections like RATES, MISCELLANEOUS, and EFFECT ON PREVIOUS CONTRACTS, there's nothing about time limits for claims or maximum monetary caps. The question also asks about time limitations or maximum amounts, but the context doesn't mention any specific time frames or numerical limits. The answer should focus on the limitation of liability to the Transporter's assets as the cap, without mentioning time limits or specific amounts. \n\nTherefore, the answer should confirm that there's a cap on liability by limiting recourse to the Transporter's assets, but there's no mention of time limits or maximum recovery amounts in the provided context.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: Yes, the contract includes a cap on liability. Specifically, it limits the Shipper's recourse to the assets of the Transporter,\u514d\u9664\u4efb\u4f55\u4e0eTransporter\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4e2a\u4eba\u3001\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u3001\u7ba1\u7406\u4eba\u5458\u6216\u5458\u5de5\u7684\u4e2a\u4eba\u8d23\u4efb\u3002 This provision ensures that liability for obligations under the Agreement is restricted to the Transporter's assets, effectively capping potential recovery.

      "ground_truth_answer": "No, there is no clause in this agreement that provides for joint or shared ownership of intellectual property between the parties. This agreement appears to be an endorsement agreement related to a split-dollar life insurance policy and does not mention or discuss any intellectual property.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if there's a clause in the provided context that allows for joint or shared ownership of intellectual property between the parties.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the context given. The context is a legal agreement with several sections. Let me go through each part carefully.\n\nThe first part says, \"Ownership of Policy. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Company shall be the sole and exclusive owner of the Policy.\" So right here, it's clear that the Company has sole ownership of the Policy. The phrase \"sole and exclusive owner\" indicates that there's no joint ownership here. Any exceptions would be mentioned elsewhere in the agreement, but the default is the Company owns it entirely.\n\nNext, there's a section about No Contract of Employment. That's about employment terms, not IP ownership. Then, the part about executing counterparts and facsimile copies. Still not relevant to IP.\n\nThen there's Transfer of Policy and Partial Repayment of Demand Note. This talks about transferring ownership of the Policy from the Trust to the Company in exchange for partial repayment. But again, ownership here is being transferred to the Company, not shared.\n\nThe last part mentions that the terms bind the parties and their successors. Still nothing about joint ownership.\n\nNow, the question is about intellectual property. The context mentions \"Policy\" which might be an insurance policy, not necessarily intellectual property. The ownership clause here is about the Policy, not IP. The agreement doesn't mention anything about patents, copyrights, trademarks, or other IP. The only ownership discussed is the Policy, and that's solely the Company's.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The context doesn't have any clauses about joint or shared ownership of intellectual property. The ownership mentioned is for the Policy, which is a different asset, and it's sole ownership by the Company. There's no mention of IP rights being shared between the parties. Therefore, the answer should be that there's no such clause.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: No, the provided context does not include any clause that provides for joint or shared ownership of intellectual property between the parties. The document explicitly states that the Company is the \"sole and exclusive owner of the Policy,\" and there are no provisions addressing intellectual property rights or shared ownership of such rights. The ownership discussed pertains to the Policy (likely an insurance policy) and not to intellectual property.",

The user is asking about the renewal term after the initial term expires, including automatic extensions and unilateral extensions with prior notice. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the context provided. The context mentions the term of the agreement. The initial term is 1 year from the Effective Date. The key part here is the part about renewal. The agreement says it will renew automatically for successive one-year periods unless either party gives written notice of intent not to renew at least 30 days before the end of the year.\n\nSo, the initial term is one year. After that, it automatically renews for another year each time. But if either Client or TrueLink wants to stop the renewal, they have to send a written notice 30 days before the end of the current term. That means the renewal is automatic unless someone gives notice not to renew. \n\nThe question is about the renewal term. The answer should state that after the initial term, it renews automatically for one-year periods. Also, either party can unilaterally decide not to renew by giving 30 days' notice before the end of the term. So the renewal term is one year, with the option to not renew by giving 30 days notice. \n\nI need to make sure I didn't miss any other conditions. The context also mentions that Sections 2 and 3 terminate promptly under certain breach conditions, but that's about termination, not renewal. The renewal process is separate.

This means the agreement renews automatically unless either Client or TrueLink explicitly opts out by meeting the 30-day notice requirement.

The context is from Article VII, which covers Limitation on Liability and Indemnification. Let me check the sections mentioned here.\n\nSection 7.2 is about Limitation of Liability. The first part talks about what happens if a party believes the other is in material breach. It mentions giving notice, a period to remedy the breach, and if not fixed, escalating to CEO meetings. If unresolved, the non-breaching party can terminate. But the question is about liability caps. The key part here is the last sentence: \"The non-defaulting Party's right to terminate... shall not be construed as an exclusive remedy.\" This suggests that termination is an option but not the only one, so other remedies might still be available. However, this doesn't mention a cap on liability in terms of monetary limits.\n\nThen there's section (a) about Force Majeure Events. It says that if a party can't perform due to events beyond their control, they must notify the other party. If the non-performance lasts too long, the other party can terminate. Again, this is about termination and suspension of obligations, not a cap on liability.\n\nThe question is about a cap on liability, which usually refers to a maximum amount a party can be held responsible for. The provided context doesn't mention any specific monetary limits. The only time limits mentioned are for remedying breaches or terminating after a certain period. There's no mention of a maximum amount for recovery. The term \"exclusive remedy\" is used regarding termination, but that doesn't set a cap on liability. Instead, it means termination is an option but not the only possible remedy.\n\nSo, based on the given text, there's no explicit cap on liability in terms of a maximum amount. The limitations here are procedural (like time to fix breaches) and remedies (like termination). The answer should indicate that there's no cap on liability as per the provided sections. The user might be looking for a clause that limits financial responsibility, but the context doesn't include such a provision. Therefore, the answer is that the contract does not include a cap on liability in terms of maximum recovery amount, though there",

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether one party can terminate the agreement if there's a change of control, like a merger or stock sale, and if the other party needs to consent or be notified.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context. The key sections here are 13.3 and 15.6. \n\nStarting with 13.3: It lists several termination conditions. Specifically, under 13.3, either party can terminate if the other party has a petition filed against them under bankruptcy laws that isn't dismissed within 90 days. Also, if About sells all or substantially all of its assets, or if any entity acquires 50% of the voting stock, then the other party can terminate. However, there's an exception mentioned: the acquisition of About by Primedia doesn't count as grounds for termination. \n\nThen there's a part about ebix being acquired by certain companies (like AOL, Yahoo, etc.), which would allow About to terminate immediately with written notice. So if ebix is acquired by any of those listed entities, About can terminate right away by giving notice. \n\nSo, for a change of control scenario, if it's ebix being acquired by one of those specific companies, About can terminate without needing consent, just by providing written notice. For other scenarios, like About selling assets or being acquired by someone else (not Primedia), the other party can terminate. \n\nLooking at 15.6 about assignments: Neither party can assign the agreement without the other's written consent, except to an affiliate or successor via merger, etc. So if there's a merger or acquisition, the party can assign the agreement without consent. But the termination rights in 13.3 are separate. \n\nSo the answer would be that if ebix is acquired by one of the listed companies, About can terminate immediately upon notice. If About undergoes a change of control (like selling assets or being acquired by someone else not Primedia), then the other party can terminate. In those cases, termination is allowed without the counterparty's consent, but notice is required. Also, if the assignment is done under 15.6 (like to an affiliate), then consent isn't needed for the assignment, but termination rights under 13.3 might still apply depending on the specifics.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: Yes, under certain change-of-control scenarios,",

      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the provided context, this document does not appear to be granting any licenses. It is a Joint Filing Agreement between various Athene and Apollo entities regarding the joint filing of a Statement on Schedule 13D with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The agreement does not mention any licenses or the ability to transfer licenses to third parties. The document is focused on the joint filing of regulatory disclosures and does not contain provisions limiting the transfer of licenses.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the contract limits the ability of a party to transfer the license to a third party. The context provided includes a part about the agreement being executed in counterparts and several authorized signatories from different companies.\n\nFirst, I need to check if there's any mention of transferability or restrictions on transferring the license. The context given is about the execution of the agreement with multiple counterparts and signatures from different entities. However, there's no explicit mention of transfer rights or limitations. The key part here is the sentence: \"This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts each of which shall be deemed to be an original and all of which together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same Agreement.\" This talks about how the agreement can be signed in multiple copies but doesn't address transferring the license to another party.\n\nSince the question is about transferring the license, and the provided context doesn't include any clauses about assignment, transfer restrictions, or similar terms, there's no information to indicate that the contract limits such a transfer. Therefore, based solely on the given context, the answer would be that there's no limitation mentioned. However, it's important to note that in real legal documents, transferability is usually addressed in a specific clause, which isn't present here. But since the user is only providing this context, the answer must be based on what's here.\n</think>\n\nThe provided context does not mention any limitations on transferring the license to a third party. The text focuses on the execution of the agreement in counterparts and the authorization of signatories but does not address transferability or restrictions on assignment. Therefore, **the contract does not explicitly limit the ability to transfer the license** based on the given information. However, in practice, such limitations are often specified in separate clauses (e.g., \"assignment\" or \"transfer\" provisions), which are absent here.",

The user is asking if one party is required to share revenue or profit with the other for any technology, goods, or services based on the provided context.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the context given. The context includes parts of a legal agreement between a Shipper and a Transporter. The sections mentioned are Miscellaneous, Other Provisions, and some signatures. \n\nLooking at the Miscellaneous section: It talks about waivers. If one party doesn't waive a default, it doesn't mean they're waiving future defaults. That doesn't mention revenue sharing.\n\nIn the Other Provisions section, it states that no personal liability is attached to partners or employees of the Transporter.

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether one party is required to share revenue or profit with the counterparty for any technology, goods, or services based on the provided context.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the context carefully. The context is a legal document, likely a contract between the Company, the Trust, and the Remarketing Agent. The sections mentioned are (dd), (ee), (f), and then later sections discussing indemnification and contribution. \n\nLooking at the sections, they talk about the Trust not being a party to other agreements, the Company and Trust having the authority to execute agreements, the validity of the Transaction Agreements, and indemnification obligations. The indemnification sections (Section 7) outline when each party must indemnify the other against losses, claims, etc., arising from untrue statements or omissions in prospectuses or other documents. There's also a contribution clause if indemnification isn't available.\n\nNow, the question is about revenue or profit sharing related to technology, goods, or services. I need to check if any part of the context mentions such obligations. Scanning through the provided text, the main focus is on the execution of agreements, representations, warranties, indemnification, and liability. There's no mention of revenue sharing, profit sharing, or any obligations related to technology, goods, or services beyond the transaction agreements. \n\nThe indemnification clauses are about covering losses from misstatements in documents, not about sharing profits. The parties' obligations are centered around the transactions described in the Prospectus and Transaction Agreements. There's no indication that one party must share revenue or profits with the other for any goods, services, or technology. \n\nTherefore, based on the context provided, the answer should be that there's no requirement for revenue or profit sharing as the question implies. The agreements don't mention such terms.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: No, the context does not indicate that one party is required to share revenue or profit with the counterparty for any technology, goods, or services. The document outlines obligations related to indemnification, representations, warranties, and liability for misstatements in transaction documents, but there is no mention of profit-sharing or revenue-sharing arrangements for technology, goods, or services.

      "ground_truth_answer": "No, the contract does not contain a license granted by one party to its counterparty. The contract is an addendum to a distribution agreement between Zebra Technologies and ScanSource, Inc. and its affiliates. It primarily deals with the addition of Xplore products to the distribution agreement, and the operational terms around ordering, shipping, and returning those Xplore products. There is no mention of any party granting a license to the other.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the contract contains a license granted by one party to the other. First, I need to look through the provided context carefully.\n\nThe context is an addendum to a Distributor Agreement between Zebra, Xplore, and ScanSource Mexico. The main points are that Xplore agrees to be bound by the Distributor Agreement only for selling Xplore Products to the Distributor. It mentions that Xplore doesn't take on any obligations of Zebra except for selling those products. There's a termination clause referencing the Distribution Agreement's terms. \n\nLooking at the WHEREAS clauses, it states that Zebra acquired Xplore on August 14, 2018, and added Xplore Products to their portfolio. Xplore is now a Zebra Affiliate and sells these products. The Distributor wants to buy these products from Xplore under the Distributor Agreement via this Addendum. \n\nNow, the question is about whether there's a license grant. A license typically refers to permission to use intellectual property, like trademarks, patents, or copyrights. The document mentions that Xplore Products are branded as Xplore or Motion Computing. Since Xplore is now a Zebra Affiliate, they might be licensing their branding to Zebra or allowing the Distributor to use it. However, the Addendum's main purpose is to allow the Distributor to purchase and resell Xplore Products. \n\nI don't see explicit language where one party grants a license to the other. The Distributor is authorized to purchase and resell, which is more of a distribution right rather than a license. There's no mention of intellectual property rights being licensed here. The Addendum binds Xplore to the Distributor Agreement for selling products but doesn't state that a license is being granted. \n\nSo, based on the information given, the contract doesn't explicitly mention a license grant. The focus is on distribution rights and obligations related to product sales, not on granting usage rights to intellectual property.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: No, the contract does not contain a license granted by one party to its counterparty. The Addendum authorizes the Distributor to purchase and resell Xplore Products under the terms of the Distributor Agreement, but it does not explicitly grant a license for intellectual property (e.g., trademarks, patents) or other rights beyond distribution.

The user is asking about a category that includes exceptions or carveouts to Non-Compete, Exclusivity, and No-Solicit of Customers. They provided some context from a legal document, specifically an 8-K filing from Artara Therapeutics.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the given context to find any sections that mention exceptions related to those clauses. The user mentioned \"Non-Compete, Exclusivity and No-Solicit of Customers,\" so I should focus on parts of the context that talk about exceptions to these.\n\nLooking at the context, there are several sections. The first part defines \"Net Sales\" with various deductions. Then there's a mention of \"Net Sales\" being determined by GAAP. Then \"Royalty\" is defined. Section 5.2 Exceptions talks about insurance coverage, including product liability, errors and omissions, etc. There's also a definition for \"First Commercial Sale.\"\n\nThe question is about exceptions to Non-Compete, Exclusivity, and No-Solicit. The provided context doesn't explicitly mention Non-Compete or Exclusivity clauses. However, the user might be referring to a different part of the document not included here. But since the answer must be based on the provided context, I need to check if there's any mention of exceptions in the given sections.\n\nLooking at 5.2 Exceptions, it discusses insurance requirements. It lists the types of insurance coverage required, like product liability, contractual liability, clinical trials liability, etc. But this seems unrelated to Non-Compete or Exclusivity. The other sections define terms like Net Sales, Royalty, and First Commercial Sale, which are financial terms.\n\nWait, maybe the user is referring to a different part of the document. The question mentions \"above\" exceptions, implying that there was a previous section discussing Non-Compete, Exclusivity, and No-Solicit. However, in the provided context, those terms aren't present. The only exceptions mentioned are in 5.2 regarding insurance. Since the user is asking for the category that includes exceptions to those clauses, but the context doesn't include those clauses, perhaps the answer is that there's no information provided in the context about such exceptions.

There is no mention of any unlimited or enterprise-level licensing provisions.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if there's a clause in the provided context that grants an \"enterprise,\" \"all you can eat,\" or unlimited usage license. First, I need to understand what these terms mean. An \"enterprise license\" typically allows a company to use software across the entire organization, while \"all you can eat\" might refer to unlimited access or usage. An unlimited usage license would mean there's no cap on how much the party can use the service or product.\n\nLooking at the context provided, it's an amendment to a Supply and Manufacturing Agreement between Cerus Corporation and Porex Corporation. The key sections mentioned are changes to Section 1.3, adding a new Section 1.5.3, and a new Section 3a. The user is asking about a clause that allows unlimited usage. \n\nIn the context, the first amendment deletes the penultimate sentence of Section 1.3 and replaces it with a limit on the number of units that can be ordered in any given period, referred to as \"Porex Capacity Limitations.\" This actually sets a maximum, so it's a restriction rather than an unlimited clause. \n\nThen, Section 1.5.3 talks about invoicing monthly for services and payment terms. It specifies that payment is due [*] days after receipt of the invoice. There's no mention of unlimited usage here; it's about billing and payment terms.\n\nSection 3a is about Non-Production Related Work, which would be additional work orders beyond regular production. The context mentions that a new section titled \"Pricing for Non-Production Related Work Orders from Cerus\" is added to Exhibit D, with pricing agreed upon by both parties. This seems to outline how such work is priced but doesn't indicate unlimited usage.\n\nThe rest of the text discusses the relationship between the Agreement and Statements of Work, stating that the Agreement controls unless the Statement of Work explicitly refers to altering the Agreement. There's no mention of any unlimited license or enterprise-wide usage. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the amendments actually impose limits (like the Porex Capacity Limitations) and set specific terms for invoicing and non-production work. There's no clause that grants unlimited usage or an enterprise license.

      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the information provided in the software development agreement, the notice period required to terminate the agreement without cause is two weeks. \n\nSpecifically, Section 11.1 states:\n\n\"Either Party may terminate this Agreement at any time during the term of this Agreement for any reason upon two weeks written notice to the other Party.\"\n\nSo the agreement can be terminated without cause by either party with two weeks' written notice.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the notice period required to terminate renewal. Hmm, first I need to look through the provided context to find any mention of termination and renewal.\n\nLooking at the sections given, there's Section 11.1 which talks about termination without cause. It says either party can terminate with two weeks written notice. Then there's 11.2 for termination for cause, which is immediate upon notice if certain conditions are met. \n\nThe question is about terminating a renewal. Wait, the context doesn't explicitly mention a renewal clause. The term of the agreement is until completion or termination of services as per the Project. The notice period for termination without cause is two weeks. Since the user is asking about termination of renewal, maybe they mean terminating the agreement before it renews? But the context doesn't specify a separate notice period for renewals. The general termination without cause is two weeks. \n\nI need to check if there's any mention of renewal in the provided sections. The sections given are 11.1, 11.2, 11.3, 12.2, and some other parts. Nowhere does it mention a specific notice period for termination of a renewal. The standard termination without cause is two weeks. So perhaps the answer is two weeks, as per 11.1. The user might be conflating termination with renewal, but since the context doesn't have a specific renewal notice period beyond the standard termination, the answer would be based on 11.1.\n</think>\n\nThe notice period required to terminate the agreement without cause is **two weeks** written notice to the other party, as specified in Section 11.1 of the Agreement. The context does not explicitly mention a separate \"notice period for termination of renewal,\" but the general termination provisions (Section 11.1) apply to all terminations, including scenarios where a renewal might be involved. Thus, the standard two-week notice applies. \n\n**Answer:** The notice period required to terminate is two weeks written notice to the other party.",

      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, the contract contains a license grant that is irrevocable and perpetual.

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the contract contains a license grant that's irrevocable or perpetual. I need to look through the provided context to find any mentions of such terms.\n\nFirst, I'll start by scanning the sections mentioned. The context includes parts from the CARDLYTICS, INC., S-1 filing. Looking at section 2.0 LICENSE, specifically 2.1: \"Supplier hereby grants Bank of America a nonexclusive, worldwide, irrevocable, perpetual license...\" There it is! The words \"irrevocable\" and \"perpetual\" are right there. \n\nWait, the question is asking if there's a license grant that is either irrevocable or perpetual. Since the license here is both, that definitely answers the question. But I should check if there are any conditions or exceptions. The license is granted under the terms of the agreement and any special terms in the Product License Schedule. However, the key part here is that the license is described as irrevocable and perpetual. \n\nLooking further, there's also mention in 5.5 about licenses not terminating unless the Supplier terminates the Product License Schedule due to non-payment. But the main grant in 2.1 is explicitly perpetual and irrevocable. So even if other sections talk about termination under certain conditions, the initial grant itself is stated as irrevocable and perpetual. \n\nI need to make sure there's no conflicting information. For example, sometimes contracts have clauses that allow termination for cause. But the question is about the existence of an irrevocable or perpetual license grant. Since the grant itself is labeled as such, even if there are termination clauses, the grant's terms are still as stated. \n\nSo the answer should be yes, based on section 2.1 where the license is explicitly described as irrevocable and perpetual.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: Yes, the contract contains a license grant that is both **irrevocable** and **perpetual**. Specifically, Section 2.1 of the agreement states that Supplier grants Bank of America a \"nonexclusive, worldwide, **irrevocable, perpetual** license to install, use, execute, and copy the Software\" as necessary to conduct Bank of America's business.

Consent or notice to the counterparty would likely be required for any such change.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether one party can terminate the agreement if there's a change of control, like a merger or asset sale, or if they need the other party's consent or notice.\n\nLooking at the provided context, the first section is about Assignment. It says that neither party can assign, transfer, or sublicense their rights without the other's express prior written consent. So if a company is acquired or merges, that would typically involve assigning the agreement. The Assignment clause here requires consent, so that's a key point.\n\nThen there's the Confidentiality section, which talks about using information only for the agreement's purposes and not disclosing it without consent. But that's more about handling confidential info rather than termination or assignment.\n\nThe General Provisions include Warranties and Notice. The Warranties part mentions compliance with laws and good faith, but nothing about termination. The Notice section says how notices should be given, but again, not directly about termination on change of control.\n\nThe question is about termination rights upon a change of control. The Assignment clause requires consent for any assignment, which would include a change of control scenario. However, the question is about termination. The context doesn't mention a specific termination clause triggered by change of control. So if a party undergoes a change of control, the other party isn't automatically allowed to terminate unless the assignment is prohibited. But since assignment requires consent, maybe the party undergoing the change of control can't assign the agreement without consent, but the other party can't terminate unless the agreement allows it. The context doesn't specify a termination right for the other party in such cases. Therefore, the answer would be that consent is required for assignment, but there's no mention of termination rights. So the answer is that consent is required, and termination isn't addressed here.\n</think>\n\nThe provided context does not explicitly address termination rights in the event of a change of control (e.g., merger, asset sale, or assignment by operation of law). However, the **Assignment** clause states that neither party may assign, transfer, or sublicense rights under the Agreement without the **express prior written consent** of the other party. This implies that a change of control (which typically involves assignment or transfer) would require the counterparty\u2019s consent. \n\nThere is no mention of automatic termination rights for either party in such scenarios. Therefore, **consent is required** for any assignment or transfer arising from a change of control",

      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, based on the information provided in the contract, there is a non-contracting party that is a beneficiary to some of the clauses and can therefore enforce its rights against a contracting party.\n\nSpecifically, the contract mentions \"Replacement Supplier\" in several clauses, such as Clauses 17, 18, 19, and 20. These clauses indicate that the Replacement Supplier, even though not an original contracting party, will have certain rights and obligations relevant to the termination of the agreement and the transfer of the maintenance services.\n\nFor example, Clause 18.2 states that \"DCL shall procure the transfer of the Management Services either from SEV to DCL or from SEV to any Replacement Supplier.\" This suggests that the Replacement Supplier can enforce its right to have the maintenance services transferred to it upon termination of the agreement.\n\nAdditionally, Clause 20 outlines the rights and obligations of DCL, SEV, and the Replacement Supplier in the event that the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations apply to the termination of the agreement. This further indicates that the Replacement Supplier has enforceable rights under the contract.\n\nTherefore, based on the provisions in the contract, the Replacement Supplier appears to be a non-contracting party that can nonetheless enforce certain rights against the contracting parties, SEV and DCL.",

The user is asking whether a non-contracting party (someone not a party to the agreement) can be a beneficiary to some or all of the clauses and thus enforce rights against a contracting party.\n\nLooking at the context provided, the first section under \"Third party rights\" says that a person not a party to the Agreement can't enforce any term under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999. But it also mentions that this doesn't affect any rights or remedies a third party might have apart from that Act. So, the general rule here is that third parties can't enforce the contract terms unless there's an exception elsewhere.\n\nNow, I need to check if any other clauses in the context provide a way for a third party to have enforceable rights. Let's go through the other sections. \n\nSection 13.7 talks about liability for death or injury due to negligence or fraud. That's about the parties' liability, not third parties' rights. \n\nSections 32.2 to 32.5 discuss rights and remedies being cumulative, not exclusive, and about waivers. These are procedural and don't mention third parties. \n\nThe \"Assignment and sub-contractors\" section (26.1-26.4) deals with assignment and sub-contracting. It says SEV can sub-contract with DCL's consent and remains responsible for their agents/sub-contractors. However, there's no mention of third parties being beneficiaries here. The consent requirements are about the parties (SEV and DCL) allowing sub-contracting, but the sub-contractors themselves aren't given any rights to enforce against the parties. \n\nSection 24.2 is about termination due to force majeure and doesn't involve third parties.\n\nSo, based on the context, the only relevant part is the first one about third-party rights. The contract explicitly states that third parties can't enforce terms under the 1999 Act. There's no other clause in the provided context that allows a third party to enforce any part of the agreement. Therefore, the answer should be no, unless there's a specific provision outside the given context that allows it, but based on what's provided, the answer is no.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: No. The contract explicitly states that a person who is not a party to the Agreement cannot enforce any term of the Agreement",

There is no provision in the agreement that states the intellectual property rights to the Titles will transfer to the Licensee upon the occurrence of certain events. \n\n4. The agreement states that Sections 2(a), 2(b), 2(c), 2(d), 3, and 11 shall survive the expiration or termination of the agreement (Section 7(c)). This indicates the Licensor retains ownership of the intellectual property rights even after the agreement ends.\n\nSo in summary, the intellectual property rights to the Titles remain the property of the Licensor throughout the term of the agreement and beyond, and do not become the property of the Licensee under the terms of this contract.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether intellectual property created by one party becomes the property of the counterparty, either through the contract terms or certain events. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context to see if there's any mention of ownership transfer of intellectual property. The context is a contract between a Licensor and Licensee. \n\nLooking at the sections given, there's a part about indemnification and limitation of liability, but the key part might be in the representation and warranty section. The last paragraph mentions that the Licensor has all rights and authority to perform its obligations and grant rights under the Agreement, but it excludes non-dramatic performing rights controlled by SESAC, ASCAP, or BMI. \n\nThe main question is about ownership transfer. The contract states that the Licensor licenses video programming to the Licensee. Licensing typically means granting usage rights without transferring ownership. There's no explicit clause stating that IP created by one party becomes the other's. The contract allows assignments to affiliates with consent, but that's about transferring the agreement, not the IP itself.\n\nThe Limitation of Liability section doesn't address ownership. The Indemnification part is about financial responsibility, not IP ownership. The assignment clause allows for assignment of rights under the agreement but again, not the underlying IP. \n\nSince there's no mention of work-made-for-hire, assignment of future IP, or any other terms that would transfer ownership, it seems the IP remains with the original creator. The contract is a licensing agreement, not an assignment. Therefore, the answer would be no, unless there's a specific clause I missed. But based on the provided context, there's no indication that IP becomes the counterparty's property.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: No, intellectual property created by one party does not become the property of the counterparty under the terms of the provided contract. The agreement describes a licensing arrangement where the Licensor grants the Licensee rights to use certain video programming, but there is no explicit provision transferring ownership of intellectual property (IP) to the counterparty. The contract includes representations about the Licensor\u2019s rights to grant licenses but does not state that IP created by either party becomes the property of the other. Ownership of IP remains with the original creator unless otherwise agreed in a separate assignment, which is not indicated here. The document also allows for permitted assignments of the agreement itself (e.g., to affiliates or subsidiaries with consent) but does",

      "ground_truth_answer": "No, the party's liability is not uncapped upon breach of the contract. The agreement contains specific limitations on liability:\n\n1. Section 10.4(a) limits the aggregate liability of each party in any 12-month period to 1.5 times the aggregate amounts paid or payable by Customer to Manufacturer during the preceding 12-month period, solely with respect to the affected products for which the liability arose.\n\n2. Section 10.4(b) specifically provides that neither party shall be liable for consequential, special, incidental or indirect damages, lost revenue or profits, etc., except in certain enumerated cases, such as a breach of the confidentiality obligations under Section 13.\n\nSo the agreement does not provide for uncapped liability upon breach. The liability is limited in the ways specified in Section 10.4.\n\nThe only exceptions are for certain types of breaches, such as:\n\n- Breaches of the confidentiality obligations under Section 13\n- Gross negligence, fraud or willful misconduct of a party\n- Willful breach of the agreement\n- Indemnification obligations under Sections 10.1 and 10.2 for third-party claims\n\nIn these cases, the limitations on liability in Section 10.4 do not apply. But otherwise, the parties' liability is subject to the caps and limitations outlined in Section 10.4.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether a party's liability is uncapped when they breach their contract obligations, specifically mentioning IP infringement or confidentiality breaches. I need to look at the provided context to find the answer.\n\nFirst, I'll recall the sections mentioned. The context includes sections about indemnification and limitations of liability. The key parts are in (a) and (b) of the Limitations of Liability section. \n\nIn section (a), there's a cap on liability for most cases. It says that except for certain exceptions, each party's liability is limited to 1.5 times the amount paid for the affected products in the past 12 months. The exceptions listed include gross negligence, fraud, willful misconduct, willful breach, breach of Section 13, and customer liabilities under 2.5(e). So, if a breach falls under these exceptions, the cap doesn't apply.\n\nLooking at section (b), it explicitly excludes certain damages like consequential, special, or punitive damages unless they fall under the same exceptions. So, if the breach is something like IP infringement (which might be covered under the indemnification sections 10.1 or 10.2), then the liability isn't capped. But if it's a regular breach without those exceptions, the cap applies.\n\nNow, the user is asking about IP infringement. In the indemnification sections (10.1 and 10.2), there are clauses where each party indemnifies the other for third-party claims related to IP infringement. For example, Manufacturer has to cover if their unauthorized changes lead to IP issues, while Customer might be responsible if they approved changes that caused infringement. These would fall under the exceptions in the liability cap, meaning those specific breaches (like IP infringement) aren't subject to the 1.5x cap. \n\nConfidentiality breaches aren't explicitly mentioned here, but if they fall under gross negligence, fraud, or willful misconduct, then they would also be uncapped. However, if it's a regular breach without those factors, the cap would apply.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the liability is capped in most cases except for specific breaches like those involving gross negligence, fraud, willful misconduct, or specific indemnification obligations. Therefore, for IP infringement (if covered under the indemnification clauses) and breaches involving the mentioned exceptions, the liability is uncapped. Otherwise, it's capped at",

Limitation of Liability: Section 12.2 states that \"IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING ANY LOST PROFITS, LOST REVENUES OR LOST SAVINGS, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT AND/OR THE PRODUCTS, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF THE PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED, KNOWS OR SHOULD KNOW, OR IS OTHERWISE AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\" This caps the liability to direct damages only.\n\n2. Time Limitation to Bring Claims: The contract does not explicitly state a time limitation for bringing claims. However, Section 14.3 states that if a party defaults or breaches the agreement, the non-defaulting party must give written notice and the defaulting party has 15 days to cure the breach before the agreement can be terminated. This suggests the parties have at least 15 days to bring a claim for breach before the agreement can be terminated.\n\n3. Maximum Recovery Amount: The contract does not specify a maximum recovery amount for damages. It only limits the types of damages that can be recovered (i.e. no indirect, special, incidental, etc. damages).\n\nIn summary, the contract includes a limitation on liability for certain types of damages, but does not explicitly state a time limitation for bringing claims or a maximum recovery amount.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the contract includes a cap on liability when a party breaches their obligations. They also want to know if there's a time limit for the other party to bring claims or a maximum amount for recovery.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context for any mentions of liability caps. The context has sections on Indemnity and Liability (12.1 and 12.2) and Expiry or Termination (14.1-14.5). \n\nStarting with Section 12.2: It says that except for claims under 12.1, neither party is liable for indirect, special, incidental, exemplary, punitive, or consequential damages. This includes lost profits, revenues, or savings. So this part is about excluding certain types of damages, but does it set a cap? Well, excluding some damages might limit liability, but a cap usually refers to a maximum amount. The exclusion here is about the types of damages, not a monetary limit. \n\nLooking elsewhere in the document, there's mention of termination for breach and cure periods (15 days), but nothing about a maximum amount one can claim. The indemnification in 12.1 requires the breaching party to cover losses, damages, etc., but again, no cap is specified. \n\nThe context also mentions that neither party is liable for delays due to force majeure events. However, that's about excusing performance, not limiting liability amounts. \n\nIn the Expiry or Termination sections, there's a mention of Newegg remaining responsible for the Sponsorship Fee if they breach during the first two years, but again, no cap on the total amount. It's about ongoing payment obligations, not a maximum limit.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The contract excludes certain types of damages (like consequential damages) which limits the scope of recoverable damages, but there's no explicit cap on the total amount that can be claimed. There's also no time limit mentioned for bringing claims beyond the cure periods for breaches. The cure periods (15 days) are about when the non-breaching party can terminate, not about when claims must be filed. Therefore, the answer should state that there's no cap on liability in terms of maximum amount, but there are exclusions on certain damages types. Also, no time limit for claims beyond the cure periods.\n</think>\n\nThe contract does not",

Specifically:\n\n1. The provisions of Article 7 (Limited Source Code License and Protection) survive the termination or expiration of the agreement, as stated in Section 9.4.\n\n2. The confidentiality obligations under Article 12 survive for 5 years after the disclosure of the confidential information, as stated in Section 12.5.\n\n3. The model end-user license agreement in Exhibit D states that the provisions in paragraphs 1 through 6 of that agreement shall survive the termination or expiration of the end-user license.\n\nSo even after the overall agreement terminates or expires, the parties remain subject to certain ongoing obligations, particularly around protecting the confidentiality and intellectual property rights related to the licensed technology.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether a party is still subject to obligations after the termination or expiration of a contract, specifically mentioning post-termination things like transition, payments, IP transfer, wind-down, last-buy, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the provided context. The context mentions that certain articles (7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14) survive any termination or expiration. Also, the first sentence says that the provisions of the Article (paragraphs 1-6) survive termination. Then there's a section about default and termination if not corrected within 30 days. \n\nThe key part here is the survival clauses. The question is about whether obligations exist post-termination. The context lists several articles that survive, which likely include obligations related to transition, payments, IP, etc. For example, articles like 7.2-7.4 might cover assignment and successors, which would relate to transfers. Articles 8-14 could include terms about termination, which might address wind-down or last-buy provisions.\n\nThe context also states that the agreement is binding on successors and assigns, which implies that even after termination, certain obligations might carry over. Additionally, the assignment clause mentions that rights can be assigned with consent, which could tie into post-termination transfers.\n\nSo, putting it together, the answer should be yes, because the survival clauses in the context indicate that specific articles (which likely cover those post-termination obligations) remain in effect after termination. The mention of \"survive any termination or expiration\" directly addresses that these provisions, including any transition or payment terms, still apply.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: Yes, a party remains subject to obligations after termination or expiration of the contract. The context explicitly states that certain articles (7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 8\u201314) and provisions (e.g., paragraphs 1\u20136 of the referenced Article) \"survive any termination or expiration\" of the Agreement. These surviving provisions likely include post-termination commitments such as transition arrangements, payments, IP transfers, wind-down obligations, or other similar terms. Additionally, the Agreement\u2019s binding effect on successors and assigns further reinforces that obligations persist post-termination where explicitly stated in the surviving clauses.",

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if there's a clause in the provided context that grants an \"enterprise,\" \"all you can eat,\" or unlimited usage license. First, I need to understand what these terms mean. An \"enterprise license\" typically allows a company to use software across all its departments, while \"all you can eat\" might refer to a broad, unrestricted license. Unlimited usage would mean no restrictions on how much or how the license is used.\n\nLooking at the context provided, there are several sections about licenses. The first part mentions Janssen obtaining a license from a third party if needed for commercializing the product. It states that Janssen is responsible for the costs and that the Company must cooperate. But this seems specific to a particular situation where a third party claims infringement, not a general unlimited license.\n\nThen there's the definition of \"License Agreement\" in 1.57, which refers to a specific collaboration and license agreement from 2008. This is about Janssen getting a license under certain patents for the product. It's a specific license tied to the Product, not an open-ended or unlimited one.\n\nFurther down, there are restrictions on the Company regarding competing products and not commercializing them without consent. Also, clauses about not disparaging the Product. These are more about limitations rather than granting broad usage rights.\n\nI don't see any language that suggests an enterprise-wide or unlimited license. The licenses mentioned are conditional, specific to certain scenarios (like third-party claims), or tied to the Product. There's no mention of an \"all you can eat\" type of license where usage is unrestricted beyond the specified terms. The focus is on responsibilities and restrictions rather than granting broad usage rights. So the answer would be no, there's no such clause here.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: No, the provided context does not include a clause granting an \"enterprise,\" \"all you can eat,\" or unlimited usage license. The agreements specify limited, conditional licenses tied to specific scenarios (e.g., third-party intellectual property disputes, the 2008 Collaboration and License Agreement for the Product, or restrictions on competing products).

The question is about termination, so I should check the \"TERM OF THE AGREEMENT AND TERMINATION\" section, which is section 7. \n\nLooking at 7.1, it says that the Initial Term is 24 months and it automatically extends for an additional half a year unless either party gives written notice of termination at least 60 days prior to the end of the period. So, the notice period here is 60 days. \n\nI need to confirm if there's any other part of the contract that might mention a different notice period. Checking sections 7.2, 7.3, and 7.4, they discuss cancellation due to breach, but not the notice period for termination upon renewal. \n\nAppendix 2 also has some terms, but the key part is in 7.1. The answer should be 60 days as per 7.1. The user is asking specifically about terminating the renewal, which refers to ending the contract before it automatically renews. Therefore, the notice period is 60 days prior to the end of the current term.\n</think>\n\nThe notice period required to terminate the renewal of the agreement is **60 days**. According to **Section 7.1**, either party must provide written notification of termination at least 60 days prior to the end of the current term (or any automatic extension period) to prevent renewal.",

I need to check the provided context for any mention of licensing.\n\nLooking through the sections, there's a section 8 about Assignment. It mentions that the Agreement is binding on the parties and their successors and assigns. But it also says that no rights or obligations can be assigned without prior written consent from the other party. However, there's an exception where either party can assign the Agreement to an affiliated entity without consent. The term \"Licensee's Subscriber accounts\" is mentioned in the Assignment section, which might relate to licensing.\n\nSection 4 talks about KCI's responsibilities, including marketing a Private Labeled Service.

The Assignment section (8) allows assignment to affiliated entities, but that's about transferring the agreement, not necessarily a license. The term \"Licensee\" is mentioned in section 8, but the main question is whether there's a license grant. The context doesn't have a section explicitly titled \"License,\" but maybe there's an implied license through the terms. For example, if KCI is allowed to use Provider's services to offer Private Labeled Service, that might be a license. However, the provided context doesn't have a clear clause stating a license grant. The Assignment section refers to Licensee's Subscriber accounts, which suggests that there's a Licensee involved, but the actual grant of license isn't detailed here. The answer might be that the contract does not explicitly contain a license grant as per the provided sections. The user needs to check if the license is mentioned elsewhere, but based on the given context, it's not present.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: The contract does not explicitly contain a license grant to a licensee (including sublicensor) and their affiliates within the provided sections. While Section 8 (\"ASSIGNMENT\") references \"Licensee's Subscriber accounts,\" it focuses on assignment restrictions and exceptions rather than granting a license. Other sections (e.g., KCI's responsibilities, proprietary information, and consideration) do not detail a formal license grant.

The only requirement is the prior written consent for Distributor to assign the agreement.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking whether consent or notice is required if the contract is assigned to a third party. The context provided is from a Distributor Agreement, specifically sections about assignment and confidentiality.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the part about assignment. The first sentence says, \"This Agreement is not assignable by Distributor without prior written consent of Tripath, which will not be unreasonably withheld. Tripath is free to assign this contract without Distributor's consent.\" So, if the Distributor wants to assign the agreement to someone else, they need Tripath's written consent. But Tripath can assign the contract without asking the Distributor. So, for assignment, the Distributor needs consent, and Tripath doesn't. \n\nThe question is about either party assigning the contract. So if Tripath assigns, they don't need the Distributor's consent. But if the Distributor does, they need Tripath's. Also, the question is about whether consent or notice is required. The answer here seems to be that for the Distributor, consent is required. For Tripath, no consent is needed. But the question is general, not specifying which party. However, the answer should cover both scenarios. \n\nWait, the question is phrased as \"if the contract is assigned to a third party\"\u2014so it's about either party assigning. So the answer would be that if the Distributor assigns, they need Tripath's consent. If Tripath assigns, they don't need the Distributor's consent. Therefore, the answer is that consent is required if the Distributor is assigning, but not if Tripath is. However, the question is asking if consent or notice is required in general. The answer would need to state both cases. \n\nBut maybe the question is just asking if there's a requirement for either party. The answer would be that the Distributor needs consent, and Tripath does not. So the answer is yes, consent is required for the Distributor's assignment, but not for Tripath's. Therefore, the answer is that consent is required if the Distributor assigns, but not if Tripath does.

      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, the contract includes clauses related to joint or shared ownership of intellectual property between the parties:\n\n1. Content Ownership and License (Section 12):\n   - Application Provider will retain all right, title and interest in and to the e-centives Content worldwide.\n   - Excite@Home will retain all right, title, and interest in and to the Excite Network worldwide.\n   - Application Provider grants Excite@Home a royalty-free, non-exclusive, worldwide license to use, reproduce, distribute, transmit and publicly display the e-centives Content.\n\n2.

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if there's a clause in the provided contract that allows for joint or shared ownership of intellectual property between the parties. \n\nFirst, I need to go through the context given. The context includes several sections from the agreement between INVENDA CORP and another party, likely Excite@Home. Let me break down the relevant parts.\n\nLooking at the first part of the context: \"The parties' respective ownership shall be subject to the restrictions set forth in this Agreement.\" It mentions that they are independent contractors and there's no partnership or agency. So, this part is more about their relationship structure rather than ownership of IP.\n\nThen, under section iii) about Transactional Data, it says, \"Transactional Data, when available, shall be jointly owned by the parties...\" So here, it's clear that Transactional Data is jointly owned. However, there's an exception if the Application Provider's contracts with merchants prevent sharing. Also, the Application Provider must use commercially reasonable efforts to allow sharing. This seems like a specific case of joint ownership for Transactional Data.\n\nNext, in section 12, part a) states that the Application Provider retains all rights to e-centives Content, giving Excite@Home a license to use it. Part b) says Excite@Home owns the Excite Network. So, these are cases where each party owns their own IP, not jointly.\n\nThe question is about any clause allowing joint ownership. The key part is in the Transactional Data section (iii) where it explicitly states joint ownership. The other sections don't mention joint ownership except for that specific data. \n\nI need to confirm if Transactional Data is considered intellectual property here. Transactional Data might be data generated from their services, which could be considered IP. The question is about IP ownership, and since Transactional Data is jointly owned, that would be the relevant clause. \n\nSo the answer should point to section iii) where Transactional Data is jointly owned, except when contractual agreements prevent it. The other parts of the agreement don't mention joint ownership beyond that.\n</think>\n\nYes, there is a clause providing for joint ownership of intellectual property in specific circumstances. Under the section addressing **Transactional Data**, it states:  \n\n> \"Transactional Data, when available, shall be jointly owned by the parties, except in those cases where Application Provider's contractual agreement(s) with its merchant partner(s) prevent the sharing of",

There is no provision in the contract that indicates the license grant would continue beyond the Contract Period or be irrevocable.

The contract period is three years unless terminated earlier. The license grant is for that specific period. There's no mention of the license being irrevocable or perpetual. In fact, the contract can be terminated, and the rights are limited to the Contract Period. Also, the Company has to conform to quality standards and provide samples annually. If they don't meet those standards, the NFLA might have grounds to terminate. So, the license isn't perpetual because it's time-bound and conditional.

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking for the date of the contract based on the provided context. Let me look through the document carefully.\n\nFirst, the context mentions that the agreement is executed by the parties' duly elected officers as of the day and year first above written. But where is that date mentioned? The main body talks about the term starting with the first race of the 1998 Winston Cup season and ending with the final race of the 2000 season. However, the actual signing date isn't explicitly stated here. Wait, the installments start in 1998, but the contract's effective date might be earlier. The problem is that the document says \"as of the day and year first above written,\" which usually refers to a date written at the beginning of the contract. But in the provided context, there's no visible date at the start. The user might have omitted it. Alternatively, maybe the term start date is the first race of 1998, but that's not the signing date. Since the contract is signed before the term begins, the actual signing date would be before the first race of 1998. However, without the exact date mentioned in the document, the answer might be that the date isn't specified. Wait, but maybe the \"day and year first above written\" is part of the standard contract language, implying that the date is present in the original document but not included here. Since the user's context doesn't show that date, perhaps the answer is that the date isn't provided in the given context. Alternatively, maybe the term start date is considered the contract date, but that's not necessarily the case. Contracts are usually signed before they take effect. So, since the context doesn't include the actual signing date, the answer would be that the date isn't specified here.\n</think>\n\nThe date of the contract is not explicitly stated in the provided context.

      "question": "Does intellectual property created\u00a0 by one party become the property of the counterparty, either per the terms of the contract or upon the occurrence of certain events?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the information provided in the software license and maintenance agreement, the intellectual property created by one party (D2 Technologies) does not become the property of the counterparty (Summa Four Inc. or LICENSEE) either per the terms of the contract or upon the occurrence of certain events. \n\nThe key points are:\n\n1. Ownership of Licensed Technology:\n   - Section 2.1 states that \"Subject to the rights granted to LICENSEE in this Agreement, D2 owns all right, title and interest in and to the Licensed Technology.\"\n   - LICENSEE is granted a license to use the Licensed Technology, but does not acquire ownership of it.\n\n2. Modifications by LICENSEE:\n   - Section 2.1 states that \"LICENSEE shall retain all right, title and interest in and to modifications to the Licensed Source Code made by LICENSEE pursuant to the license in Article 2.2 below, subject always to D2's ownership rights in the underlying Licensed Technology.\"\n   - This means that while LICENSEE can make modifications, the underlying Licensed Technology remains the property of D2.\n\n3. Source Code Access Conditions:\n   - Section 7.2 outlines certain \"Source Code Access Conditions\" under which LICENSEE can access the Licensed Source Code.\n   - However, even in these scenarios, LICENSEE does not acquire ownership of the Licensed Source Code. It can only use it for the purposes specified in Section 7.3.\n\nIn summary, the agreement does not transfer the intellectual property rights of the Licensed Technology from D2 to LICENSEE, either automatically or upon certain conditions being met. The Licensed Technology remains the property of D2 throughout the agreement.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether intellectual property created by one party becomes the property of the other party under the contract or certain events. I need to look through the provided context to find any clauses that address ownership transfer of IP.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the sections mentioned. The context includes confidentiality terms (Article 12), indemnification (D2's obligation), warranties, and some parts about returning Confidential Information. \n\nLooking at the indemnification part, D2 agrees to hold LICENSEE harmless for third-party IP claims, but that's about liability, not ownership. The warranties mention that D2 isn't aware of any infringement, but again, not about ownership transfer.\n\nIn the section about Licensed Technology, there's a part where if the Licensed Technology is found to infringe, D2 can replace or modify it. But that's about handling infringement, not transferring ownership. \n\nThen there's a line: \"LICENSEE's Customer agrees that D2 or LICENSEE retain the entire right and title to Licensed Technology.\" This seems important. It states that the Customer doesn't get ownership; D2 or LICENSEE keep the rights. \n\nAlso, in the confidentiality section, there's mention of returning Confidential Information upon termination, but that's about returning what was received, not about creating new IP. \n\nThe question is about IP created by one party becoming the other's property. The contract doesn't mention anything about new IP created during the agreement. The existing Licensed Technology's ownership remains with D2 or LICENSEE. There's no clause stating that if a party creates new IP during the agreement, it transfers to the other. \n\nSo based on the provided context, the answer would be no. The contract doesn't provide for the created IP to become the counterparty's property. The existing Licensed Tech's ownership stays with D2 or LICENSEE, but there's no mention of new IP creation leading to ownership transfer. The user's question is about IP created by one party, but the context doesn't address that scenario. Therefore, the answer is no, unless there's a specific event mentioned, which there isn't here.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: No, intellectual property created by one party does not become the property of the counterparty under the terms of the provided contract. The agreement explicitly states that **D2 or LICENSEE retain the entire right and title to the Licensed Technology**, and there are no provisions indicating that new intellectual property created",

The context given is from a document that mentions \"RELATIONSHIP OF THE PARTIES/INDEMNIFICATION\" and lists several terms like \"PRINCIPAL OWNER,\" \"OTHER OWNERS,\" \"DESIGNATED PRINCIPAL OWNERS,\" \"UNIT AND MANAGER,\" \"SUPERVISING OWNERS,\" and \"INITIAL CAPITALIZATION.\" \n\nFirst, I need to identify which of these terms refer to the parties involved in the contract. The question is asking for the names of the parties that signed the agreement. The context seems to be part of a legal document, possibly a partnership or business agreement.\n\nLooking at the terms listed under the \"RELATIONSHIP OF THE PARTIES/INDEMNIFICATION\" section, the first line after the section title lists several roles: PRINCIPAL OWNER, OTHER OWNERS, DESIGNATED PRINCIPAL OWNERS, UNIT AND MANAGER, SUPERVISING OWNERS, and INITIAL CAPITALIZATION. These are likely the different parties involved. \n\nHowever, \"INITIAL CAPITALIZATION\" might be a financial term rather than a party. The other terms like \"PRINCIPAL OWNER,\" \"OTHER OWNERS,\" \"DESIGNATED PRINCIPAL OWNERS,\" \"UNIT AND MANAGER,\" and \"SUPERVISING OWNERS\" all sound like roles or entities that would be parties to a contract. \n\nThe answer should list these as the parties. The user might be expecting a concise list of the parties mentioned. Also, the context includes section numbers like 21.A and 23.C, but the main focus is on the names of the parties. \n\nI need to make sure that \"UNIT AND MANAGER\" is considered a single party or two separate ones. The way it's written with \"AND\" might mean they are a combined entity. So the answer would list each of these roles as separate parties. \n\nTherefore, the answer should include all the listed roles except possibly \"INITIAL CAPITALIZATION\" if it's not a party. But the user might want all the terms mentioned. However, since the question is about the parties who signed the contract, \"INITIAL CAPITALIZATION\" might not be a party but a financial term.

Specifically:\n\nSection 20 \"Limitation of Liability\" states:\n\na) Neither party will have liability for any damages other than direct damages. In no event will either party be liable to the other for any special, incidental or consequential damages, whether based on breach of contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise, whether or not that party has been advised of the possibility of such damage.\n\nb) Either party's liability for damages shall be limited to the amounts actually paid by the other party.\n\nSo the contract limits the parties' liability to only direct damages, and caps the maximum recovery at the amounts actually paid by the other party. There is no time limitation specified for bringing claims.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the contract includes a cap on liability for a party's breach, specifically looking for a time limit for claims or a maximum recovery amount.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context. The context includes sections on Limitation of Liability and Confidentiality. The Limitation of Liability section is probably where the answer lies.\n\nLooking at part a) of the Limitation of Liability: It says neither party is liable for damages other than direct damages. So they exclude special, incidental, or consequential damages. That's a common way to cap liability by limiting the types of damages recoverable. \n\nThen part b) states that each party's liability for damages is limited to the amounts actually paid by the other. So if one party paid $10,000 to the other, the maximum they could get in damages is $10,000. That's a clear cap on the maximum amount recoverable. \n\nThe question also mentions time limitations for bringing claims. However, in the provided context, I don't see any mention of a time limit (like a statute of limitations). The Limitation of Liability section doesn't specify a time frame within which claims must be brought. The other sections, like Confidentiality, don't mention time limits either. \n\nSo the cap on liability is present in two ways: excluding certain types of damages and capping the amount to what was paid. But there's no time limit mentioned for bringing claims. The answer should reflect that there's a cap on the maximum amount (part b) but no time limitation specified here.\n</think>\n\nThe contract includes a cap on liability for breaches of obligations. Specifically, **each party's liability for damages is limited to the amounts actually paid by the other party** (as stated in section b) of the \"LIMITATION OF LIABILITY\" clause). This creates a **maximum monetary cap** on recovery, tied to the payments made under the agreement. \n\nHowever, the contract **does not explicitly specify a time limitation** for the counterparty to bring claims. While the Limitation of Liability section restricts the types of recoverable damages (e.g., excluding special, incidental, or consequential damages), it does not define a statute of limitations or a deadline for filing claims. \n\n**Answer:** Yes, the contract includes a cap on liability, limiting recovery to the amounts actually paid by the other party.

      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, there appears to be a restriction on SONY's ability to compete with PURCHASER (GSI Technology, Inc.). Specifically:\n\nSection 3.2 states that the license grant back to SONY from PURCHASER is \"Subject to SONY's compliance with the covenant not to compete in Section 8.3 of Asset Purchase Agreement.\" This indicates that there is a non-compete obligation on SONY contained in the Asset Purchase Agreement.\n\nWithout seeing the full Asset Purchase Agreement, the exact scope of the non-compete is not clear. But this provision suggests that SONY has agreed to some limitations on its ability to compete with the business and products that were acquired by PURCHASER.\n\nSo in summary, yes there is a restriction on SONY's ability to compete with PURCHASER, though the specific terms of that restriction are not fully detailed in the Intellectual Property Agreement itself.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if there's a restriction on a party's ability to compete with the counterparty or operate in a certain geography or business sector based on the provided context.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the context thoroughly. The context is a legal document, specifically an IP Agreement and related sections from an Asset Purchase Agreement. The sections mentioned are 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 8.5, 8.6, 8.7, 8.8, and 9.3. \n\nLooking at Section 3.2, it's about liability. It states that neither party is liable for injuries, losses, or damages arising from their products or promotional activities. This doesn't mention competition restrictions. \n\nSection 3.3 and 3.4 deal with licenses and sublicenses. They specify that no implied licenses are granted and no sublicensing rights exist. Again, no mention of competition restrictions here.\n\nMoving to Section 8.5, it's about the sufficiency of intellectual property. SONY claims they own or have rights to all necessary IP for their business. This is about ownership, not competition.\n\nSection 8.6 addresses non-infringement. It states there's no notice of infringement claims against SONY's business. Still, nothing about competition.\n\nSection 8.7 talks about third-party infringement. SONY claims no third parties are infringing their IP. Again, not related to competition restrictions.\n\nSection 8.8 covers intellectual property development, ensuring that employees and consultants have signed confidentiality and assignment agreements. This is about protecting IP, not restricting competition.\n\nSection 9.3 is about successors and assigns. It allows assignment with consent, except in cases of mergers or asset sales. No competition restrictions here.\n\nThe key point is that none of the sections mention non-compete clauses, geographic restrictions, or limitations on business sectors. The document focuses on IP ownership, liability disclaimers, and licensing terms. There's no language that would prevent a party from competing or operating in specific areas. Therefore, the answer should be that there are no such restrictions based on the provided context.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: No, the provided context does not indicate any restrictions on a party's ability to compete with the counterparty or operate in a specific geography, business, or technology sector. The document focuses on intellectual property (IP) ownership,",

      "question": "Is a party\u2019s liability uncapped upon the breach of its obligation in the contract? This also includes uncap liability for a particular type of breach such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality obligation.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the provisions in the Intellectual Property Agreement, a party's liability does not appear to be uncapped upon a breach of its obligations.\n\nThe key relevant sections are:\n\n1. Section 4.2 on Indemnification - This section states that the parties will indemnify each other for liabilities relating to their respective IP assets and liabilities. However, there is no indication that the indemnification is uncapped or unlimited.\n\n2. Section 4.3 - This section incorporates the indemnification terms from the Separation Agreement, which also do not indicate that the indemnification is uncapped.\n\n3. There are no other provisions in the Intellectual Property Agreement that suggest the parties have uncapped or unlimited liability for breaches of the agreement, including for IP infringement or breach of confidentiality obligations.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the contract, the parties' liability does not appear to be uncapped upon a breach of their obligations. The indemnification and liability provisions seem to be limited in scope and subject to the other terms and conditions of the agreement.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether a party's liability is uncapped in case of breaching their obligations under the contract, specifically mentioning IP infringement or confidentiality breaches.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context to find any mentions of liability caps or uncapped liabilities. The context is a legal agreement, so terms like \"indemnify,\" \"hold harmless,\" and \"Liabilities\" are key here.\n\nLooking at the sections provided, there's a lot about indemnification. For example, in the last part, it says SpinCo must indemnify Parent Indemnitees for SpinCo IP Liabilities, and Parent must indemnify SpinCo Indemnitees for Parent IP Liabilities. The language uses \"any and all Liabilities\" without specifying a cap. That suggests that the liability isn't capped in those cases.\n\nAlso, in Section 2.4(b), SpinCo is required to pay and discharge obligations related to Unreleased SpinCo IP Liabilities \"fully,\" which implies no cap. Similarly, in the Allocation of Costs and Recoveries (Section 3.6(c)), there's a mention of reimbursing costs and expenses, but again, no cap is mentioned.\n\nThe context also mentions that nothing in certain sections releases any person from liabilities, especially regarding indemnification. The indemnification clauses don't specify a maximum amount, so by default, the liability would be uncapped unless stated otherwise. Since the question is about whether the liability is uncapped, and the context doesn't mention any caps, the answer would be yes.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's any part of the context that might limit liability. The first part says that upon termination, no liability exists, but that's about termination, not breaches. The indemnification sections don't mention exclusions or caps, so it's safe to assume that the liability is indeed uncapped for breaches like IP infringement or confidentiality.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: Yes, under the terms of the agreement, a party\u2019s liability is **uncapped** for breaches of obligations, including specific breaches such as IP infringement or confidentiality violations. The indemnification provisions (e.g., in Sections 2.4(b) and the final paragraphs) require parties to fully indemnify and hold harmless the other party for all liabilities arising from such breaches, without specifying any caps or limitations. Additionally, the agreement explicitly states that nothing in the termination clauses (Section 4.1)",

The total annual franchise fee paid by the Grantee (Roanoke Gas Company) to the three localities (Grantor, Roanoke, and Salem) is set at $98,196 for the base year 2016.\n\n2.

The franchise fee is calculated solely based on the pro-rata percentage of total gas sales, without any apparent caps or thresholds.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if there's a fee increase or consent requirement when one party's use of the product or services exceeds a certain threshold. The context provided is about a franchise agreement between the Town of Vinton and Roanoke Gas Company.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the context for any mention of thresholds or conditions that trigger changes in fees or require consent. The main sections here are about the franchise fee calculation. \n\nIn part (a), the franchise fee is based on a pro rata share of gas sales in each locality. The base year is 2016 with a total of $98,196. The fee is calculated by each locality's percentage of total gas sales. So if sales in one locality increase relative to others, their share of the fee would change. But there's no mention of a threshold that would trigger a fee increase beyond that calculation.\n\nLooking at part (b), the total annual franchise fee for all localities increases by 3% each year, compounded annually. This is a standard annual increase, not dependent on usage thresholds. The percentage share each locality gets is still based on their sales proportion each year. There's no mention of a specific threshold that would require consent or a different fee structure if exceeded.\n\nThe context also mentions maintaining a business office in the locality and notice requirements, but nothing about usage thresholds triggering additional fees or needing consent. The fee adjustments are based on the formula provided and the annual 3% increase. \n\nSo, the answer would be that there's no specific threshold mentioned that triggers a fee increase or consent requirement. The fees adjust annually by 3% and are based on the pro rata share of gas sales each year. Unless there's a change in the agreement terms beyond what's provided, exceeding usage thresholds doesn't seem to require additional consent or fee changes beyond the stated formulas.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: The context does not specify a fee increase or consent requirement tied to exceeding a usage threshold. Instead, the franchise fee is calculated annually based on a pro rata share of gas sales within each locality (e.g., Town of Vinton) relative to total sales across all three localities (Roanoke, Salem, and Vinton). Additionally, the total annual franchise fee for all localities increases by 3% compounded annually, regardless of usage thresholds. The percentage share each locality receives is recalculated yearly based on sales distribution, but there is",

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the contract contains a license grant to a licensee, including any sublicensors and their affiliates.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the context provided. The context is a contract between MediaNet Group Technologies and a Reseller. The key sections mentioned are the LICENSE section (1) and some other parts like 10.2 and the RESELLER PORTAL section.\n\nIn section 1, it says the Reseller is licensed to market the Brand-A-Port portals and resell products/services. The term \"licensed\" here refers to the Reseller being granted rights by MediaNet. The question is about whether the license is granted to the licensee (which would be the Reseller here) and their affiliates or sublicensors.\n\nLooking at the exact wording: \"Reseller is hereunder licensed to market...\" So the license is directly to the Reseller. The question is if it includes sublicensors and affiliates. The context doesn't mention anything about sublicensing. There's a part that says the Reseller can't assign or transfer the agreement without consent, except to a successor. That might imply that sublicensing isn't allowed unless specifically permitted. \n\nAlso, in the RESELLER PORTAL part, it mentions MediaNet producing a Branded Portal for the Licensee under a Portal Agreement. But again, no mention of sublicensors or affiliates. The term \"Licensee\" here is the Reseller. The question is whether the license extends to affiliates or sublicensors of the Reseller. Since the contract doesn't explicitly state that the Reseller can sublicense or that affiliates are included, the answer would be no. The license is specifically to the Reseller, not their affiliates or anyone else unless they have a separate agreement. \n\nSo the answer should be that the contract grants a license to the Reseller (the licensee) but not to their affiliates or sublicensors unless specified elsewhere, which it isn't here. Therefore, the answer is no.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: The contract grants a license to the Reseller (referred to as the \"Licensee\" in the context) to market and resell MediaNet Group Technologies' products and services. However, the license does **not explicitly extend to affiliates or sublicensors** of the Reseller. The agreement prohibits the Reseller from assigning or transferring the contract without prior written consent, except to a successor, which implies sublicensing or indirect licensing to affiliates/sublicensors",

      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the consulting agreement provided, there are several provisions that indicate the parties do have certain obligations that survive the termination or expiration of the agreement:\n\n1. Section 8.2 states that the obligations of Sections 3, 5, 6 and 7 shall survive any termination of the agreement. These sections cover key provisions such as:\n   - Independent contractor relationship (Section 3)\n   - Confidentiality and non-disclosure of proprietary information (Section 5) \n   - Ownership of intellectual property and work product (Section 6)\n   - Restrictive covenants like non-solicitation and non-competition (Section 7)\n\n2. Section 8.1 requires the consultant to promptly return all materials, property, documents, data, and other information belonging to the company upon termination.\n\n3. Section 9.7 on indemnification provides obligations that survive termination for a period of 3 years.\n\n4. The Statement of Work indicates the initial 12-month term will automatically renew for an additional 12 months unless the agreement is terminated, suggesting ongoing obligations during any renewal period.\n\nSo in summary, yes, the agreement demonstrates that the parties have certain post-termination obligations, particularly around confidentiality, intellectual property, restrictive covenants, and indemnification. The agreement is structured to have key provisions survive beyond the termination or expiration of the overall consulting relationship.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if a party is subject to obligations after the termination or expiration of a contract, including things like post-termination transitions, payments, IP transfers, etc.\n\nLooking at the provided context, there's a section called \"8.2 Obligations Surviving Termination\" which states that the obligations of Sections 3, 5, 6, and 7 survive any termination. So those specific sections must outline what those obligations are. Then there's a part (d) that says a particular section survives for three years after termination. \n\nThe termination clauses mention different scenarios like death, bankruptcy, termination for cause, or 90 days notice. Also, there's a provision about a Change of Control and a termination fee if the consultant is let go without cause within a year of that event.\n\nThe question is about whether obligations exist post-termination. The answer should reference the surviving obligations mentioned in 8.2. The example given in the context includes things like termination for cause and the Change of Control scenario. The surviving obligations might include things like confidentiality (Section 5?), non-compete (Section 6?), and maybe payment terms (Section 3 or 7?).\n\nThe user's answer should confirm that yes, certain obligations survive termination, citing the specific sections and the three-year survival period mentioned in part (d). Also, the Change of Control provision would be an example of a post-termination payment obligation. So the answer should list the surviving sections and mention the three-year period, along with examples like the termination fee under Change of Control.\n</think>\n\nYes, a party is subject to obligations after the termination or expiration of the contract. The context explicitly states in **Section 8.2 (Obligations Surviving Termination)** that the obligations of **Sections 3, 5, 6, and 7** survive any termination of the Agreement. Additionally, **Section (d)** specifies that certain obligations (e.g., confidentiality, non-compete, or other post-termination covenants) survive for **three (3) years** after termination.  \n\nExamples of post-termination obligations include:  \n1. **Termination for Cause**: If terminated for cause (e.g., fraud, breach of contract), obligations under surviving sections (e.g., confidentiality, IP ownership) remain in effect.  \n2. **Change of Control**: If the Company terminates the Agreement",

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if there's a non-contracting party who is a beneficiary to some or all of the clauses in the contract and can enforce rights against a contracting party.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context. The context includes several sections of a contract. Let me go through each part carefully.\n\nStarting with section (c), it talks about waivers needing to be in writing and not constituting a continuing waiver. Then (d) is about assignment requiring written consent. (e) states that the parties are independent contractors, not agents or partners, and can't act on behalf of each other without consent. \n\nThen there's another (c) section (maybe a typo?) that lists termination conditions if a party goes bankrupt, is insolvent, etc. Then (f) covers force majeure, where delays due to uncontrollable circumstances aren't breaches. The Survival clause says certain provisions remain enforceable after termination. The Non-Solicitation of Employees clause prohibits hiring each other's employees for a year after the agreement ends.\n\nThe question is about a non-contracting party being a beneficiary. A non-contracting party would be someone not a signatory to the agreement. The contract's clauses are between the two parties. The answer depends on whether any clauses extend benefits to third parties.\n\nLooking at the clauses: \n\n- The assignment clause (d) requires consent for third-party assignments, but that's about transferring rights, not creating beneficiaries.\n- The independent contractor clause (e) prevents parties from acting as agents, which might affect third parties but doesn't make them beneficiaries.\n- The termination clauses (c) are between the two parties.\n- Force majeure (f) is between the two parties.\n- Survival and Non-Solicitation are also between the two parties.\n\nThe Non-Solicitation clause mentions affiliates. If an affiliate is considered a third party, maybe they have some rights. But the clause says \"both parties agree not to hire or allow its respective affiliates to hire...\" So the affiliates are part of the agreement in that they are bound by the non-solicitation, but are they beneficiaries? The affiliates are part of the parties' own companies, so they might be considered part of the contracting parties' organizations rather than third parties. The clause is preventing the parties from hiring each other's employees, including through their affiliates. So the affiliates are subject to the restriction but not necessarily beneficiaries",

Typically, contracts are named based on the parties involved. Here, the main parties might be Athene Life Re Ltd. and AISG GP Ltd. Since the document is an agreement between them, the name could be something like \"Agreement between Athene Life Re Ltd. and AISG GP Ltd.\" or similar. However, the exact name might be specified in the title. But in the given context, the only title-like line is \"O'Mara Authorized Signatory\" followed by the company names.

Since there's no explicit title given, perhaps the answer is derived from the parties involved. The user might expect the answer to be \"Athene Life Re Ltd. Agreement\" or similar. Alternatively, since the signatories are O'Mara and Apollo Principal Holdings, maybe the contract is between Athene Life Re Ltd. and Apollo Principal Holdings III GP, Ltd. through AISG GP Ltd.

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of the contract based on the provided context. Let me look through the document to find any mention of the contract's name.\n\nFirst, I notice that the context includes several clauses, like 7.5, 7.6, and definitions in 1.1. The parties involved are OICL (Otkritie Investments Cyprus Limited, probably) and QIWI. There's a mention of a \"Deed of Subscription\" in the definition of \"Completion 1\". Also, the document is referred to as \"this Agreement\" multiple times. \n\nLooking at the beginning, the relevant details list \"OICL\" and \"QIWI\" as the parties. The title of the document isn't explicitly stated, but sometimes contracts are named based on the parties involved or the type of agreement. Since there's a Deed of Subscription mentioned, maybe the main contract is a subscription agreement. However, the user is asking for the name of the contract presented here. \n\nThe document starts with \"EXECUTED and DELIVERED as a DEED...\" for both QIWI PLC and Otkritie Investments Cyprus Limited. The term \"Deed\" is used, which is a formal document. The title might be something like \"Deed of Subscription\" since that's referenced in the definitions. Alternatively, it could be a \"Share Subscription Agreement\" or similar. \n\nBut the exact name isn't given in the context provided. However, in the definition section under 1.1, \"Completion 1\" refers to the Deed of Subscription. The main document here is the agreement between OICL and QIWI, which includes various clauses. Since the user is asking for the name of the contract, and the only specific name mentioned is \"Deed of Subscription\" in the definition, but that's part of another document. The main agreement here is between OICL and QIWI, so perhaps the name is derived from the parties. \n\nAlternatively, the title might be something like \"Share Subscription and Confidentiality Agreement\" or similar, but without an explicit title, it's tricky. However, since the document is executed as a deed and includes subscription-related terms, the most likely answer is that the contract is called the \"Deed of Subscription\" between the two parties.

Also, they have a remaining shelf life of at least twelve months. Then, there's a part about the Customer's exclusive remedy being replacement of any product that doesn't meet these standards.\n\nWait, the question is about the duration of the warranty.

The context says the Company makes no other warranties except those expressed in paragraph 2.6. The only warranties mentioned are merchantability, salable quality, and shelf life. There's no mention of a specific duration beyond the shelf life. The shelf life is 12 months, but that's about the product's usability, not necessarily the warranty period for defects.

But the duration isn't explicitly stated. The 12-month shelf life is part of the warranty condition. So if a product is found to be not merchantable after shipment, the replacement is available. But how long does that warranty last? The context doesn't specify a time period beyond the shelf life. It just states that at the time of shipment, the products meet the standards. So maybe the warranty is only for the period until the shelf life is up? Or is it that the warranty is only for the time when the product is still within the 12-month shelf life?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the warranty period is not explicitly stated in terms of duration beyond the shelf life.

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the contract contains a license grant by affiliates of the licensor or includes intellectual property from those affiliates. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context to find any mentions of licensing or intellectual property. The context is a legal agreement between two parties, likely Playa and Hyatt, regarding development opportunities for a Hyatt All-Inclusive Resort.\n\nLooking at the sections mentioned, there's a part about the First Offer for Development Opportunities. When a Development Opportunity arises, the Receiving Party (either Playa or Hyatt) can exercise a right of first offer. If Playa is the Receiving Party, they would negotiate a management agreement with Hyatt's affiliate, subject to a franchise agreement. If Hyatt is the Receiving Party, they would negotiate a franchise agreement with Playa's affiliate. \n\nFranchise agreements typically involve licensing intellectual property, like brand names and trademarks. The mention of a franchise agreement between Hyatt and their affiliate suggests that Hyatt is licensing their brand (which is intellectual property) to their affiliate. Similarly, if Playa's affiliate is involved in managing the resort under Hyatt's brand, that would also involve licensing Hyatt's IP.\n\nAdditionally, there's a section where if a third party approaches either party, they must introduce the other party to the third party. For example, if a third party wants to operate a Hyatt resort and hasn't chosen a management company, Hyatt must notify Playa. This implies that Playa might get the chance to manage using Hyatt's brand, which again would require a license of Hyatt's intellectual property.\n\nThe key points here are the franchise agreements and the management agreements. Franchise agreements inherently involve licensing intellectual property, such as trademarks, trade names, and operational systems. Since the contract mentions these agreements between affiliates and third parties, it's likely that the license grants include intellectual property from the licensor's affiliates.\n\nI should also check if there's any explicit mention of intellectual property. The context doesn't directly use the term \"intellectual property,\" but franchise agreements typically cover that. The fact that Hyatt's affiliate would own the property and then there's a management agreement under a franchise agreement suggests that the brand (IP) is being licensed. \n\nTherefore, the answer is yes, the contract does contain license grants involving intellectual property of affiliates. The franchise and management agreements imply that Hyatt's affiliates are licensing their",

The context is a legal agreement between MKOS and UTEK. Let me go through each section.\n\nThe first part talks about remedies for breach of contract, mentioning injunctive relief and not needing to prove damages. Then there's a part about MKOS acknowledging that UTEK's technology sources are third-party institutions, and UTEK doesn't control if they show the tech to others. \n\nNext, there's a section about assignment of rights, stating that UTEK can't assign their rights without MKOS's consent, except to subsidiaries. Then there's a part about arbitration and litigation, where the prevailing party can recover attorneys' fees. Lastly, expenses are each party's own responsibility.\n\nNow, the question is about contesting IP ownership validity or unrelated claims. The context doesn't mention anything about IP ownership validity. There's a part where MKOS acknowledges that UTEK doesn't control the third-party licensors showing tech to others, but that's about disclosure, not ownership validity. Also, there's no clause that restricts either party from bringing claims unrelated to the contract. The agreement seems to cover breach of contract remedies, assignment, and legal fees, but not limitations on other legal actions. \n\nSo, unless there's a specific clause in the context that restricts such actions, the answer would be no.

      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the information provided in the contract, there does not appear to be an exclusive dealing commitment with the counterparty. The agreement is for SEV to provide maintenance services for Dairy Crest's vehicle fleet, but there is no indication that Dairy Crest is required to procure all of its maintenance services exclusively from SEV. The agreement also does not include any prohibitions on Dairy Crest working with other parties for maintenance services or other services. Overall, the agreement appears to be a standard service contract without any exclusive dealing commitments.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if there's an exclusive dealing commitment in the provided contract context. They want to know if one party is committed to buying all their needs from the other, or if there's a ban on dealing with third parties, either during or after the contract.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the context given. Let me scan through the clauses mentioned. The context includes several sections: third party rights, excepted services, assignment and sub-contractors, and definitions like EGV. \n\nLooking at the assignment and sub-contractors section (Clause 26), there's mention of SEV needing DCL's consent to assign the agreement or sub-contract. Specifically, Clause 26.2 says SEV can sub-contract with DCL's consent, which can't be unreasonably withheld. Then, Clause 26.3 states that SEV can't engage agents or sub-contractors for Maintenance Services without DCL's consent. Also, Clause 26.4 holds SEV responsible for sub-contractors' actions as if they were their own.\n\nBut does this imply an exclusive dealing commitment? The key here is whether the contract requires SEV to use only one sub-contractor or prohibits them from working with others. The clauses mention needing consent, but not exclusivity. Consent can be given, but there's no statement that SEV must use only one sub-contractor or that they can't work with others. The requirement is about getting consent, not about exclusivity. \n\nAlso, looking at other clauses like 30.2, which says parties don't rely on any statements outside the agreement, and 31 about excepted services, there's no mention of exclusive procurement or prohibitions on third-party dealings. The third party rights clause (the first one) also doesn't indicate exclusivity; it just says non-parties can't enforce terms unless under the 1999 Act.\n\nSo, based on the provided context, there's no explicit clause that requires one party to procure all services from the other or prohibits dealing with third parties. The sub-contracting clauses require consent but don't enforce exclusivity. Therefore, there's no exclusive dealing commitment mentioned here.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: No, there is no exclusive dealing commitment with the counterparty in the provided context. The clauses related to sub-contracting (e.g., Clause 2",

(the Principal) and PreCheck Health Services, Inc. (the Distributor), but does not mention any provisions related to rights of first refusal, first offer, or first negotiation. The agreement appears to focus on the terms of the distribution arrangement, such as the appointment of PreCheck as a non-exclusive distributor, the territory, pricing, and termination clauses, without any references to the types of rights mentioned in the question.",

The user is asking if there's a clause in the provided context that grants a right of first refusal, right of first offer, or right of first negotiation regarding purchasing, licensing, marketing, or distributing equity, technology, assets, products, or services.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the context given. The context is an excerpt from a legal agreement between PreCheck Health Services, Inc. (Distributor) and Co-Diagnostics, Inc. (Principal). The key sections mentioned are about additions to products, mutual agreement, rejection of new products, the Principal's right to market if the Distributor rejects, passing on sales leads, and representations about rights and assignments.\n\nLooking at the first paragraph: If the Distributor rejects a new product, the Principal can market and distribute it. That seems like a right the Principal has if the Distributor doesn't want it. But is that a right of first refusal? A right of first refusal usually means the existing party has the first chance to buy or do something before others. Here, it's more about the Principal retaining the right to handle the product if the Distributor rejects it. It's not exactly a right of first refusal because there's no mention of the Distributor having the first chance to accept or reject before others. Instead, it's a fallback if the Distributor says no.\n\nNext, the Principal can contact customers but must pass sales leads to the Distributor. That's about exclusivity in handling sales leads, not about rights to purchase or license equity or assets.\n\nThe other parts talk about representations that they have the right to enter the agreement and that the Principal owns the IP. No mention of rights of first refusal in those sections.\n\nThe question is about any clause granting a right of first refusal, etc., for various interests. The context doesn't mention anything about purchasing equity, technology, assets, etc. The only specific right mentioned is the Principal's right to market a rejected product. That's a specific right related to product distribution, not a broader right of first refusal on equity or assets.\n\nSo, based on the provided context, there's no clause that grants a right of first refusal, first offer, or first negotiation for purchasing equity, technology, assets, etc. The only right mentioned is the Principal's ability to handle a rejected product, which is a different scenario.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: No, the provided context does not include a clause granting a right of",

Let me look through the context provided.\n\nFirst, the context mentions that if Maimon can't serve as CEO due to reasons like death or disability, the company can terminate with five days' notice. But that's with cause, right? Because it's based on Maimon's inability to perform. Then there's a part where Maimon can resign at any time with 30 days' notice. That's Maimon's right to terminate without cause, I think. \n\nThen the company has the option to terminate the agreement after the Minimum Period (which is 12 months) with five days' notice. The key here is \"at its discretion and at its option terminate this Agreement at any time after the Minimum Period upon five days prior written notice to Maimon.\" So after the initial 12 months, the company can terminate without cause by giving five days' notice. \n\nSo the answer would be yes, but only under certain conditions. The company can do it after the Minimum Period, and Maimon can resign anytime with 30 days' notice. The user is asking if either party can terminate without cause. The company can after the Minimum Period, and Maimon can at any time. So the answer should confirm that both parties have that right under specific terms. The company's right is limited to after the 12-month period, while Maimon's is anytime.

The user is asking whether the contract includes a license grant by affiliates of the licensor or that includes intellectual property of affiliates. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context. The main clauses mentioned are 10.2 and 10.1, and there's a definitions section. \n\nStarting with the definitions, \"Affiliates\" are defined as subsidiaries or other entities mutually agreed in writing. So, the term is present in the contract. \n\nLooking at clause 10.2: Each Party grants the other a non-exclusive license to use the other's Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) strictly necessary for marketing and promotional obligations. The key here is that the license is between the two Parties, not their affiliates. The clause says \"the other Party's IPR,\" which refers directly to the other Party, not their affiliates. \n\nAlso, in the definitions, \"Group\" is defined as a company and its Holding Company, Subsidiaries, etc. But the license in 10.2 doesn't mention the Group or affiliates. It's specifically between the two Parties. \n\nClause 10.1 states that all IPR vested in a Party prior to the agreement remain with that Party. There's no mention of affiliates here either. \n\nThe question is about whether the license is granted by affiliates or includes affiliates' IP. Since the license in 10.2 is between the Parties themselves and not their affiliates, and there's no explicit extension to affiliates' IP, the answer would be no. The license is limited to the Parties' own IPR, not their affiliates. \n\nAdditionally, the definitions of Affiliates exist, but unless there's a clause that specifically includes them in the license, they aren't part of it. The contract doesn't mention that the license applies to affiliates' IPR. \n\nSo, the answer should be that the contract does not contain such a license grant.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: No, the contract does not contain a license grant by affiliates of the licensor or that includes intellectual property of affiliates of the licensor. The license granted in Clause 10.2 is strictly between the two Parties and applies only to the other Party's Intellectual Property Rights (as defined in the Agreement).

      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the terms of the agreement, it does not appear that either party can terminate the contract without cause solely by giving notice and allowing a waiting period to expire.\n\nThe termination provisions are outlined in Section 14.2 of the agreement. This section lists the specific conditions under which either party can terminate the agreement, and they all require some form of material breach, insolvency, or other substantive reason for termination.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- Section 14.2(a) allows either party to terminate immediately upon written notice in the event the other party becomes insolvent, files for bankruptcy, admits inability to pay debts, etc.\n\n- Section 14.2(a) also allows either party to terminate immediately upon written notice if the other party fails to cure a default within 30 days after written notice.\n\n- Section 14.2(b) allows Licensor to terminate with 90 days' prior written notice if Licensee does not meet certain revenue targets (the \"Quota Amount\").\n\n- Section 14.2(b) also allows Licensor to terminate with 30 days' prior written notice if Licensee undergoes a change of control event.\n\nThere is no provision that would allow either party to simply terminate the agreement without cause by giving notice and allowing a waiting period to expire. The termination rights are limited to the specific circumstances outlined in Section 14.2.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if a party can terminate the contract without cause, just by giving notice and waiting a period. I need to check the provided context for any termination clauses that allow this.\n\nLooking at the context, there's Article 14 about Term and Termination. Section 14.1 talks about the term of the agreement. It says the agreement is effective until either termination under Article 14 or two years after the date. Then it mentions automatic renewal for one-year terms unless a party gives 60 days' notice before the end of the original or any renewal term. Also, if the parties don't agree on the Quota Amount for a renewal term 60 days before it starts, the agreement won't renew.\n\nSo, if a party gives 60 days' notice before the end of the term, they can terminate without needing any specific cause. That's termination without cause. The key part here is the notice period. The answer should be yes, because the contract allows termination by giving 60 days' notice without needing a reason, as long as it's done before the end of the term. The other termination clauses in 14.2 are for specific causes like insolvency or failure to meet quotas, but the automatic renewal clause in 14.1 allows termination without cause via the notice period.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: Yes, a party can terminate this contract without cause by providing written notice at least sixty (60) days prior to the end of the original or any renewal term. This is explicitly stated in **Section 14.1 (TERM)**, which allows termination without requiring any specific reason, provided the notice is delivered within the specified timeframe. No additional cause or waiting period beyond the 60-day notice is required for termination without cause.",

      "question": "Is there a minimum order size or minimum amount or units per-time period that one party must buy from the counterparty under the contract?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the provided context, there is no mention of a minimum order size, minimum amount, or units per time period that one party must buy from the other. The amendment appears to focus on defining the territory and the distribution relationship, but does not include any details about minimum purchase requirements. The agreement seems to be a distribution agreement without any clear minimum purchase obligations specified.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if there's a minimum order size or units per time period in the provided contract context.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the context carefully. The context is about an amendment to a distribution agreement between NETGEAR and a Distributor. The main points discussed are about the exclusivity of the distributor for a certain period, the definition of a distributor, and the rights of NETGEAR to sell to other customers after a specific period. \n\nLooking through the text, the key sections talk about the distributor being the only one appointed for a year, the marketing plan, and then after a certain period, the exclusivity ends. There's mention of the distributor acquiring products directly from NETGEAR for resale, but nothing about minimum order quantities. \n\nI should check for any terms like \"minimum order,\" \"minimum units,\" \"purchase commitments,\" or similar phrases. The context doesn't mention any of these. The focus is on exclusivity periods and definitions rather than purchase obligations. \n\nThe amendment also states that it supersedes conflicting terms of the original agreement but doesn't mention anything about minimum orders. Since the original agreement's other terms remain unchanged, unless there was a minimum order in the original agreement, which isn't referenced here, the answer would be that there's no mention of it in the provided context.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, there's no indication of a minimum order size or units required.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: The provided context does not mention any minimum order size, minimum amount, or units per time period that one party must purchase from the counterparty under the contract. The focus of the amendment is on exclusivity periods, definitions of \"distributor,\" and NETGEAR's rights to sell to other customers after specified terms.

I need to look through the provided context to find any mention of the Effective Date.\n\nFirst, the context starts with \"Unless otherwise terminated as provided herein, the initial term of this Agreement shall be three (3) years from the Effective Date...\" So here, the Effective Date is mentioned as the starting point for the initial term.

It says the warranty is limited to one year starting from the date it was shipped to the integrator or another specified date. But this is about the warranty, not the contract's effective date.\n\nAnother part mentions units shipped by WLI to a customer being considered activated on the shipment date, and the monthly license fee starts then. But again, this relates to activation and fees, not the contract's effective date.\n\nThe termination clause says termination doesn't release obligations, but that's about ending the contract, not its start date.\n\nSo, the context refers to the \"Effective Date\" but doesn't provide the actual date.

      "question": "Does intellectual property created\u00a0 by one party become the property of the counterparty, either per the terms of the contract or upon the occurrence of certain events?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "No, the contract does not indicate that intellectual property created by one party becomes the property of the counterparty. The contract explicitly states the following regarding intellectual property:\n\n1. Airspan retains exclusive right, title, and interest in and to any trademarks, trade names, logos and designations that Airspan has adopted, used, or registered (Section 9.1).\n\n2. Airspan retains the validity of its copyright in any written material to which it has made a copyright claim (Section 9.2). \n\n3. The agreement grants Distributor only a license to resell the Airspan Products, and does not transfer any right, title, or interest in any of the Airspan Software to Distributor (Section 1.1).\n\n4. The agreement states that nothing in the agreement is to be construed as granting to or conferring upon Distributor any rights, by license or otherwise, express or implied, in Airspan's Confidential Information, other than the right to use the Confidential Information for the purpose of the agreement (Section 10.6).\n\nThere are no provisions in the contract indicating that intellectual property created by one party becomes the property of the counterparty, either under the terms of the contract or upon the occurrence of certain events. The contract is structured to maintain Airspan's ownership and control over its intellectual property.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether intellectual property created by one party becomes the property of the counterparty either through the contract terms or certain events. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context for any relevant sections. The context includes several sections from a contract between Airspan and the Distributor. Let me scan through the sections mentioned.\n\nLooking at the sections, there's a part about assignments and termination. Section 21.3 talks about assignment and subcontracting needing consent, but that's about transferring obligations, not IP ownership. Then there's section 8.4 which mentions that Airspan's equipment remains their property, and Distributor can't create liens or pledges without consent. Also, section 8.5 states that the Software remains the exclusive property of Airspan. \n\nThen there's the indemnity section 17.1 where Airspan indemnifies against infringement claims. Section 17.3 mentions returning equipment and software if there's an injunction, and Airspan refunds the depreciated value. \n\nThe question is about intellectual property created by one party becoming the other's. The contract mentions that the Software is Airspan's exclusive property (8.5). There's no mention of the Distributor creating IP that becomes Airspan's, or vice versa. The indemnity covers infringement by Airspan's IP, but doesn't transfer ownership. \n\nAlso, in termination sections like 13.5, the Distributor must return Confidential Information but there's no indication that any IP created by either party transfers ownership. The contract doesn't specify that any IP created during the agreement becomes the other party's property. \n\nSo, based on the provided context, the answer would be no. The contract doesn't state that IP created by one party becomes the other's. The Software remains Airspan's, and there's no clause about new IP created by either party transferring ownership unless specified in other sections not mentioned here. The user's question is about whether the contract terms or events lead to IP transfer, but the given sections don't support that.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: No, the intellectual property created by one party does not become the property of the counterparty under the terms of the provided contract. The agreement explicitly states that **Software remains the exclusive property of Airspan** (Section 8.5), and there are no provisions indicating that intellectual property (IP) created by either party during the agreement transfers ownership",
