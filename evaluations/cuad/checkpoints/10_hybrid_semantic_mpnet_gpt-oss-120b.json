      "question": "Is a party\u2019s liability uncapped upon the breach of its obligation in the contract? This also includes uncap liability for a particular type of breach such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality obligation.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the context provided in the Cooperation Agreement, there does not appear to be any uncapped liability for a party's breach of the contract. The agreement does not explicitly state that a party's liability is uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.\n\nThe relevant sections are:\n\n1. Clause 5 on Confidential Information, which states that the obligations of confidentiality shall remain in force until the relevant information enters the public domain otherwise than by the default of a party. This suggests there is no uncapped liability for breach of the confidentiality obligation.\n\n2. Clause 4.1 regarding QIWI's obligation to settle transactions through Otkritie's bank. This clause states that if QIWI terminates this obligation, it shall pay a fee to Otkritie, but this fee is capped at RUB 50,000,000. This indicates a cap on liability for breach of this specific obligation.\n\n3. The agreement does not contain any other provisions that suggest uncapped liability for breach of the contract or specific types of breaches. The dispute resolution clause (Clause 9) also does not indicate uncapped damages.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the Cooperation Agreement, the liability of the parties does not appear to be uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.",
      "generated_response": "**Short answer:**  \nThe excerpt you provided does **not** contain any clause that limits or caps a party\u2019s liability for breaches \u2013 whether for a general breach, an IP\u2011infringement claim, or a breach of the confidentiality obligations in clause\u202f5.1. Consequently, unless a limitation\u2011of\u2011liability provision appears elsewhere in the agreement, the parties\u2019 liability would be *uncapped* (i.e., they could be liable for the full amount of damages that a court or arbitrator determines they owe).\n\n**Why the text leads to that conclusion**\n\n| Clause / Section | What it says | Relevance to liability |\n|-------------------|--------------|------------------------|\n| **5.1\u20115.4 (Confidentiality)** | Sets out duties to keep information confidential and the consequences of unlawful disclosure, but it does **not** specify any monetary cap or limitation on damages for a breach. | No cap on liability for confidentiality breaches. |\n| **7.5\u20117.6 (Assignment / Third\u2011party rights)** | Deals with assignment and third\u2011party enforcement; again, no limitation\u2011of\u2011liability language",

The provisions of Sections 3.6, 4, 6, 8, 9 and 11 shall survive any termination of the agreement (Section 10.8).\n\n2.

The contract states that \"any controversy between the parties arising under this Agreement and not resolved by the parties shall be determined in accordance with the laws of the State of Michigan\", but does not specify any statute of limitations or damage caps.\n\nSo in summary, the contract includes a limitation of liability provision that restricts the recourse of the Shipper to only the assets of the Transporter, but does not appear to include any time limitations or maximum recovery amounts.",

No indemnifying party shall:\n\n(i) without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), settle or compromise or  consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which  indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim  or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising  out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding, or\n\n(ii) be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld),  but if settled with its written consent or if there be a final judgment of the plaintiff in any such action, the indemnifying party agrees to  indemnify and hold harmless any indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.

      "ground_truth_answer": "No, the party's liability is not uncapped upon breach of the contract. The agreement contains specific limitations on liability:\n\n1. Section 10.4(a) limits the aggregate liability of each party in any 12-month period to 1.5 times the aggregate amounts paid or payable by Customer to Manufacturer during the preceding 12-month period, solely with respect to the affected products for which the liability arose.\n\n2. Section 10.4(b) specifically provides that neither party shall be liable for consequential, special, incidental or indirect damages, lost revenue or profits, etc., except in certain enumerated cases, such as a breach of the confidentiality obligations under Section 13.\n\nSo the agreement does not provide for uncapped liability upon breach. The liability is limited in the ways specified in Section 10.4.\n\nThe only exceptions are for certain types of breaches, such as:\n\n- Breaches of the confidentiality obligations under Section 13\n- Gross negligence, fraud or willful misconduct of a party\n- Willful breach of the agreement\n- Indemnification obligations under Sections 10.1 and 10.2 for third-party claims\n\nIn these cases, the limitations on liability in Section 10.4 do not apply.

      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, the contract includes provisions that limit liability upon breach of a party's obligations:\n\n1. Limitation of Liability: Section 12.2 states that \"IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING ANY LOST PROFITS, LOST REVENUES OR LOST SAVINGS, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT AND/OR THE PRODUCTS, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF THE PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED, KNOWS OR SHOULD KNOW, OR IS OTHERWISE AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\" This caps the liability to direct damages only.\n\n2. Time Limitation to Bring Claims: The contract does not explicitly state a time limitation for bringing claims. However, Section 14.3 states that if a party defaults or breaches the agreement, the non-defaulting party must give written notice and the defaulting party has 15 days to cure the breach before the agreement can be terminated. This suggests the parties have at least 15 days to bring a claim for breach before the agreement can be terminated.\n\n3. Maximum Recovery Amount: The contract does not specify a maximum recovery amount for damages. It only limits the types of damages that can be recovered (i.e. no indirect, special, incidental, etc. damages).\n\nIn summary, the contract includes a limitation on liability for certain types of damages, but does not explicitly state a time limitation for bringing claims or a maximum recovery amount.",

      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the information provided in the contract, there does not appear to be a clear and explicit license grant to a licensee (including a sublicensor) and the affiliates of such licensee/sublicensor.\n\nThe contract discusses the responsibilities and obligations of the two parties involved - YourNetPlus.com (the \"Provider\") and Kingdom Connect, Inc. (the \"KCI\"). It does not contain language that grants a license to KCI or its affiliates to use the Provider's services or intellectual property.\n\nThe closest relevant clause is Section 8 \"ASSIGNMENT\", which states that the agreement can be assigned without prior consent to \"any person, partnership, firm or corporation affiliated by common ownership with the assigning party.\" However, this is in the context of allowing the parties to assign the agreement itself, not granting a license.\n\nOverall, the contract does not appear to contain an express license grant to KCI or its affiliates.

The only reference to a \u201cLicensee\u201d appears in the assignment provision (\u201cLicensee\u2019s Subscriber accounts\u201d), which merely restricts the ability to assign or transfer rights; it does not constitute a license grant.

      "ground_truth_answer": "No, the contract does not contain a license grant that is irrevocable or perpetual. The key evidence for this is:\n\n1. Section Ten of the agreement states that \"from and after the termination of the Contract Period, all of the rights of Company to the use of the name of the NFLA shall cease absolutely and Company subsequently shall not use or refer to the NFLA in advertising or promotion in any manner whatsoever.\"\n\n2. The contract defines the \"Contract Period\" to be a term of 3 years, from November 1, 2017 to November 2, 2020, unless terminated sooner or extended.\n\n3. There is no provision in the contract that indicates the license grant would continue beyond the Contract Period or be irrevocable. The agreement states the rights are granted to the company \"during the Contract Period\" only.\n\nTherefore, the license grant is limited to the 3-year Contract Period and is not irrevocable or perpetual based on the terms of the agreement.",
      "generated_response": "No. The agreement only grants the Company a license for the defined **Contract Period** (a three\u2011year term that can be terminated early or extended only as provided in the agreement).

The document primarily outlines the agreement among the various parties to jointly file a Statement on Schedule 13D and any amendments thereto.

      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, there appears to be a restriction on SONY's ability to compete with PURCHASER (GSI Technology, Inc.). Specifically:\n\nSection 3.2 states that the license grant back to SONY from PURCHASER is \"Subject to SONY's compliance with the covenant not to compete in Section 8.3 of Asset Purchase Agreement.\" This indicates that there is a non-compete obligation on SONY contained in the Asset Purchase Agreement.\n\nWithout seeing the full Asset Purchase Agreement, the exact scope of the non-compete is not clear. But this provision suggests that SONY has agreed to some limitations on its ability to compete with the business and products that were acquired by PURCHASER.\n\nSo in summary, yes there is a restriction on SONY's ability to compete with PURCHASER, though the specific terms of that restriction are not fully detailed in the Intellectual Property Agreement itself.",

These sections cover key provisions such as:\n   - Independent contractor relationship (Section 3)\n   - Confidentiality and non-disclosure of proprietary information (Section 5) \n   - Ownership of intellectual property and work product (Section 6)\n   - Restrictive covenants like non-solicitation and non-competition (Section 7)\n\n2. Section 8.1 requires the consultant to promptly return all materials, property, documents, data, and other information belonging to the company upon termination.\n\n3. Section 9.7 on indemnification provides obligations that survive termination for a period of 3 years.\n\n4. The Statement of Work indicates the initial 12-month term will automatically renew for an additional 12 months unless the agreement is terminated, suggesting ongoing obligations during any renewal period.\n\nSo in summary, yes, the agreement demonstrates that the parties have certain post-termination obligations, particularly around confidentiality, intellectual property, restrictive covenants, and indemnification.

      "question": "Does the contract include a cap on liability upon the breach of a party\u2019s obligation? This includes time limitation for the counterparty to bring claims or maximum amount for recovery.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the context provided in the Intellectual Property Agreement, there does not appear to be a specific cap on liability or time limitation for bringing claims in the event of a party's breach of their obligations. \n\nThe agreement does not contain any explicit provisions regarding a cap on liability or statute of limitations for bringing claims. The agreement emphasizes that \"each and every term and condition contained in this Agreement is material, and that each and every term and condition may be reasonably accomplished within the time limitations, and in the manner set forth in this Agreement.\" However, it does not specify any time limitations or caps on liability.\n\nThe only potentially relevant provision is Section 2(c)3, which states that if THI does not pay the required IP costs by the due date, \"the Application or Patent shall revert to Marv as if THI had denied payment.\" This suggests a potential consequence for non-payment, but does not impose a broader cap on liability.\n\nOverall, the agreement does not appear to include any explicit provisions limiting the liability of the parties or the timeframe for bringing claims in the event of a breach. The lack of such provisions indicates there is no cap on liability or statute of limitations specified in the contract.",

The clauses shown address:\n\n* The reduction of an unlawful charge to the legal maximum  \n* That all terms are \u201cmaterial\u201d and that \u201ctime is of the essence\u201d for performance  \n* A fairly detailed confidentiality definition and obligations  \n* The reversion of an exclusive license if a payment is missed  \n* Quarterly reporting requirements  \n\nNone of these sections mention a limitation\u2011of\u2011liability clause, a maximum recoverable amount, or a prescribed period within which a claim must be filed. Therefore, with respect to the material you shared, the contract does **not** include a cap on liability or a time limitation for bringing breach\u2011related claims.
