      "question": "what is the value of rent expense and certain office equipment expense under lease agreements , between 2013 and 2015 ? in million $ .",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Between 2013 and 2015, the value of rent expense and certain office equipment expense under lease agreements amounted to $ 137 million in 2013, $ 132 million in 2014, and $ 136 million in 2015.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking for the value of rent expense and certain office equipment expense under lease agreements between 2013 and 2015. The context provided has some information about the company's lease commitments and expenses.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the context to find the relevant numbers. The second paragraph mentions that \"rent expense and certain office equipment expense under lease agreements amounted to $136 million, $132 million and $137 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\" \n\nWait, the order here is important. Let me parse that again. The numbers are listed as 2015, 2014, 2013. The values are $136 million for 2015, $132 million for 2014, and $137 million for 2013. The question is asking for the total between 2013 and 2015. So that would be adding up the three years: 2013 ($137M) + 2014 ($132M) + 2015 ($136M). \n\nLet me check if there's any other information that might be relevant. The rest of the context talks about lease commitments (future minimum commitments) and some debt issuances, but those don't seem related to the actual expenses incurred between 2013 and 2015. The key numbers are the ones in the second paragraph. \n\nSo adding them up: 137 + 132 + 136. Let me do the math. 137 + 132 is 269, and then adding 136 gives 269 + 136 = 405. So the total rent expense and office equipment expense from 2013 to 2015 is $405 million. \n\nI need to make sure I didn't mix up the years. The paragraph says \"in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\" Wait, the order is 2015, 2014, 2013. The amounts are $136",

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking about the portion of future minimum lease payments due in the next 12 months. The context provided has a table with fiscal years and the corresponding payments.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which years fall into the \"next 12 months\" from the reporting date. The context mentions the data is as of May 31, 2013. So the next 12 months would be from June 1, 2013, to May 31, 2014. Looking at the fiscal years listed, the first year after May 31, 2013, is 2014. The payment for 2014 is $11,057. \n\nWait, but the question is about the next 12 months from when? Since the data is as of May 31, 2013, the next 12 months would be up to May 31, 2014. The 2014 fiscal year ends on May 31, so the entire 2014 payment is due within the next 12 months. The other years (2015 onwards) are beyond that period. \n\nSo the answer should be the 2014 amount, which is $11,057. Let me check the total future payments to confirm. The total is $57,096, which adds up all the listed amounts. The 2014 portion is the first one, so that's correct. The user might be looking for the amount due within the next fiscal year, which aligns with the 2014 entry. Therefore, the portion due in the next 12 months is $11,057.\n</think>\n\nThe portion of future minimum lease payments due in the next 12 months corresponds to the fiscal year 2014, which is **$11,057**.

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking for the percent change in principal transactions revenue related to interest rate risks from 2016 to 2017. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the context provided. The table has rows for different types of risks. The first row under \"interest rate risks (1)\" shows the values for 2018, 2017, and 2016 as $5186 million, $5301 million, and $4229 million respectively. \n\nThe question is about the change from 2016 to 2017. So the numbers we need are 2017's value ($5301 million) and 2016's value ($4229 million). \n\nTo calculate the percent change, the formula is ((New Value - Old Value) / Old Value) * 100. Here, the new value is 2017's figure, and the old value is 2016's. \n\nSo subtracting 4229 from 5301 gives 1072. Then divide that by 4229. Let me do the division: 1072 / 4229 \u2248 0.2535. Multiplying by 100 gives approximately 25.35%. \n\nWait, let me check the numbers again. The 2016 value is $4229 million, and 2017 is $5301 million. The difference is indeed 5301 - 4229 = 1072. Dividing 1072 by 4229. Let me calculate that more precisely. 4229 * 0.25 is 1057.25. So 1072 is a bit more than that. The exact value would be (1072 / 4229) * 100. Let me compute that. \n\nUsing a calculator: 1072 divided by 4229 equals approximately 0.2535. Multiply by 100 gives 25.35%. So the percent change is approximately 25.35%. \n\nThe",

      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the information provided, in May 2008, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana issued $375 million of 6.00% series first mortgage bonds due May 2018.\n\nTo calculate the annual interest expense related to these bonds, we can multiply the principal amount by the interest rate:\n\n$375 million x 0.06 = $22.5 million\n\nTherefore, the annual interest expense related to the series first mortgage bonds due May 2018 is $22.5 million.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out the annual interest expense for the 6.00% Series First Mortgage Bonds due May 2018 that Entergy Gulf States Louisiana issued in May 2008. The question is asking for the annual interest expense in millions.\n\nFirst, the context says they issued $375 million of these bonds with a 6.00% interest rate. To calculate the annual interest expense, I think you just multiply the principal by the interest rate. So $375 million times 6% would be $22.5 million per year. That seems straightforward. \n\nBut wait, I need to make sure there's no other information in the context that might affect this calculation. The context mentions that the proceeds were used to pay off other bonds, but the interest expense for the new bonds should be based on their face value and rate. The other bonds (the 3.6% series and the floating rate ones) have been paid off or assumed by Entergy Texas, so they shouldn't affect the current calculation. \n\nAlso, the note about the money pool and credit facilities doesn't seem relevant to calculating the interest expense on the 2018 bonds. The interest rate is fixed at 6%, so there's no floating rate component here. The answer should just be 375 million * 6% = 22.5 million annually. \n\nI don't see any other factors mentioned that would adjust this amount, like amortization of discounts or premiums, or changes in the interest rate. The bonds were issued at 6%, and that's the rate to use. So the annual interest expense is $22.5 million.\n</think>\n\nThe annual interest expense for the 6.00% Series First Mortgage Bonds due May 2018 is calculated by multiplying the principal amount ($375 million) by the stated interest rate (6.00%). \n\n**Calculation:**  \n$375 million \u00d7 6.00% = **$22.5 million**.\n\nThis amount represents the fixed annual interest payment for these bonds. \n\nAnswer: **22.5**",

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking by what percentage the average price of WTI crude oil increased from 2011 to 2013. I need to figure this out based on the provided context.\n\nFirst, I should look at the table given. The table has benchmark prices for different years. The rows are WTI crude oil, Brent crude oil, and Henry Hub natural gas. The columns are 2013, 2012, and 2011. \n\nLooking at the WTI crude oil row, the prices are $98.05 in 2013, $94.15 in 2012, and $95.11 in 2011. Wait, so in 2011 it was $95.11 and in 2013 it's $98.05. The question is about the increase from 2011 to 2013. \n\nTo calculate the percentage increase, the formula is ((New Value - Old Value)/Old Value) * 100. So here, the old value is 2011's price, which is $95.11, and the new value is 2013's price, $98.05. \n\nLet me do the subtraction first: 98.05 minus 95.11. That equals 2.94. Then divide that by the old value, 95.11. So 2.94 / 95.11. Let me calculate that. \n\nHmm, 2.94 divided by 95.11. Let me approximate. 95.11 times 0.03 is 2.8533. That's close to 2.94. So maybe around 3.09%? Let me check with exact numbers. \n\n2.94 divided by 95.11 equals approximately 0.0309. Multiply by 100 gives 3.09%. So the percentage increase is approximately 3.09%. \n\nWait, but let me confirm the numbers again. The 2011 price is $95.11 and 2013 is $98.",

The context provided has a table with data for December 2014 and December 2013.\n\nLooking at the table, the first row is labeled \"compensation and benefits\" with values \"$ 8368\" for 2014 and \"$ 7874\" for 2013. The question is straightforward: calculate the difference between these two numbers. \n\nSo, the 2014 value is 8368 million, and the 2013 value is 7874 million. To find the change, subtract the 2013 value from the 2014 value. That would be 8368 minus 7874. Let me do the subtraction: 8368 - 7874. \n\nCalculating that: 8368 minus 7000 is 1368. Then subtract 874 more. 1368 - 874. Let's break it down: 1368 - 800 = 568, then subtract 74 more, which gives 494. So the change is 494 million. \n\nWait, but I should double-check the subtraction to be sure. Let me write it out:\n\n8368\n-7874\n--------\nStarting from the rightmost digits:\n8 - 4 = 4\n6 - 7.

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking what portion of the total net reserves is related to the London Market. Let me look at the context provided.\n\nFirst, there's a table with different categories. The columns are \"total reserves\" and then some other entries. The rows are \"gross [1] [2]\", then \"direct\", \"assumed reinsurance\", \"london market\", \"total\", \"ceded\", and \"net\". \n\nUnder the \"gross\" row, the total is 367. Then there's a \"ceded\" entry of -47, which is in parentheses as (47). The net is 320. So the net reserves total is $320.\n\nNow, looking at the breakdown under \"gross\", the London Market is listed as 57. But wait, the question is about net reserves. The London Market figure here is part of the gross. But how does ceded affect this? The ceded amount is subtracted from the total gross to get the net. \n\nBut the problem is, the London Market is part of the gross. The ceded amount is a total subtraction from all gross reserves. So to find the net related to London Market, do we take the London Market's gross amount and subtract a portion of the ceded? Or is the ceded amount applied to the total gross, and then the net is total gross minus ceded?\n\nLooking at the table structure: The total gross is 367, which is the sum of direct (271) + assumed reinsurance (39) + London Market (57). Then ceded is -47, leading to net of 320. But the ceded is a total amount, not broken down by category. So the net is total gross minus total ceded. Therefore, the London Market's contribution to net reserves would be its gross amount (57) minus any ceded related to it. However, the problem is that the ceded amount isn't broken down by category.
