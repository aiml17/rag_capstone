That would be adding up the three years. Let me check the numbers again to make sure. 2013 is $137 million, 2014 is $132 million, and 2015 is $136 million. Adding those together: 137 + 132 + 136. Let me do the math. \n\n137 + 132 is 269. Then 269 + 136 is 405. So the total rent expense from 2013 to 2015 would be $405 million. \n\nWait, but the user is asking for the value in million dollars. The answer should be 405 million. Let me confirm that the numbers are correctly assigned to each year. The text says \"2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\" So the first number is 2015, then 2014, then 2013. So the numbers are 136 (2015), 132 (2014), 137 (2013).

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking for the portion of future minimum lease payments due in the next 12 months. The context provided has a table with fiscal years and the corresponding payments.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which of those fiscal years fall within the next 12 months from the reference date. The reference date here is May 31, 2013, as mentioned in the context. The next 12 months from that date would be up to May 31, 2014. \n\nLooking at the table, the first fiscal year listed is 2014, which ends on May 31, 2014. The payment for 2014 is $11,057. Then 2015 is next, but that would be beyond the 12-month window. So, the only portion due in the next 12 months is the 2014 payment. \n\nWait, but I should check if there's any other payments within that period. The context lists the fiscal years ending May 31, so each entry corresponds to the fiscal year. The 2014 fiscal year is from June 1, 2013, to May 31, 2014. But the next 12 months from May 31, 2013, would be up to May 31, 2014. Therefore, the entire 2014 fiscal year's lease payment is due within that next 12 months. \n\nSo the answer should be $11,057. Let me confirm there's no other entries. The other years start after that. The \"thereafter\" category is for payments beyond 2018, so they're not included. Therefore, the correct amount is $11,057.\n</think>\n\nThe portion of future minimum lease payments due in the next 12 months (as of May 31, 2013) corresponds to the fiscal year 2014, which is **$11,057**.

The context says that Entergy Gulf States Louisiana issued $375 million of these bonds in May 2008. The interest rate is 6.00%. \n\nSo, annual interest expense is typically calculated by multiplying the principal amount by the interest rate. The principal here is $375 million, and the rate is 6%. Let me do that math. \n\nFirst, 6% of $375 million. To calculate that, I can convert the percentage to decimal, which is 0.06. Then multiply 375,000,000 by 0.06. \n\n375,000,000 * 0.06 = 22,500,000. \n\nSo that would be $22.5 million per year. \n\nWait, but I need to check if there's any other information that might affect this. The context mentions that the proceeds were used to pay off other bonds, but the question is specifically about the interest expense related to the 2018 bonds. Since the 6% bonds are the ones in question, and their principal is $375 million, the interest should just be 6% of that. \n\nAlso, the other bonds mentioned (the 3.6% series and the floating rate series) are being paid off, but they are not the ones we're focusing on here. The question is only about the 2018 bonds. \n\nI don't see any mention of discounts or premiums on the issuance that would affect the interest expense calculation. The problem states the rate is 6%, so it's straightforward. \n\nTherefore, the annual interest expense should be $22.5 million.\n</think>\n\nThe annual interest expense for the 6.00% Series First Mortgage Bonds due May 2018 is calculated by multiplying the principal amount ($375 million) by the interest rate (6.00%). \n\n**Calculation:**  \n$375 million \u00d7 6.00% = **$22.5 million**.\n\n**Answer:** 22.5 million.",

The context provided mentions the average annual WTI, but I need to check if there are specific numbers given for 2011 and 2013.\n\nLooking through the context, the first part talks about the percentage of sweet crude oil production in North America E&P. It says that in 2013, sweet crude averaged 76%, compared to 63% in 2012 and 42% in 2011. Wait, that's about the percentage of sweet crude, not the WTI price itself. The context also mentions that the quality and location affect price realizations, but the actual WTI prices aren't listed here. \n\nThe user is asking for the percentage increase in the average WTI price from 2011 to 2013. However, the provided context doesn't include the actual price numbers for WTI in those years. The only percentages mentioned are related to the sweet crude production percentages. There's a mention of \"the average annual WTI\" but no specific values. \n\nHmm, maybe I missed something. Let me check again. The context starts with \"location 2013 in recent years, crude oil sold along the u.s.\" and then discusses the quality differences affecting prices. The key part about WTI is in the first paragraph, but there's no numerical data on WTI prices for 2011 and 2013. The percentages given are about the proportion of sweet crude, not the price changes of WTI itself.\n\nSince the context doesn't provide the actual WTI prices for 2011 and 2013, I can't calculate the percentage increase. The answer would require data that's not present here. The user might have intended to include that data but forgot, or maybe it's in another part of the document not provided.

The question is asking for the change in compensation and benefits liability between 2014 and 2013, in millions.\n\nLooking at the context provided, there's a table with different line items.

The second row is [\"compensation and benefits\", \"$ 8368\", \"$ 7874\"]. \n\nSo, the compensation and benefits for 2014 is $8,368 million and for 2013 it's $7,874 million.

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking what portion of the total net reserves is related to the London Market. Let me look at the context provided.\n\nFirst, there's a table with different categories. The total reserves are listed under \"gross\" with subcategories: direct ($271), assumed reinsurance ($39), and London Market ($57). The total gross is $367. Then they cede $47, so the net is $320.\n\nThe question is about the portion of the net reserves related to London Market. So, the London Market's gross is $57. But since there's ceded reserves of $47, does that affect the London Market portion? Wait, the ceded amount is subtracted from the total gross to get the net. But the ceded amount is a total figure, not broken down by category. Hmm.\n\nThe problem is whether the ceded reserves are allocated per category or not. The table shows \"ceded\" as -47 (47) and net as $320. The ceded amount is likely the total ceded across all categories. So, to find the net for London Market, we need to know if the ceded reserves are applied proportionally or if the London Market's ceded is part of that total. But the context doesn't specify how the ceded reserves are split between direct, assumed reinsurance, and London Market. \n\nAssuming that the ceded reserves are applied to the total gross, and the net is total gross minus total ceded. The London Market's gross is $57. If the ceded is not specifically allocated to London Market, then the net for London Market would still be $57? But that doesn't make sense because ceded reserves are usually related to reinsurance, which could be part of the gross reserves. Wait, maybe the ceded amount is subtracted from the total gross, so each category's net is their gross minus any ceded related to them. However, the table doesn't break down ceded by category. \n\nIn the absence of specific information, perhaps the question expects us to take the London Market's gross amount ($57) and divide it by the total net ($320).
