      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the information provided in the context, the portion of the total bankruptcy settlement obligations that are related to labor-related deemed claims is $849 million.\n\nThe context states that \"the remaining liability to certain american labor groups and employees of $ 849 million is based upon the estimated fair value of the shares of aag common stock expected to be issued in satisfaction of such obligation\".\n\nThe total bankruptcy settlement obligations are listed as:\n- \"AAG Series A Preferred Stock\": $3,329 million\n- \"Single-dip Equity Obligations\": $1,246 million\n- \"Labor-related Deemed Claim\": $849 million\n- Total: $5,424 million\n\nTherefore, the labor-related deemed claim of $849 million represents approximately 15.6% of the total $5,424 million in bankruptcy settlement obligations.",
      "generated_response": "To find the portion of the total bankruptcy settlement obligations related to labor deemed claims, we need to know the total amount of bankruptcy settlement obligations and the amount related to labor deemed claims.\n\nThe total amount of bankruptcy settlement obligations is not explicitly stated in the provided context, but we can infer some information. We know that the fair value of the labor deemed claims was approximately $1.7 billion. We also know that as of December 31, 2013, the remaining liability for labor deemed claims was $849 million.\n\nHowever, without the total amount of bankruptcy settlement obligations, we cannot directly calculate the portion related to labor deemed claims. \n\nBut we can calculate the portion based on the information given about the initial distribution and the remaining liability. The initial distribution was $595 million in common stock and $300 million in cash for payroll taxes, totaling $895 million. The remaining liability is $849 million. \n\nSo, the total amount related to labor deemed claims is $1.744 billion ($895 million initial distribution + $849 million remaining liability). \n\nUnfortunately, without the total bankruptcy settlement obligations, we cannot calculate the exact portion. However, if we consider the fair value of $1.7 billion as a significant portion of the total claims and other bankruptcy settlement obligations, we can estimate that labor deemed claims make up a substantial part of the total obligations. \n\nTo give a precise answer, more information about the total bankruptcy settlement obligations would be necessary.",
