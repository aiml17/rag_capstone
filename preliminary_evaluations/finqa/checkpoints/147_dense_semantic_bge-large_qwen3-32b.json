      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking for the value of rent expense and certain office equipment expense under lease agreements between 2013 and 2015. The context provided has some numbers here.\n\nLooking at the context, there's a section that says: \"rent expense and certain office equipment expense under lease agreements amounted to $136 million, $132 million and $137 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\" \n\nWait, the order here is 2015, 2014, 2013. Let me parse that again. The numbers are given as $136 million for 2015, $132 million for 2014, and $137 million for 2013. The question is asking for the total between 2013 and 2015. So that would be adding up the three years: 2013 ($137M) + 2014 ($132M) + 2015 ($136M). Let me check the numbers again to make sure I didn't mix them up. The sentence says \"amounted to $136 million, $132 million and $137 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\" So yes, 2015 is 136, 2014 is 132, 2013 is 137. Adding them together: 137 + 132 is 269, plus 136 is 405. So total is $405 million. The answer should be 405 million dollars. Let me confirm there's no other numbers in the context that might be relevant. The rest talks about operating lease commitments, future minimum commitments, capital commitments, etc., but the rent expense is specifically covered in that section. So the answer is 405.\n</think>\n\nThe value of rent expense and certain office equipment expense under lease agreements between 2013 and 2015 is calculated by summing the expenses for each year:  \n- **2013**: $137 million",

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking for the portion of future minimum lease payments that are due in the next 12 months. The context provided includes a list of future minimum lease payments for non-cancelable operating leases as of May 31, 2013.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what the next 12 months from the current date would be. Since the context is as of May 31, 2013, the next 12 months would be from June 1, 2013, to May 31, 2014. But the lease payments listed are for fiscal years ending May 31 each year. The first fiscal year listed is 2014, which would cover from June 1, 2013, to May 31, 2014. Wait, but the fiscal years here might be different. Let me check the context again.\n\nThe context lists the future minimum lease payments for fiscal years ending May 31. The first entry is for 2014 with $11,057. Then 2015, 2016, etc. So the fiscal year 2014 would be the first year after May 31, 2013. Since the question is about the next 12 months from May 31, 2013, the next fiscal year (2014) would cover the next 12 months. Therefore, the amount due in the next 12 months is the amount listed for 2014, which is $11,057.\n\nWait, but sometimes companies have different fiscal years. However, in this case, the context says \"fiscal years ending May 31,\" so each fiscal year is from June to May. So the next fiscal year (2014) would start on June 1, 2013, and end on May 31, 2014. Therefore, the entire amount for 2014 ($11,057) is due within the next 12 months from May 31, 2013. The subsequent years (2015 onwards) would be beyond that 12-month period. So the answer should be $11",

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking for the percent change in principal transactions revenue related to interest rate risks from 2016 to 2017. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the context provided. The table has rows for different risk categories. The first row under \"interest rate risks (1)\" shows the values for 2018, 2017, and 2016 as $5186 million, $5301 million, and $4229 million respectively.\n\nSo, the question is about the change from 2016 to 2017. The 2016 value is $4229 million, and in 2017 it's $5301 million. To find the percent change, I remember the formula is ((New Value - Old Value)/Old Value) * 100. \n\nLet me plug in the numbers. New Value here is 2017's $5301, and Old Value is 2016's $4229. Subtracting 4229 from 5301 gives 1072. Then divide that by 4229. Let me calculate that: 1072 / 4229 \u2248 0.2535. Multiply by 100 to get the percentage, which is approximately 25.35%. \n\nWait, let me double-check the subtraction. 5301 minus 4229: 5301 - 4200 is 1101, then subtract 29 more gives 1072. Yes, that's right. The division: 1072 divided by 4229. Let me do that more accurately. 4229 times 0.25 is 1057.25. That's close to 1072. The difference is 1072 - 1057.25 = 14.75. So 14.75 / 4229 \u2248 0.0035. So total is approximately 25.35%. So rounding to two decimal places, maybe 25.35%. Depending",

The context says that Entergy Gulf States Louisiana issued $375 million of these bonds. The interest rate is 6.00%, so I think the annual interest expense would just be 6% of $375 million.\n\nWait, let me make sure there's no other details affecting this. The context mentions that the proceeds were used to pay off other bonds, but the question is specifically about the interest expense related to the May 2018 bonds. Since the interest rate is fixed at 6%, and the principal is $375 million, the annual interest should be straightforward. \n\nCalculating that: 375,000,000 * 0.06 = 22,500,000. So that's $22.5 million per year. \n\nI don't see any mention of discounts, premiums, or other factors that might affect the interest expense. The bonds are straightforward with a fixed rate. The other information about paying off previous bonds doesn't seem relevant here.

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking by what percentage the average price of WTI crude oil increased from 2011 to 2013. I need to figure this out based on the provided context.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the context for the WTI prices in those years. The table shows the WTI crude oil prices as $95.11 in 2011 and $98.05 in 2013. Wait, actually, the table lists the years 2011, 2012, 2013. Let me check again. The first row under the benchmark is WTI crude oil. The years are 2013, 2012, 2011. The values are $98.05 for 2013, $94.15 for 2012, and $95.11 for 2011. So the 2011 price is $95.11 and 2013 is $98.05.\n\nTo calculate the percentage increase, I need to use the formula: ((New Value - Old Value) / Old Value) * 100. So here, the old value is 2011's $95.11, and the new value is 2013's $98.05. \n\nSubtracting 95.11 from 98.05 gives 2.94. Then divide that by 95.11. Let me do the division: 2.94 / 95.11. Let me calculate that. Let's see, 95.11 times 0.03 is 2.8533. That's close to 2.94. So maybe approximately 3.09%. Let me check with exact numbers.\n\n2.94 divided by 95.11 equals approximately 0.0309. Multiply by 100 gives 3.09%. So the percentage increase is roughly 3.09%. The question asks for the percentage, so I should round it appropriately. Maybe to one decimal place, so 3.1%. But let me verify the exact calculation again.\n\nCalcul",

Then there's \"direct\" with $271, \"assumed reinsurance\" $39, \"London market\" $57, and the total is $367. Then ceded is -47, so net is $320.\n\nWait, the question is about net reserves.

But does the ceded amount apply to all categories or just specific ones?\n\nLooking at the context, the ceded is listed as \"-47 (47)\", which might mean that the total ceded is $47. But the problem is whether the London Market's portion is adjusted by any ceded amount. The table shows \"total\" as 367, then ceded is -47, leading to net 320.
