      "ground_truth_answer": "In 2004, the total shareholder return for Snap-on Incorporated was $130.66 and for the peer group it was $152.42. \n\nTo find the ratio of Snap-on Incorporated to the peer group performance in 2004, we can divide the total shareholder return for Snap-on Incorporated by the total shareholder return for the peer group:\n\nRatio = $130.66 / $152.42 = 0.8577\n\nTherefore, the ratio of Snap-on Incorporated to the peer group performance in 2004 was approximately 0.858.",
