The context provided mentions those expenses for 2015, 2014, and 2013. Let me check the exact numbers.\n\nLooking at the context, it says: \"rent expense and certain office equipment expense under lease agreements amounted to $136 million, $132 million and $137 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\" So the numbers are given for each of those years. The user wants the total between 2013 and 2015. That would be adding up the three years: 137 (2013) + 132 (2014) + 136 (2015). Let me add those up. \n\n137 + 132 is 269, and then adding 136 gives 269 + 136 = 405. So the total is $405 million. I need to make sure there's no other information that might affect this, but the context only provides those three figures for the three years. The answer should be 405 million dollars.\n</think>\n\nThe value of rent expense and certain office equipment expense under lease agreements between 2013 and 2015 is calculated by summing the amounts for each year:  \n- **2013**: $137 million  \n- **2014**: $132 million  \n- **2015**: $136 million  \n\n**Total**: $137 + $132 + $136 = **$405 million**.  \n\nAnswer: **405** million $.",

      "ground_truth_answer": "In 2014, the total net revenue was $94,205 million. Net interest income was $43,634 million.\n\nTo calculate the percentage of total net revenue due to net interest income in 2014:\n(Net Interest Income / Total Net Revenue) x 100\n= ($43,634 / $94,205) x 100\n\u2248 46.3%\n\nTherefore, about 46.3% of the total net revenue in 2014 was due to net interest income.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking what percentage of total net revenue was due to net interest income in 2014. Alright, so I need to find the numbers for net interest income and total net revenue for that year.\n\nLooking at the context provided, there's a table with various revenue streams. The rows include \"net interest income\" and \"total net revenue\". For 2014, the net interest income is listed as $43,634 million. The total net revenue for 2014 is $94,205 million. \n\nSo the formula to calculate the percentage would be (Net Interest Income / Total Net Revenue) * 100. Plugging in the numbers: (43,634 / 94,205) * 100. Let me do that calculation. \n\nFirst, divide 43,634 by 94,205. Let me check that. Let me approximate. 43,634 divided by 94,205. Well, 43,634 is roughly half of 94,205. Let me compute it more accurately. \n\nUsing a calculator, 43,634 \u00f7 94,205 \u2248 0.4632. Multiplying by 100 gives approximately 46.32%. \n\nWait, let me verify the numbers again. The total net revenue is 94,205, which is the sum of noninterest revenue (50,571) and net interest income (43,634). Adding those gives 50,571 + 43,634 = 94,205, which matches the total. So the numbers are correct. \n\nTherefore, the percentage is approximately 46.3%. Depending on rounding, maybe they expect it to one decimal place. Let me check the exact division again. 43,634 divided by 94,205. Let me compute this more precisely. \n\nDividing 43,634 by 94,205: \n\nLet me do this step by step. \n\nFirst, 94,205 \u00d7 0.46 = 94,",

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out the annual interest expense related to the Series First Mortgage Bonds due May 2018. The context mentions that in May 2008, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana issued $375 million of 6.00% Series First Mortgage Bonds due May 2018. The question is asking for the annual interest expense on these bonds.\n\nFirst, I know that interest expense for bonds is typically calculated by multiplying the principal amount by the interest rate. The principal here is $375 million, and the rate is 6.00%. So, 375 million times 6% should give the annual interest. Let me do that calculation: 375 * 0.06 equals 22.5. So that would be $22.5 million per year.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure there aren't any other factors mentioned in the context that might affect this. The context says the proceeds were used to pay off other bonds and for general corporate purposes. However, the interest expense on the new bonds should still be based on their face value and stated rate. There's no mention of discounts, premiums, or amortization that would change the interest expense calculation. Also, since the bonds were issued in May 2008, the first full year of interest would be from May 2008 to May 2009, but the question asks for the annual interest expense, which is likely the full year's interest based on the principal and rate. \n\nThe answer should be straightforward: 375 million * 6% = 22.5 million.

The first column is the category, then as of December 2014 and 2013. \n\nLooking at the table, compensation and benefits for 2014 is $8,368 million and for 2013 it's $7,874 million.

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking what portion of the total net reserves is related to the London Market. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the context provided. There's a table mentioned with environmental reserves as of December 31, 2011. The table includes categories like Direct, Assumed Reinsurance, London Market, Total, Ceded, and Net. \n\nLooking at the numbers: The London Market is listed as $57. The total gross is 367, but then there's a ceded amount of -47, leading to a net of $320. The question is about the portion of the total net reserves related to London Market.\n\nWait, but the London Market figure in the table is part of the gross. How does that translate to net? The ceded amount is subtracted from the total gross to get the net. However, the problem is whether the London Market's portion is adjusted by ceded. The table shows that the London Market is part of the gross, but the ceded amount is listed after the total. So, the ceded amount is -47, which is subtracted from the total gross of 367 to get the net of 320. \n\nBut does the ceded amount apply to all categories, including London Market? The way the table is structured, the ceded is a total figure. The London Market's gross is 57. If the ceded is applied to the entire gross, then the net for each category would be their gross minus a proportion of the ceded? But that's not clear. Alternatively, maybe the ceded is only related to certain parts. However, the table shows that after totaling the gross (Direct 271 + Assumed 39 + London 57 = 367), then subtracting ceded 47, giving net 320. \n\nBut the question is about the portion of the net reserves related to London Market. If the ceded is a total, perhaps the London Market's net is its gross (57) minus some portion of the ceded. However, without more details on how the ceded is allocated, we can't split it. Therefore, maybe the London Market's net is just its gross (57) minus a portion of the ceded. But since the ceded is listed as -47 in total",

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking what portion of the total bankruptcy settlement obligations are related to labor deemed claims. The context provided has a table with different components of the \"claims and other bankruptcy settlement obligations\" as of December 31, 2013. The total is $5,424 million.\n\nLooking at the table, there's a line item called \"labor-related deemed claim\" which is $849 million. The question is specifically about the portion related to labor deemed claims. So I need to calculate the percentage of the total that $849 million represents.\n\nFirst, I'll take the labor-related deemed claim amount, which is $849 million, and divide it by the total obligations of $5,424 million. Then multiply by 100 to get the percentage. Let me do the math: 849 divided by 5424 equals approximately 0.1565. Multiplying by 100 gives 15.65%. \n\nBut wait, the answer might just need the exact numbers without converting to a percentage. Wait, the question says \"what portion,\" which could be in terms of the dollar amount or the percentage. The table lists the labor-related deemed claim as $849 million out of the total $5,424 million. The answer should probably state the dollar amount as the portion. The user might just want the value from the table. Let me check the context again.\n\nThe question is \"what portion of the total bankruptcy settlement obligations are related to labor deemed claims?\" The answer is the value listed under \"labor-related deemed claim\" in the table, which is $849 million. The total is $5,424 million. So the portion is $849 million. The answer is straightforward from the table. The calculation part was just to confirm, but the context already provides the numbers. So the answer is $849 million, which is approximately 15.65% of the total.
