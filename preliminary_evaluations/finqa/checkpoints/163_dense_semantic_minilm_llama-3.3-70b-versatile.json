The ceded amount is -$47, but this is a general figure and not specifically broken down by category.\n\nSince the ceded amount is not specifically broken down by category (direct, assumed reinsurance, London Market), and assuming the cession applies uniformly or its specifics are not detailed enough to adjust each category's contribution to the net reserves accurately, we can only estimate based on the gross figures provided.\n\nThe London Market's gross contribution to the total gross reserves is $57 out of $367 (total gross reserves). To find the net portion related to London Market without specific cession details for each category, we apply the same ratio to the net reserves:\n\nLondon Market's portion of the total gross = $57 / $367\nThis ratio is then applied to the total net reserves to estimate London Market's net portion:\n= ($57 / $367) * $320\n\nCalculating this gives:\n= (0.1551) * $320\n\u2248 $49.76\n\nSo, approximately $49.76 of the total net reserves is related to London Market, based on the gross reserves ratio and assuming uniform cession or lack of detailed cession data by category.",
