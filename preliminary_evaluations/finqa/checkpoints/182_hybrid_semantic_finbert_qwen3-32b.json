      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking for the value of rent expense and certain office equipment expense under lease agreements between 2013 and 2015. The context provided has some information about that.\n\nLooking at the context, there's a paragraph that says: \"rent expense and certain office equipment expense under lease agreements amounted to $136 million, $132 million and $137 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\" Wait, the order here is 2015, 2014, 2013. Let me parse that correctly. The numbers are given as 136, 132, 137 for 2015, 2014, 2013. So 2013 is $137 million, 2014 is $132 million, and 2015 is $136 million. \n\nThe question is asking for the total between 2013 and 2015. So I need to add those three numbers together. Let me check again to make sure I have them right. The sentence says \"in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\" Wait, the order is 2015, 2014, 2013. So the first number is 2015 ($136M), then 2014 ($132M), then 2013 ($137M). So adding them up: 136 + 132 + 137. Let me calculate that. \n\n136 + 132 is 268. Then 268 + 137 is 405. So the total rent expense from 2013 to 2015 would be $405 million. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other numbers in the context that might be relevant. The rest of the context talks about operating lease commitments, future minimum commitments, contingent payments, etc., but those don't seem to relate to the actual expenses incurred between 2013-2015.

The context provided has a table with fiscal years and the corresponding payments.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which years fall within the next 12 months from the reference date. The context mentions that the data is as of May 31, 2013. So the next 12 months would be from June 1, 2013, to May 31, 2014. \n\nLooking at the fiscal years listed: 2014, 2015, etc. The first year after May 31, 2013, is the fiscal year ending May 31, 2014. Since the next 12 months would include up to May 31, 2014, the relevant payment is for 2014, which is $11,057. \n\nI should check if there are any other years that might overlap. The next fiscal year is 2015, which ends May 31, 2015. But that's beyond the 12-month window. So only the 2014 amount is due within the next 12 months. \n\nThe answer should be $11,057.

The total future payments are $57,096, but the question is only about the next 12 months. \n\nNo other information in the context seems relevant to lease payments.

The user is asking for the percent change in principal transactions revenue related to interest rate risks from 2016 to 2017. \n\nFirst, I need to find the numbers for those two years. Looking at the table provided, under \"interest rate risks (1)\", the 2017 value is $5,301 million and the 2016 value is $4,229 million.\n\nThe formula for percent change is ((New Value - Old Value) / Old Value) * 100. So plugging in the numbers: (5301 - 4229) / 4229 * 100. Let me calculate that step by step.\n\nSubtracting 4229 from 5301 gives 1072. Then divide 1072 by 4229. Let me do that division. 1072 \u00f7 4229 \u2248 0.2535. Multiplying by 100 gives approximately 25.35%. \n\nWait, let me double-check the division. 4229 times 0.25 is 1057.25, which is close to 1072. So the exact value would be a bit higher than 25%. Maybe around 25.35% as I calculated. Rounding to two decimal places, that's 25.35%. But maybe the answer expects one decimal place, like 25.4%. Alternatively, the question might want it rounded to the nearest whole number. Let me check the original numbers again to make sure I didn't mix up the years. 2017 is $5,301 and 2016 is $4,229. Yes, correct. So the calculation is right. The percent change is approximately 25.35%, which I can round to 25.4% or 25.35% depending on the required precision.

      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the information provided, in May 2008, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana issued $375 million of 6.00% series first mortgage bonds due May 2018.\n\nTo calculate the annual interest expense related to these bonds, we can multiply the principal amount by the interest rate:\n\n$375 million x 0.06 = $22.5 million\n\nTherefore, the annual interest expense related to the series first mortgage bonds due May 2018 is $22.5 million.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out the annual interest expense for the 6.00% Series First Mortgage Bonds due May 2018. \n\nFirst, the context says that Entergy Gulf States Louisiana issued $375 million of these bonds in May 2008. The interest rate is 6.00%. To find the annual interest expense, I think I just need to multiply the principal amount by the interest rate.\n\nSo, $375 million multiplied by 6% (which is 0.06 in decimal) would be $22.5 million per year. That seems straightforward. \n\nWait, but I should check if there's any other information that might affect this calculation. The context mentions that the proceeds were used to pay off other bonds, but since we're only asked about the May 2018 bonds, those other payments probably don't affect the interest expense of the new bonds. The key numbers here are $375 million principal and 6% rate. \n\nAlso, the question is about annual interest expense. Since bonds typically pay interest annually, unless stated otherwise. The context doesn't mention any different payment terms, like semi-annual or quarterly, so assuming annual makes sense. \n\nSo, 375 * 0.06 = 22.5. Therefore, the annual interest expense should be $22.5 million.\n</think>\n\nThe annual interest expense for the 6.00% Series First Mortgage Bonds due May 2018 is calculated by multiplying the principal amount ($375 million) by the annual interest rate (6.00%). \n\n**Calculation:**  \n$375 million \u00d7 6.00% = $22.5 million.\n\n**Answer:** 22.5",
