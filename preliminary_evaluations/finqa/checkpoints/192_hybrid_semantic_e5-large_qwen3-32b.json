      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking for the value of rent expense and certain office equipment expense under lease agreements between 2013 and 2015. The context provided has some information about that.\n\nLooking at the context, there's a section that says: \"rent expense and certain office equipment expense under lease agreements amounted to $136 million, $132 million and $137 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\" Wait, the order here is 2015, 2014, 2013. Let me parse that again. The numbers are given as 136, 132, 137 for 2015, 2014, 2013. So 2013 is $137 million, 2014 is $132 million, and 2015 is $136 million. \n\nThe question is asking for the total between 2013 and 2015. So I need to add up the three years. Let me check the numbers again to make sure I have them right. The sentence says \"amounted to $136 million, $132 million and $137 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\" So respectively, meaning the first number corresponds to the first year mentioned. So 2015: 136, 2014:132, 2013:137. \n\nAdding them up: 137 (2013) + 132 (2014) + 136 (2015). Let me do the math. 137 + 132 is 269. Then 269 + 136 is 405. So the total rent expense from 2013 to 2015 would be $405 million. \n\nWait, but the question says \"between 2013 and 2015\". Does that include all three years? Yes, because between would typically include the start and end years if they are within that range. So",

The context provided has a list of future minimum lease payments for non-cancelable operating leases as of May 31, 2013.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which of the listed fiscal years fall within the next 12 months from the current date. But wait, when is the current date? The context mentions May 31, 2013, as the date of the information. The question is probably being asked in the context of that date. So, the next 12 months from May 31, 2013, would be up to May 31, 2014.\n\nLooking at the list, the fiscal years are ending on May 31 each year. The first entry is for 2014, which is the fiscal year ending May 31, 2014. That would cover the period from June 1, 2013, to May 31, 2014. But the next 12 months from May 31, 2013, would be from June 1, 2013, to May 31, 2014. So the entire 2014 fiscal year's lease payment of $11,057 would be due within the next 12 months. \n\nWait, but sometimes when they list future lease payments, the first year is the next fiscal year. Let me confirm. The context says \"future minimum lease payments for all non-cancelable operating leases at May 31, 2013.\" The first entry is 2014 with $11,057. So that's the amount due in the fiscal year 2014, which is the next fiscal year after May 31, 2013. Since the next 12 months from May 31, 2013, would cover up to May 31, 2014, the entire 2014 amount is due within that period. \n\nTherefore, the portion due in the next 12 months is $11,057.

The question is asking for the percent change in principal transactions revenue associated with interest rate risks from 2016 to 2017. \n\nFirst, I need to find the values for interest rate risks in those years. Looking at the table provided, the row for \"interest rate risks (1)\" has the numbers. For 2017, it's $5301 million, and for 2016, it's $4229 million.\n\nThe formula for percent change is ((New Value - Old Value) / Old Value) * 100. So here, the new value is 2017's figure, and the old value is 2016's. \n\nCalculating the difference: 5301 - 4229 = 1072. Then divide that by 4229. Let me do that division. 1072 divided by 4229. Let me approximate. 4229 times 0.25 is 1057.25. So 1072 is a bit more than that. Maybe around 0.2535 or so. Multiplying by 100 gives approximately 25.35%. \n\nWait, let me check the exact calculation. 1072 / 4229. Let me compute this more accurately. Let's see, 4229 * 0.25 = 1057.25.

      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the information provided, in May 2008, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana issued $375 million of 6.00% series first mortgage bonds due May 2018.\n\nTo calculate the annual interest expense related to these bonds, we can multiply the principal amount by the interest rate:\n\n$375 million x 0.06 = $22.5 million\n\nTherefore, the annual interest expense related to the series first mortgage bonds due May 2018 is $22.5 million.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out the annual interest expense for the 6% Series First Mortgage Bonds due May 2018. The context says that Entergy Gulf States Louisiana issued $375 million of these bonds in May 2008. The interest rate is 6.00%. \n\nSo, the interest expense for a bond is typically calculated as the principal amount multiplied by the interest rate. Since it's an annual rate, we can just do that calculation. Let me check if there's any mention of semi-annual payments or something, but the context doesn't specify that. The question asks for the annual interest expense.\n\nSo, the principal is $375 million. The rate is 6%. Let me compute that: 375 * 0.06 = 22.5. So that would be $22.5 million per year. \n\nWait, the context mentions that the proceeds were used to pay off other bonds. But the question is specifically about the interest expense related to the May 2018 bonds. So even though they used the proceeds to pay other debts, the interest on the $375 million bond itself would be based on its face value and rate. \n\nI don't see any other details that would affect the interest calculation, like discounts or premiums. The bonds were issued at par, I assume, since they're referred to as 6% and the proceeds match the face value. So the answer should be 375 million * 6% = 22.5 million annually. \n\nLet me double-check the numbers. 375 million times 0.06 is indeed 22.5. The answer should be $22.5 million.\n</think>\n\nThe annual interest expense for the 6.00% Series First Mortgage Bonds due May 2018 is calculated by multiplying the principal amount ($375 million) by the annual interest rate (6.00%). \n\n**Calculation:**  \n$375 million \u00d7 6.00% = $22.5 million.\n\n**Answer:** 22.5",

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking for the percentage increase in the average price of WTI crude oil from 2011 to 2013. First, I need to find the WTI prices for those years from the provided table.\n\nLooking at the table, under \"wti crude oil ( dollars per bbl )\", the values are $98.05 in 2013 and $95.11 in 2011. Wait, actually, the years are listed as 2013, 2012, 2011 in the headers. Let me double-check. The first row under the benchmark is WTI crude oil with prices for 2013 as $98.05, 2012 as $94.15, and 2011 as $95.11. So 2011 is $95.11 and 2013 is $98.05.\n\nTo calculate the percentage increase, the formula is ((New Value - Old Value)/Old Value) * 100. So here, New Value is 2013's $98.05 and Old Value is 2011's $95.11. \n\nSubtracting 95.11 from 98.05 gives 2.94. Then divide that by 95.11. Let me compute that: 2.94 / 95.11 \u2248 0.0309. Multiply by 100 to get the percentage, which is approximately 3.09%. \n\nSo the average price increased by about 3.09% from 2011 to 2013. Let me check if I did the calculation right. Yes, because 95.11 * 1.0309 \u2248 95.11 + 2.94 \u2248 98.05. That seems correct. The answer should be approximately 3.1% when rounded.\n</think>\n\nThe average price of WTI crude oil in 2011 was $95.11 per barrel, and in 2013, it was $98.05 per barrel.",
