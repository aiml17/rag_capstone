Let me parse that correctly. The numbers are given as 136, 132, 137 for 2015, 2014, 2013. So for 2013 it's $137 million, 2014 is $132 million, and 2015 is $136 million. \n\nThe question is asking for the total between 2013 and 2015. So adding those three numbers together: 137 + 132 + 136. Let me check that again. Wait, the text says \"2015, 2014 and 2013 respectively.\" So the first number is 2015: 136, then 2014: 132, then 2013: 137. So adding them all up: 136 + 132 + 137. Let me calculate that. \n\n136 + 132 is 268. Then 268 + 137 is 405. So the total rent expense from 2013 to 2015 would be $405 million. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other numbers in the context related to this. The rest of the context talks about operating lease commitments, future minimum commitments, capital commitments, interest payments, etc., but those don't seem relevant to the rent expense for those three years.

The context provided includes a list of future minimum lease payments for non-cancelable operating leases as of May 31, 2013.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which of the listed fiscal years fall within the next 12 months from the date of the context. The context is as of May 31, 2013, so the next 12 months would be from June 1, 2013, to May 31, 2014. \n\nLooking at the fiscal years provided, the first year listed is 2014, which ends on May 31.

The subsequent years (2015, 2016, etc.) are beyond that 12-month window. \n\nSo the answer should be the amount listed for 2014, which is $11,057.

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking for the percent change in principal transactions revenue related to interest rate risks from 2016 to 2017. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the context provided. The table has rows for different risk categories. The first row under \"interest rate risks (1)\" shows the values for 2018, 2017, and 2016 as $5186 million, $5301 million, and $4229 million respectively.\n\nThe question is about the change from 2016 to 2017. So the numbers we need are 2017's value ($5301 million) and 2016's value ($4229 million). \n\nTo calculate the percent change, the formula is ((New Value - Old Value)/Old Value) * 100. Here, the new value is 2017's figure, and the old value is 2016's. \n\nSo subtracting 4229 from 5301 gives 1072. Then divide that by 4229. Let me do the division: 1072 / 4229 \u2248 0.2535. Multiplying by 100 gives approximately 25.35%. \n\nWait, let me check the calculation again. 4229 times 1.25 would be 5286.25, which is close to 5301. The exact calculation: 5301 - 4229 = 1072. 1072 divided by 4229 equals approximately 0.2535, so 25.35%. Rounding to two decimal places, that's 25.35%. \n\nI should make sure there's no mistake in the numbers. The 2016 value is definitely $4229 million and 2017 is $5301 million.

Wait, the first column is \"in millions\", so the numbers are in millions of dollars. But for percentage change, the actual units don't matter as long as they're consistent, which they are here.\n\nThe formula for percentage change is [(New Value - Old Value) / Old Value] * 100. Here, the new value is 2012's collateral posted, which is 24,296 million, and the old value is 2011's 29,002 million. \n\nSo subtracting 29,002 from 24,296 gives a difference of -4,706. Then divide that by the old value (29,002) which gives approximately -0.1623. Multiplying by 100 gives about -16.23%. \n\nThe negative sign indicates a decrease. So the percentage change is a decrease of 16.23%. The user might want the answer as a positive number with a note that it's a decrease, but the question just asks for the percentage change, so the negative sign is appropriate here.\n\nLet me double-check the numbers.

      "question": "what is the annual interest expense related to series first mortgage bonds due may 2018 , in millions?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the information provided, in May 2008, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana issued $375 million of 6.00% series first mortgage bonds due May 2018.\n\nTo calculate the annual interest expense related to these bonds, we can multiply the principal amount by the interest rate:\n\n$375 million x 0.06 = $22.5 million\n\nTherefore, the annual interest expense related to the series first mortgage bonds due May 2018 is $22.5 million.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out the annual interest expense for the 6% Series First Mortgage Bonds due May 2018. The context says that Entergy Gulf States Louisiana issued $375 million of these bonds in May 2008 with a 6.00% interest rate. The question is asking for the annual interest expense related to these bonds.\n\nFirst, I know that interest expense for bonds is typically calculated by multiplying the principal amount by the interest rate. Since these are annual payments, the rate given is probably the annual rate. So, the calculation should be straightforward: $375 million multiplied by 6%.\n\nLet me check if there's any other information that might affect this calculation. The context mentions that the proceeds were used to pay off other bonds, but that shouldn't affect the interest expense on the new bonds. The other details about bonds due in 2008 and 2008's payments don't seem relevant here. The key numbers are the $375 million principal and the 6% rate.\n\nSo, doing the math: 375,000,000 * 0.06 = 22,500,000. That would be $22.5 million annually. The question asks for the answer in millions, so it should be 22.5 million.\n\nWait, but the answer needs to be in millions. The answer would be 22.5. Let me make sure there's no other factor. The bonds were issued in May 2008, so for the first year, maybe there would be prorated interest, but the question is asking for the annual interest expense. Since bonds typically have annual interest payments, even if issued mid-year, the full annual expense would be based on the principal and rate. However, in financial statements, sometimes interest is accrued for the portion of the year, but the question seems to ask for the annual rate. Since the rate is 6%, the annual interest expense would be 6% of 375 million regardless of when the bonds were issued. Therefore, $22.5 million is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe annual interest expense for the 6.00% Series First Mortgage Bonds due May 2018 is calculated by multiplying the principal amount ($375 million) by the interest rate (6.",

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking for the percentage increase in the average price of WTI crude oil from 2011 to 2013. First, I need to find the prices for those years from the provided context.\n\nLooking at the table, the WTI crude oil prices are listed as $95.11 in 2011 and $98.05 in 2013. Wait, the table has 2013, 2012, 2011 as the years. Let me confirm the order. The first row is [\"benchmark\", \"2013\", \"2012\", \"2011\"], then the WTI row is [\"wti crude oil...\", \"$98.05\", \"$94.15\", \"$95.11\"]. So the 2011 price is $95.11, 2013 is $98.05. \n\nTo calculate the percentage increase, the formula is ((New Value - Old Value)/Old Value) * 100. So here, New Value is 2013's $98.05, Old Value is 2011's $95.11. \n\nSubtracting: 98.05 - 95.11 = 2.94. Then divide by 95.11: 2.94 / 95.11 \u2248 0.0309. Multiply by 100 to get percentage: 3.09%. So approximately a 3.1% increase. \n\nWait, but let me check the numbers again. The 2011 price is $95.11, 2013 is $98.05. The difference is indeed $2.94. Dividing that by the original 2011 price gives roughly 3.09%. Rounding to one decimal place, that's 3.1%. \n\nI should make sure there's no other data in the context that might affect this.

The context provided has a table with data for December 2014 and December 2013.\n\nFirst, I need to locate the row for \"compensation and benefits\" in the table. Looking at the context, the second row is [\"compensation and benefits\", \"$ 8368\", \"$ 7874\"]. The numbers here are in millions, as indicated by the first row [\"$ in millions\", ...]. \n\nSo for 2014 (as of December 2014), the compensation and benefits liability is $8,368 million.

That would be 8368 minus 7874. Let me do the calculation: 8368 - 7874. Let's see, 8000 - 7874 is 126, and then add the remaining 368 from 8368. Wait, maybe breaking it down differently. 7874 + 494 = 8368? Let me check again. 7874 + 494: 7874 + 400 is 8274, plus 94 is 8368. Yes, that's right. So the change is +494 million.\n\nWait, but the answer should be the difference. So 8368 - 7874 equals 494. So the change is an increase of $494 million. The question is just asking for the numerical change, not the percentage. The answer should be 494 million.
