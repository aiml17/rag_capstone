The context provided has some numbers here.\n\nLooking at the context, there's a sentence that says: \"rent expense and certain office equipment expense under lease agreements amounted to $136 million, $132 million and $137 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\" Wait, the order here is 2015, 2014, 2013. So, breaking that down:\n\n- 2013: $137 million\n- 2014: $132 million\n- 2015: $136 million\n\nThe question is asking for the total between 2013 and 2015. So adding those three numbers together: 137 + 132 + 136. Let me check that again. \n\n137 (2013) + 132 (2014) is 269. Then adding 136 (2015) gives 269 + 136 = 405. So the total would be $405 million. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other numbers in the context that might be relevant. The rest of the context talks about future commitments and other financial details, but the specific numbers for 2013-2015 are only those three figures.

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking about the portion of future minimum lease payments due in the next 12 months. The context provided has a table with fiscal years and the corresponding payments.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which of those fiscal years fall within the next 12 months from the date mentioned. The context says the data is as of May 31, 2013. The next 12 months from that date would be up to May 31, 2014. Looking at the fiscal years listed, the first one is 2014, which is $11,057. Since 2014 is the next fiscal year after 2013, and the payments are for non-cancelable operating leases, the amount due in the next 12 months should be the 2014 payment. \n\nWait, but I need to confirm if the fiscal year 2014 here refers to the entire year or just the next 12 months. Since the payments are listed by fiscal years ending May 31, each entry corresponds to the amount due for that entire fiscal year. However, the question is about the next 12 months from May 31, 2013. The fiscal year 2014 runs from June 1, 2013, to May 31, 2014. So the entire 2014 fiscal year's payment is due within the next 12 months. Therefore, the answer should be $11,057. \n\nI should check if there's any other entry that might contribute. The \"thereafter\" category is for amounts beyond 2018, so that's not part of the next 12 months. The other years (2015, 2016, etc.) are subsequent and not within the next 12 months. So yes, the correct amount is the 2014 fiscal year's payment.\n</think>\n\nThe portion of future minimum lease payments due in the next 12 months (as of May 31, 2013) corresponds to the fiscal year 2014 payment.

      "ground_truth_answer": "In 2014, the total net revenue was $94,205 million. Net interest income was $43,634 million.\n\nTo calculate the percentage of total net revenue due to net interest income in 2014:\n(Net Interest Income / Total Net Revenue) x 100\n= ($43,634 / $94,205) x 100\n\u2248 46.3%\n\nTherefore, about 46.3% of the total net revenue in 2014 was due to net interest income.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking what percentage of total net revenue was due to net interest income in 2014. Alright, so I need to find the numbers for net interest income and total net revenue for that year from the provided context.\n\nLooking at the data tables, there's a row for \"net interest income\" and \"total net revenue\". For 2014, net interest income is $43,634 million, and total net revenue is $94,205 million. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. The table lists \"net interest income\" as $43,634 million for 2014, and \"total net revenue\" as $94,205 million. So the formula would be (Net Interest Income / Total Net Revenue) * 100 to get the percentage.\n\nCalculating that: 43,634 divided by 94,205. Let me do the division. Let's see, 43,634 \u00f7 94,205 \u2248 0.463. Multiplying by 100 gives approximately 46.3%. \n\nHmm, but wait, let me verify the numbers again. The total net revenue for 2014 is $94,205 million. The net interest income is $43,634 million. Yes, that's correct. So the calculation is accurate. Therefore, the percentage is approximately 46.3%. \n\nI should check if there's any note or adjustment mentioned for these figures. The context mentions some adjustments like FVA and DVA in other parts, but for net interest income and total net revenue, they seem to be straightforward. The answer should be around 46.3%. Let me confirm once more. Yes, 43,634 divided by 94,205 equals roughly 0.463, so 46.3%. That's the percentage.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the percentage of total net revenue attributable to net interest income in 2014, we use the following data from the table:\n\n- **Net Interest Income (2014):** $43,634 million  \n- **Total Net Revenue (2014):** $94,20",

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out the annual interest expense for the series first mortgage bonds due in May 2018. The context mentions that in May 2008, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana issued $375 million of 6.00% series first mortgage bonds. The question is asking for the annual interest expense related to these bonds.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how interest expense is calculated for bonds. Typically, the annual interest expense is the principal amount multiplied by the interest rate. Since these are first mortgage bonds with a fixed rate of 6%, that should be straightforward.\n\nSo the principal is $375 million, and the rate is 6%. Multiplying those together: 375,000,000 * 0.06 = 22,500,000. That would be $22.5 million annually. \n\nBut wait, I should check if there's any other information that might affect this calculation. The context says the proceeds were used to pay off other bonds and for general corporate purposes. However, the interest expense on the new bonds should just depend on their own terms. There's no mention of any discounts or premiums that would require amortization, so it's likely straightforward simple interest. \n\nAlso, the bonds were issued in May 2008, so for the full year 2008, the interest would be prorated. But the question is asking for the annual interest expense related to these bonds, which would be the full 6% of $375 million each year. Even if issued mid-year, the annual expense for accounting purposes would still be based on the full face value and rate. \n\nNo other factors mentioned, like changes in the interest rate or early redemption, since they are due in 2018. Therefore, the answer should be $22.5 million per year.\n</think>\n\nThe annual interest expense for the $375 million 6.00% series first mortgage bonds due May 2018 is calculated by multiplying the principal amount by the stated interest rate:  \n**$375 million \u00d7 6.00% = $22.5 million**.  \n\n**Answer:** 22.5 million.",

There's a table mentioned with data as of December 2014 and December 2013. The rows include various liabilities. The first row is \"compensation and benefits\". For 2014, the value is $8368 million, and for 2013, it's $7874 million. \n\nSo the change would be the 2014 value minus the 2013 value. Let me do that calculation: 8368 minus 7874.

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking what portion of the total net reserves is related to the London Market. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the context provided. There's a table mentioned with environmental reserves as of December 31, 2011. The table has categories like Direct, Assumed Reinsurance, London Market, Total, Ceded, and Net. \n\nLooking at the numbers: The London Market is listed as $57. The total gross is 367, but then there's a ceded amount of -47, leading to a net of $320. The question is about the portion of the net reserves related to London Market.\n\nWait, but the London Market figure in the table is part of the gross. How does that translate to net? The ceded amount is subtracted from the total gross to get the net. But does the London Market's $57 get adjusted by the ceded amount? Or is the ceded amount only for the total?\n\nThe table shows \"ceded\" as -47 (47) under total. So the ceded is applied to the total gross. The London Market's $57 is part of the gross. The net is calculated as total gross minus ceded. But the question is about the portion of the net reserves related to London Market. \n\nWait, the problem is that the table's structure might be that each category (Direct, Assumed, London Market) contributes to the total gross. Then, the ceded is subtracted from the total gross to get the net. So the net is $320. But the London Market's contribution is part of the gross. However, the question is asking what portion of the net is London Market. \n\nBut unless there's more information on how the ceded amount is allocated per category, we can't directly adjust the London Market's gross. The ceded amount is -47 for the total. If the ceded is only related to the total, then the London Market's net would still be $57, but the total net is 320. Therefore, the portion would be 57/320. \n\nBut wait, that might not be accurate because the ceded could be a result of ceding part of the gross reserves. However, the table shows that the total gross is 367, ceded is -4",

The context provided has a table with different components of the \"claims and other bankruptcy settlement obligations\" as of December 31, 2013. The table lists four items: AAG Series A Preferred Stock at $3,329 million, Single-Dip Equity Obligations at $1,246 million, Labor-Related Deemed Claim at $849 million, and the total is $5,424 million.\n\nSo, the total bankruptcy settlement obligations are $5,424 million. The labor-related deemed claim is $849 million. To find the portion, I need to calculate the percentage of the total that the labor-related claim represents. \n\nFirst, I'll take the labor-related amount ($849 million) divided by the total ($5,424 million). Let me do that division. 849 divided by 5424. Let me compute that. \n\nWell, 5424 divided by 100 is 54.24. So 849 divided by 54.24 would give me the percentage. Let me calculate that. 54.24 times 15 is 813.6. That's 15%. The difference between 849 and 813.6 is 35.4. Then, 35.4 divided by 54.24 is approximately 0.653. So total percentage is about 15.65%. \n\nBut maybe I should do it more accurately. Let me use a calculator approach. 849 / 5424. Let's see: 5424 x 0.15 = 813.6. Subtract that from 849: 849 - 813.6 = 35.4. Now, 35.4 / 5424 = 0.00653. So total is 0.15 + 0.00653 = 0.15653, which is 15.653%. So approximately 15.65%. \n\nBut the question might just",
