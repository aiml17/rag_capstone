      "ground_truth_answer": "According to the information provided, the future minimum lease payments for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2014 are $11,057.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking what portion of the future minimum lease payments are due in the next 12 months. The context provided includes a table with future minimum lease payments for non-cancelable operating leases as of May 31, 2013.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which fiscal years fall within the next 12 months from the reporting date. The reporting date here is May 31, 2013. The next 12 months would be from June 1, 2013, to May 31, 2014. So any payments due in the fiscal year ending May 31, 2014, would be within that 12-month period.\n\nLooking at the table, the first entry is for 2014 with $11,057. Since the fiscal year ending May 31, 2014, is within the next 12 months from May 31, 2013, that amount should be the portion due in the next 12 months. The other years (2015 onwards) are beyond that 12-month window. \n\nI need to confirm that the fiscal years are indeed annual and that there's no overlap or different structure. The table lists payments for each fiscal year up to \"thereafter,\" which is for amounts due after 2018. So the 2014 fiscal year payment is the only one within the next 12 months. Therefore, the answer should be $11,057. Also, the total future minimum lease payments are $57,096, but the question is only about the next 12 months, so the answer is just the 2014 amount.\n</think>\n\nThe portion of future minimum lease payments due in the next 12 months corresponds to the fiscal year ending May 31, 2014, which is **$11,057**. This is because the next 12 months from May 31, 2013, covers payments due by May 31, 2014, as outlined in the provided table. \n\n**Answer:** $11,057.",

The user is asking for the percent change in principal transactions revenue related to interest rate risks from 2016 to 2017. \n\nFirst, I need to find the values for those two years. From the context provided, the table shows the numbers. Let me check the table again.\n\nLooking at the table, under \"interest rate risks (1)\", the 2017 value is $5,301 million and the 2016 value is $4,229 million. \n\nThe formula for percent change is ((New Value - Old Value) / Old Value) * 100. So here, New Value is 2017's $5,301 and Old Value is 2016's $4,229.\n\nCalculating the difference: 5301 - 4229 = 1072. Then divide that by 4229. Let me do the division: 1072 / 4229 \u2248 0.2535. Multiply by 100 to get the percentage: 25.35%. \n\nSo the percent change is approximately 25.35%. I should round it to two decimal places, maybe 25.35% or check if the numbers require rounding differently. Let me verify the calculation again. \n\nYes, 4229 + (4229 * 0.2535) \u2248 4229 + 1071.5 \u2248 5300.5, which matches the 2017 value. So that's correct. The answer should be a 25.35% increase.\n</think>\n\nThe percent change in principal transactions revenue associated with interest rate risks from 2016 to 2017 is calculated as follows:  \n\n- **2016 Value**: $4,229 million  \n- **2017 Value**: $5,301 million  \n\n**Formula**:  \n$$\n\\text{Percent Change} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{2017 Value} - \\text{2016 Value}}{\\text{2016 Value}} \\right) \\times 100\n$$\n\n$$",

The table shows \"collateral posted\" as $24,296 million for December 2012 and $29,002 million for December 2011. Wait, actually, the table is labeled with \"as of december 2012\" and \"as of december 2011\". So the 2011 value is 29,002 and 2012 is 24,296. \n\nThe question is about the percentage change from 2011 to 2012. The formula for percentage change is [(New Value - Old Value)/Old Value] * 100. Here, the old value is 2011's collateral, which is 29,002. The new value is 2012's, which is 24,296. \n\nSo subtracting 29,002 minus 24,296 gives a decrease of 4,706. Then divide that by the old value (29,002) and multiply by 100. Let me calculate that. \n\n4,706 divided by 29,002 equals approximately 0.1623. Multiplying by 100 gives about 16.23%. Since the value decreased, the percentage change is a decrease of 16.23%. \n\nWait, let me double-check the numbers. The collateral posted in 2011 is 29,002 and in 2012 it's 24,296. So yes, the difference is 29,002 - 24,296 = 4,706. Dividing 4,706 by 29,002 gives roughly 0.1623, which is 16.23%. So the percentage change is -16.23%, meaning a 16.23% decrease. \n\nI should",

Alright, so first I need to find the numbers for net interest income and total net revenue for 2014 from the provided data.\n\nLooking at the table, under the 2014 column, net interest income is listed as $43,634 million. The total net revenue for 2014 is $94,205 million. Wait, let me double-check that. Yes, the rows are: net interest income is 43,634 and total net revenue is 94,205. \n\nSo the formula for percentage is (part/whole) * 100.

      "question": "what percentage of the outstanding options were from plans approved by security holders?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "To calculate the percentage of outstanding options that were from plans approved by security holders, we first need to add up the total number of outstanding options. \n\nFrom the provided context, we have:\n- Number of securities to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options for plans approved by security holders: 1,211,143\n- Number of securities to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options for plans not approved by security holders: 5,978\n\nTotal outstanding options = 1,211,143 + 5,978 = 1,217,121\n\nNext, we calculate the percentage of outstanding options from plans approved by security holders:\n(1,211,143 / 1,217,121) x 100 = 99.51%\n\nTherefore, approximately 99.51% of the outstanding options were from plans approved by security holders.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking for the percentage of outstanding options that were from plans approved by security holders. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the context provided. There's a table with two categories: equity compensation plans approved by security holders and those not approved. \n\nThe relevant columns here are column (a), which is the number of securities to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options. For the approved plans, it's 1,211,143. For the not approved, it's 5,978. \n\nSo the total outstanding options would be the sum of these two numbers. Let me add them up: 1,211,143 + 5,978. Let me check that again. 1,211,143 plus 5,978 equals... 1,217,121. The total is given in the table as 1,217,121, which matches. \n\nThe question is asking what percentage of these total options are from the approved plans. So the formula would be (approved / total) * 100. \n\nPlugging in the numbers: (1,211,143 / 1,217,121) * 100. Let me calculate that. \n\nFirst, divide 1,211,143 by 1,217,121. Let me do this division. Let me approximate. 1,211,143 divided by 1,217,121. Since both numbers are close, the result should be just under 100%. Let me compute it more precisely. \n\nLet me use a calculator step-by-step. 1,211,143 divided by 1,217,121 equals approximately 0.995. Multiplying by 100 gives 99.5%. \n\nSo the percentage is approximately 99.5%. Let me check if there's any rounding needed. The exact value might be slightly different. Let me compute the exact decimal. \n\n1,211,143 \u00f7 1,217,121. Let me subtract the numerator from the denominator: 1,217,",

      "ground_truth_answer": "To find the average value of settlements for the years 2011-2013, we need to calculate the total value of settlements for each year and then find the average.\n\nSettlements in 2011: $259 million\nSettlements in 2012: $67 million\nSettlements in 2013: $603 million\n\nTotal settlements for the three years = 259 + 67 + 603 = $929 million\n\nAverage value of settlements = Total settlements / Number of years\nAverage value of settlements = $929 million / 3 years\nAverage value of settlements = $309.67 million\n\nTherefore, the average value of settlements for the years 2011-2013 is approximately $309.67 million.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking for the average value of settlements from 2011 to 2013 based on the provided context. First, I need to locate the settlements data for each of those years in the given table.\n\nLooking at the table, there's a row labeled \"settlements\" with values for 2013, 2012, and 2011. The numbers are listed as \"-603 (603)\", \"-67 (67)\", and \"-259 (259)\" respectively. Wait, the formatting here is a bit confusing. The numbers are written with a negative sign and then in parentheses. But in the context of accounting, sometimes parentheses indicate negative numbers. However, the first number is written as \"-603 (603)\", which might be redundant. Let me check the original context again.\n\nIn the table, under the settlements row, the entries are \"-603 (603)\", \"-67 (67)\", and \"-259 (259)\". The note mentions that reductions are in parentheses. Wait, the footnotes say that the amounts in parentheses are the reductions for tax positions of prior years, but the settlements row is separate. However, the settlements are listed as negative numbers. But in accounting terms, settlements could be either positive or negative depending on whether they add to or reduce the balance. \n\nWait, the settlements row is part of the reconciliation. The settlements are reductions, so they are subtracted. The values given are negative numbers, which in accounting terms might represent a decrease. For example, if the balance is increasing with additions and decreasing with settlements, then settlements would be subtracted. The numbers here are -603, -67, -259 for 2013, 2012, 2011 respectively. Wait, but the way they are written is \"-603 (603)\", which might be a formatting issue where the negative number is shown as -603 and also in parentheses (603). So the actual value for settlements in each year is the first number: -603 for 2013, -67 for 2012, and -259 for 2011. \n\nBut the question is about the average value of settlements.",
