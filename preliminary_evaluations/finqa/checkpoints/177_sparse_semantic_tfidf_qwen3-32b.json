      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking for the value of rent expense and certain office equipment expense under lease agreements between 2013 and 2015. The context provided has some information about that.\n\nLooking at the context, there's a paragraph that says: \"rent expense and certain office equipment expense under lease agreements amounted to $136 million, $132 million and $137 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\" Wait, the order here is 2015, 2014, 2013. Let me parse that again. The numbers are 136, 132, 137 for 2015, 2014, 2013. So the years are listed as 2015, 2014, 2013. But the question is asking for the total between 2013 and 2015. So that would be 2013, 2014, 2015. Let me check the exact numbers.\n\nThe sentence says: \"amounted to $136 million, $132 million and $137 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\" So breaking it down:\n\n- 2013: $137 million\n- 2014: $132 million\n- 2015: $136 million\n\nSo the total would be 137 + 132 + 136. Let me add those up. 137 + 132 is 269, and 269 + 136 is 405. So the total rent expense and office equipment expense from 2013 to 2015 is $405 million. The answer should be 405 million dollars. Let me make sure there's no other numbers in the context that might be relevant. The rest of the context talks about lease commitments, contingent payments, etc., but the specific rent expenses for those years are given here. So yes, the answer is 405.\n</think>\n\nThe value of rent expense and",

The context provided has a list of future minimum lease payments for non-cancelable operating leases as of May 31, 2013.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which of the listed fiscal years fall within the next 12 months from the current date. But wait, when is the current date? The question doesn't specify, but the context mentions May 31, 2013, as the date of the lease payments. So if we're considering the next 12 months from when the question is being asked, but the context is as of May 31, 2013. However, the question might be asking as of that date. Let me think.\n\nThe next 12 months from May 31, 2013, would be up to May 31, 2014. Looking at the fiscal years listed: 2014, 2015, etc. The first fiscal year listed is 2014, which is the first year after May 31, 2013. The amount for 2014 is $11,057. Then 2015 is $8,985, and so on. Since the next 12 months would cover the fiscal year ending May 31, 2014, which is the 2014 amount. So the portion due in the next 12 months is $11,057. \n\nWait, but the question is phrased as \"the next 12 months\" from when? If the current date is when the question is being asked, but the context is as of May 31, 2013. Let me check again. The context is from May 31, 2013, so the next 12 months from that date would be up to May 31, 2014. Therefore, the amount due in that period is the 2014 fiscal year amount, which is $11,057. The other amounts are for subsequent years beyond the next 12 months. So the answer should be $11,057",

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking for the percent change in principal transactions revenue associated with interest rate risks from 2016 to 2017. \n\nFirst, I need to find the values for interest rate risks in those two years. Looking at the table provided, the row labeled \"interest rate risks (1)\" has the numbers. For 2017, it's $5301 million, and for 2016, it's $4229 million.\n\nThe formula for percent change is ((New Value - Old Value) / Old Value) * 100. So here, the new value is 2017's figure, and the old value is 2016's. \n\nLet me calculate the difference first: 5301 minus 4229. Let me do that subtraction. 5301 - 4229. Let's see, 5300 - 4200 is 1100, then subtract 29 and add 1 back? Wait, maybe better to do it step by step. 5301 - 4229. 4229 + 1000 is 5229. Then 5301 - 5229 is 72. So total difference is 1072? Wait, no. Wait, 4229 + 1072 = 5301? Let me check: 4229 + 1000 is 5229, plus 72 is 5301. Yes, correct. So the difference is $1072 million.\n\nNow divide that by the old value (2016's 4229). So 1072 / 4229. Let me compute that. Let me approximate. 4229 * 0.25 is 1057.25. Oh, that's very close to 1072.

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out the annual interest expense for the 6.00% Series First Mortgage Bonds due May 2018. \n\nFirst, the context says that Entergy Gulf States Louisiana issued $375 million of these bonds. The interest rate is 6.00%. So, to find the annual interest expense, I think I just need to multiply the principal amount by the interest rate.\n\nSo, $375 million times 6% would be... let me calculate that. 375,000,000 * 0.06 equals 22,500,000.

The context mentions that the proceeds were used to pay off other bonds, but the question is specifically about the interest expense related to the May 2018 bonds. Since the interest rate is fixed at 6%, and the principal is $375 million, the annual interest should just be straightforward. \n\nI don't see any mention of discounts, premiums, or other factors that would amortize or change the effective interest rate. So, I think the answer is $22.5 million.\n</think>\n\nThe annual interest expense for the 6.00% Series First Mortgage Bonds due May 2018 is calculated by multiplying the principal amount ($375 million) by the stated interest rate (6.00%). \n\n**Calculation:**  \n$375,000,000 \u00d7 6.00% = $22,500,000.\n\n**Answer:** 22.5 million.",

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking for the percentage increase in the average price of WTI crude oil from 2011 to 2013. The context provided includes a table with the prices for WTI crude oil in those years.\n\nFirst, I need to locate the correct numbers. The table shows WTI crude oil prices as $98.05 in 2013 and $95.11 in 2011. Wait, let me check again. The table has the years 2013, 2012, 2011. The rows are for different benchmarks. The WTI row has 2013 as $98.05, 2012 as $94.15, and 2011 as $95.11. So from 2011 to 2013, the price went from $95.11 to $98.05.\n\nTo calculate the percentage increase, the formula is ((New Value - Old Value)/Old Value) * 100. So that would be ((98.05 - 95.11)/95.11) * 100. Let me compute that. The difference is 98.05 - 95.11 = 2.94. Then divide by 95.11: 2.94 / 95.11 \u2248 0.0309. Multiply by 100 gives approximately 3.09%. So the percentage increase is about 3.09%. I should round it to two decimal places, maybe 3.09% or check if the numbers are exact. The answer should be approximately 3.1% or 3.09% depending on rounding conventions.\n</think>\n\nThe average price of WTI crude oil increased from $95.11 in 2011 to $98.05 in 2013.

The question is asking for the change in compensation and benefits liability between 2014 and 2013, in millions.\n\nLooking at the context provided, there's a table with different line items. The first row is labeled \"compensation and benefits\" with values \"$ 8368\" for December 2014 and \"$ 7874\" for December 2013. \n\nSo, to find the change, I need to subtract the 2013 value from the 2014 value. That would be 8368 minus 7874. Let me do that calculation. \n\n8368 minus 7874 equals... let's see, 8368 - 7874. Subtracting step by step: 7874 + 494 = 8368. So the difference is 494 million. \n\nWait, the question is about the change in liability. Since compensation and benefits is an expense, but here it's listed as a liability? Hmm, maybe the numbers here are the liabilities related to compensation and benefits. The answer should just be the numerical difference between the two years. \n\nSo the answer should be $8368 million in 2014 minus $7874 million in 2013, which is $494 million increase. Therefore, the change is 494 million. \n\nI don't see any other information in the context that affects this particular line item.

Then under direct, it's $271, assumed reinsurance is 39, London market is 57, total is 367, ceded is -47 (47), and net is $320. \n\nWait, so the total gross reserves are broken down into direct, assumed reinsurance, and London market.

But the London Market figure in the gross is 57. However, the net reserves are 320. But how does the London Market part factor into the net? \n\nWait, the ceded amount is -47. Ceded reserves are the amount that the company has reinsured, so they subtract that from the gross to get net. But does the London Market portion have any ceded? The context mentions that the company classifies its gross exposure into direct, assumed reinsurance, and London market. The ceded amount is listed as -47 (47), which might be a typo but probably means that the total ceded is 47. \n\nBut the problem is, does the ceded amount apply to all categories or just some? The context doesn't specify whether the ceded is only from direct or also from assumed or London market. However, in typical accounting practices, ceded reinsurance would apply to the total gross reserves. But since the London market is part of the gross, perhaps the ceded amount is part of that. However, without more info, maybe we need to assume that the London market's net is its gross minus a portion of the ceded.
