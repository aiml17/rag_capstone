      "question": "what is the value of rent expense and certain office equipment expense under lease agreements , between 2013 and 2015 ? in million $ .",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Between 2013 and 2015, the value of rent expense and certain office equipment expense under lease agreements amounted to $ 137 million in 2013, $ 132 million in 2014, and $ 136 million in 2015.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking for the value of rent expense and office equipment expense under lease agreements between 2013 and 2015. The context provided has some numbers here.\n\nLooking through the text, there's a section that says: \"Rent expense and certain office equipment expense under lease agreements amounted to $136 million, $132 million and $137 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\" Wait, the order here is 2015, 2014, 2013. Let me parse that correctly. The numbers are given in the order of 2015, 2014, 2013. So 2015 is $136 million, 2014 is $132 million, and 2013 is $137 million. \n\nThe question is asking for the total between 2013 and 2015. So adding those three years together: 137 (2013) + 132 (2014) + 136 (2015). Let me do the math. 137 + 132 is 269, and then adding 136 gives 269 + 136 = 405. So the total rent expense from 2013 to 2015 would be $405 million. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other numbers mentioned for those years. The context also has another part about future minimum commitments under operating leases, but that's about future payments, not the actual expenses incurred in 2013-2015. The rent expenses for those years are clearly stated in the paragraph. So the answer should be 137 + 132 + 136 = 405 million dollars. Let me check again the order to avoid mixing up the years. The text says \"2015, 2014 and 2013 respectively\" with the amounts \"$136 million, $132 million and $137 million\". So 2015: 136, 2014:",

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking for the percent change in principal transactions revenue related to interest rate risks from 2016 to 2017. First, I need to find the values for those two years. \n\nLooking at the table provided, the row for \"interest rate risks (1)\" shows the 2017 value as $5,301 million and 2016 as $4,229 million. The question is about the change from 2016 to 2017, so those are the numbers I need.\n\nTo calculate the percent change, the formula is ((New Value - Old Value) / Old Value) * 100. So plugging in the numbers: (5301 - 4229) / 4229 * 100. Let me do the subtraction first: 5301 minus 4229 equals 1,072. Then divide that by 4,229. \n\nLet me compute that division. 1072 divided by 4229. Let me approximate. 4229 times 0.25 is 1057.25. So 1072 is a bit more than that. The difference between 1072 and 1057.25 is 14.75. So 0.25 + (14.75 / 4229). 14.75 divided by 4229 is approximately 0.0035. So total is roughly 0.2535, which is 25.35%. \n\nWait, let me check with exact calculation. 1072 / 4229. Let me use a calculator step. 4229 * 0.25 = 1057.25. 1072 - 1057.25 = 14.75. So 14.75 / 4229 \u2248 0.00349. So total is 0.25 + 0.00349 \u2248 0.25349, which is 25.35%.",

From the data given, in 2012 (December 2012) the collateral posted is $24,296 million, and in 2011 (December 2011) it's $29,002 million. \n\nWait, let me double-check that.

So yes, collateral posted for 2012 is 24,296 and for 2011 is 29,002.\n\nThe formula for percentage change is [(New Value - Old Value)/Old Value] * 100. Here, the new value is 2012's collateral, and the old value is 2011's. So the calculation would be (24296 - 29002)/29002 * 100. \n\nLet me compute that. Subtracting 29,002 by 24,296 gives a difference of -4,706. Dividing that by 29,002 gives approximately -0.1623. Multiplying by 100 gives -16.23%. So the percentage change is a decrease of about 16.23%. \n\nWait, but the user might want the absolute value? No, percentage change can be negative if it's a decrease. The answer should be -16.23%, but maybe they want it as a positive number with a note that it's a decrease. However, the question just asks for the percentage change, so the negative sign indicates a decrease. \n\nLet me verify the numbers again",

But looking at the provided context, I need to check if there's any mention of net interest income or the total net revenue figures.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the context. The context talks about various revenue components like equity underwriting fees, debt underwriting fees, investment banking fees, principal transactions revenue, asset management fees, securities gains, card income, and lending and deposit-related fees. However, I don't see any explicit mention of \"net interest income.\" \n\nThe sections mention different segments like CIB (Corporate and Investment Bank), CB (Consumer Bank), CCB (Corporate and Commercial Bank), and AM (Asset Management). Each of these segments has their own revenue components. For example, there's a part about card income including net interchange income, but that's part of the CCB segment results. \n\nThe user is specifically asking about net interest income. In banking, net interest income typically refers to the difference between interest earned on assets and interest paid on liabilities. However, the context provided doesn't seem to break down the revenue in that way. Instead, it categorizes revenue into underwriting fees, principal transactions, asset management, etc. \n\nSince there's no mention of net interest income in the context, I can't calculate the percentage based on the given information. The answer would require data that isn't present here. The user might be referring to a different part of the document that isn't included in the provided context. The context does reference various pages (like pages 81\u201391 for CCB, 92\u201396 for CIB, etc.), but without access to those specific pages or the actual numbers from those sections, I can't determine the exact percentage. \n\nTherefore, the correct response is to state that the information isn't available in the provided context. The user might need to refer to the specific pages mentioned or another section of the document where net interest income is detailed.\n</think>\n\nThe provided context does not include specific figures for net interest income or total net revenue for 2014. While the text discusses various revenue components (e.g., underwriting fees, principal transactions, asset management fees, card income), it does not explicitly mention **net interest income** or provide the necessary numerical data to calculate its percentage of total net revenue.

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out the annual interest expense related to the Series First Mortgage Bonds due May 2018. The context mentions that in May 2008, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana issued $375 million of 6.00% Series First Mortgage Bonds due May 2018. The question is asking for the annual interest expense on these bonds.\n\nFirst, I know that interest expense for bonds is typically calculated by multiplying the principal amount by the interest rate. The principal here is $375 million, and the rate is 6.00%. So, 375 million times 6% should give the annual interest. Let me do that calculation: 375 * 0.06 = 22.5. So that would be $22.5 million per year.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure there's no other information that might affect this calculation. The context also mentions that the proceeds from these bonds were used to pay off other bonds, but since the question is specifically about the May 2018 bonds, those other transactions probably don't affect the interest expense calculation for the 2018 bonds. Also, the context states that there are no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility as of December 31, 2008, but that's about a different financing arrangement.\n\nAnother thing to check is whether the 6% is the correct rate and if there are any other factors like discounts or premiums that might affect the interest expense. However, the context doesn't mention any discounts or premiums related to the issuance of these bonds. It just states the 6% rate, so I can assume it's a straightforward calculation.\n\nTherefore, the annual interest expense should be $22.5 million. The answer should be 22.5 million dollars.\n</think>\n\nThe annual interest expense related to the Series First Mortgage Bonds due May 2018 is calculated by multiplying the principal amount ($375 million) by the stated interest rate (6.00%). \n\n**Calculation:**  \n$375 million \u00d7 6.00% = $22.5 million.\n\n**Answer:** 22.5 million.",

I need to look at the context provided to find the relevant numbers.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the context for mentions of WTI prices. There's a table listed with benchmark prices for different years. The table has rows for WTI crude oil, Brent crude oil, and Henry Hub natural gas. The years given are 2013, 2012, and 2011. \n\nLooking at the WTI row: the prices are $98.05 in 2013, $94.15 in 2012, and $95.11 in 2011. The question is about the increase from 2011 to 2013. So the starting value is 2011's $95.11 and the ending value is 2013's $98.05.\n\nTo calculate the percentage increase, the formula is ((New Value - Old Value) / Old Value) * 100. Plugging in the numbers: ((98.05 - 95.11) / 95.11) * 100. Let me do the subtraction first: 98.05 minus 95.11 equals 2.94. Then divide that by 95.11. Let me calculate that: 2.94 / 95.11 \u2248 0.0309. Multiply by 100 gives approximately 3.09%. \n\nSo the percentage increase is roughly 3.09%. The answer should be rounded appropriately. The question doesn't specify decimal places, but since the original numbers are in two decimal places, maybe one decimal place would be sufficient. So approximately 3.1%.\n\nWait, let me double-check the numbers. The 2011 price is $95.11 and 2013 is $98.05. Yes, the difference is indeed $2.94. Divided by the original 2011 price. The calculation seems right. So the percentage increase is about 3.1%. That's the answer",

      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the information provided in the context, the portion of the total net reserves that is related to the London market is $57 million.\n\nThe summary of environmental reserves shows that the \"London market\" category has gross reserves of $57 million.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking what portion of the total net reserves is related to the London Market. Let me look at the context provided.\n\nFirst, there's a table mentioned. The table has rows for direct, assumed reinsurance, London market, total, ceded, and net. The numbers are in dollars. The London market row shows $57. The total gross is $367, and after ceding $47, the net is $320. \n\nWait, the question is about the portion of the total net reserves related to London Market. So the total net reserves are $320. But the London Market's gross is $57. However, I need to check if the London Market amount is already netted against ceded. But looking at the table structure, the \"ceded\" line is subtracted from the total gross. The London Market line is part of the gross before ceding. So the gross for London is $57. But the ceded is -$47 in total. Wait, the ceded line is -47 (47), which probably means that the total ceded is $47. But how much of that ceded amount relates to London Market? The table doesn't specify. The original breakdown is into direct, assumed reinsurance, and London market. Then total gross is 367, ceded is -47, so net is 320. \n\nAssuming that the ceded amount applies to all categories, but the problem is that the table doesn't specify how much of the ceded relates to London Market. However, the question is about the portion of the total net reserves. If the London Market's gross is $57, and the total gross is $367, then perhaps the net for London Market would be its gross minus a portion of the ceded. But since the ceded is not broken down by category, maybe the question expects us to take the London Market's gross as part of the total gross and then calculate its proportion of the net reserves based on that. Alternatively, maybe the ceded amount is only related to other categories, not London Market. But that's unclear.\n\nWait, the table shows \"ceded\" as -47 (47), which might mean that the total ceded is $47 million. The total net is 367 - 4",
