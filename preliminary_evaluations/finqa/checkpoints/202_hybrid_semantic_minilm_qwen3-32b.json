The context provided has some financial data.\n\nLooking at the context, there's a paragraph that says: \"rent expense and certain office equipment expense under lease agreements amounted to $136 million, $132 million and $137 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\" \n\nWait, the order here is 2015, 2014, 2013. Let me parse that again. The numbers are given as $136 million for 2015, $132 million for 2014, and $137 million for 2013. The question is asking for the total between 2013 and 2015. So that would be adding up the three years: 2013 ($137M) + 2014 ($132M) + 2015 ($136M). \n\nLet me check if I got the years right. The sentence says \"in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\" The order is 2015 first, then 2014, then 2013. So the numbers correspond to each year in that order. Wait, no, the way it's written is \"amounted to $136 million, $132 million and $137 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\" The word \"respectively\" means that each number corresponds to the years listed in order. So first number $136M is for 2015, second $132M for 2014, third $137M for 2013. \n\nSo adding them up: 137 (2013) + 132 (2014) + 136 (2015).

The context provided includes a list of future minimum lease payments for non-cancelable operating leases as of May 31, 2013.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which of the listed fiscal years fall within the next 12 months from the current date. But wait, the context is from May 31, 2013. The next 12 months from that date would be up to May 31, 2014. However, the fiscal years listed are ending on May 31 each year. The first entry is for 2014, which is the fiscal year ending May 31, 2014. Since the current date is May 31, 2013, the next fiscal year (2014) would be the first 12 months. So the amount due in the next 12 months is the payment for 2014, which is $11,057. \n\nWait, but sometimes \"next 12 months\" can be interpreted as the upcoming calendar year. However, since the company uses fiscal years ending May 31, the next fiscal year (2014) is exactly 12 months from May 31, 2013. Therefore, the correct amount should be the 2014 payment. The other payments are for subsequent years beyond the next 12 months. The \"thereafter\" category includes amounts beyond 2018, but those are more than 5 years out. So the answer should be $11,057. Let me double-check the context to make sure there's no other info that might affect this. The other parts of the context talk about lawsuits, loans, and Visa processes, which don't seem relevant to the lease payments. So yes, the next 12 months would be the 2014 fiscal year's payment.\n</think>\n\nThe portion of future minimum lease payments due in the next 12 months corresponds to the fiscal year ending May 31, 2014, which is **$11,057**.

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking for the percent change in principal transactions revenue related to interest rate risks from 2016 to 2017. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the context provided. The table has rows for different risk categories. The first row under \"interest rate risks (1)\" shows the values for 2018, 2017, and 2016 as $5186 million, $5301 million, and $4229 million respectively.\n\nThe question is about the change from 2016 to 2017. So the numbers we need are 2017's value ($5301 million) and 2016's value ($4229 million). \n\nTo calculate the percent change, the formula is ((New Value - Old Value)/Old Value) * 100. Here, the new value is 2017's figure, and the old value is 2016's. \n\nSo subtracting 4229 from 5301 gives 1072. Then divide that by 4229. Let me do the division: 1072 / 4229 \u2248 0.2535. Multiplying by 100 gives approximately 25.35%. \n\nI should check if the numbers are in the correct units.

The footnotes explain what's included, but since we're using the direct numbers from the table, we don't need to adjust them. \n\nSo the percent change is approximately 25.35%.

Wait, actually, the table's columns are labeled \"as of December 2012\" and \"as of December 2011\". So the first number under 2012 is 24,296 and the 2011 value is 29,002. \n\nTo calculate the percentage change, the formula is ((New Value - Old Value)/Old Value) * 100. Here, the new value is 2012's collateral, and the old value is 2011's. So subtracting 29,002 from 24,296 gives a difference of -4,706. Then divide that by 29,002. Let me do the math: -4,706 divided by 29,002 equals approximately -0.1623. Multiplying by 100 gives -16.23%. \n\nSo the percentage change is a decrease of about 16.23%.

The question is asking what percentage of the total net revenue in 2014 was due to net interest income. \n\nFirst, I need to find the numbers for net interest income and total net revenue for 2014 from the provided context. Looking at the table, there's a row labeled \"net interest income\" which is $43,634 million. The total net revenue for 2014 is listed as $94,205 million.\n\nSo the formula to calculate the percentage would be (Net Interest Income / Total Net Revenue) * 100.

Multiply by 100 gives 46.32%. So rounding to two decimal places, that's 46.32%. But maybe the answer expects one decimal place or a whole number.

      "question": "what is the annual interest expense related to series first mortgage bonds due may 2018 , in millions?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the information provided, in May 2008, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana issued $375 million of 6.00% series first mortgage bonds due May 2018.\n\nTo calculate the annual interest expense related to these bonds, we can multiply the principal amount by the interest rate:\n\n$375 million x 0.06 = $22.5 million\n\nTherefore, the annual interest expense related to the series first mortgage bonds due May 2018 is $22.5 million.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out the annual interest expense for the 6.00% Series First Mortgage Bonds due May 2018. The context mentions that Entergy Gulf States Louisiana issued $375 million of these bonds in May 2008. The interest rate is 6.00%, so I need to calculate the annual interest expense based on that.\n\nFirst, the formula for annual interest expense on a bond is principal multiplied by the interest rate. So, $375 million times 6%. Let me do that calculation. 375,000,000 * 0.06 equals 22,500,000. That would be $22.5 million per year in interest expenses.\n\nWait, but I should check if there's any other information that might affect this. The context mentions that the proceeds were used to pay off other bonds, but the question is specifically about the interest expense related to the 6% bonds issued in 2008. Since the bonds were issued in May 2008, the first full year of interest would be from May 2008 to May 2009, but the question is asking for the annual interest expense, which is typically based on the face value and the stated rate. So even if the bonds were issued mid-year, the annual expense would still be calculated as 6% of $375 million, which is $22.5 million. \n\nI don't see any mention of amortization or other factors that would change the interest expense from the straightforward calculation. The other bonds mentioned (the 3.6% and floating rate ones) have been paid off by Entergy Texas, so they don't affect the current calculation. The answer should be $22.5 million.\n</think>\n\nThe annual interest expense for the 6.00% Series First Mortgage Bonds due May 2018 is calculated by multiplying the principal amount ($375 million) by the interest rate (6.00%). \n\n**Calculation:**  \n$375,000,000 \u00d7 6.00% = $22,500,000.\n\nThus, the annual interest expense is **$22.5 million**.  \n\n**Answer:** 22.5",

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking for the percentage increase in the average price of WTI crude oil from 2011 to 2013. First, I need to find the average prices for those years from the provided table.\n\nLooking at the context, there's a table with years 2011, 2012, 2013. The WTI crude oil prices are listed as $95.11 in 2011, $94.15 in 2012, and $98.05 in 2013. Wait, the user is asking from 2011 to 2013, so I need the values for those two years specifically.\n\nSo, the formula for percentage increase is [(New Value - Original Value) / Original Value] * 100. Here, the original value is 2011's price, which is $95.11, and the new value is 2013's price, $98.05. \n\nCalculating the difference: 98.05 - 95.11 = 2.94. Then divide that by the original value: 2.94 / 95.11. Let me compute that. Let me do the division: 2.94 divided by 95.11. Hmm, 95.11 goes into 2.94 about 0.0309 times. Multiplying by 100 gives approximately 3.09%. \n\nWait, let me check the calculation again. Maybe I should use more precise numbers. Let me do it step by step. \n\nFirst, subtract 95.11 from 98.05: 98.05 minus 95.11 equals 2.94. Then divide 2.94 by 95.11. Let me calculate that. 95.11 times 0.03 is 2.8533. The difference between 2.94 and 2.8533 is 0.0867. So, 0.03 plus (0.0867 / 95.11). 0.0",

The question is asking for the change in compensation and benefits liability between 2014 and 2013, in millions.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the context provided.

The numbers are given as \"$ 8368\" for 2014 and \"$ 7874\" for 2013. \n\nSo, the change would be the 2014 value minus the 2013 value. Let me calculate that. 8368 minus 7874. Let me do the subtraction step by step. 8000 minus 7000 is 1000. Then 368 minus 874. Wait, maybe breaking it down differently: 7874 + 494 = 8368? Let me check. 7874 + 400 is 8274. Then adding 94 more would be 8368. Yes, that's right. So the difference is 494 million. \n\nBut wait, the question is about the change in liability. So if compensation and benefits increased from 2013 to 2014, the change would be positive 494 million. The answer should be presented as $494 million. But the question says \"in millions,\" so maybe just 494. Let me confirm the numbers again. The 2014 value is $8,368 million and 2013 is $7,874 million. Subtracting 7,874 from 8,368 gives exactly 494. So the answer is 494 million. \n\nI don't see any other information in the context that would affect this calculation.

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking what portion of the total net reserves is related to the London Market. Let me look at the context provided.\n\nFirst, there's a table with different categories. The total reserves section shows \"gross\" with subcategories: direct, assumed reinsurance, London market, and total. Then there's ceded and net. \n\nLooking at the numbers: under gross, direct is $271, assumed reinsurance is $39, London market is $57, so total gross is 271 + 39 + 57 = 367. Then ceded is -47, so net is 367 - 47 = $320. \n\nThe question is about the portion related to London Market in the net reserves. Wait, the net reserves are $320. But the London Market is part of the gross. However, does the ceded amount affect London Market specifically? The table shows that London Market is part of the gross, and then ceded is a separate line item. The ceded amount is -47, which is subtracted from the total gross to get net. But the question is about the portion of net reserves related to London Market. \n\nSo, the London Market's gross is $57. But when calculating net reserves, do we subtract the ceded amount from each category or just from the total? The table shows that the ceded is a total figure.

But the question is, how much of that $320 is from London Market?\n\nBut the problem is that the ceded amount isn't broken down by category. The table doesn't specify how much of the ceded $47 is related to each of the gross components (direct, assumed, London). Therefore, we can't directly calculate the net for London Market. However, the question might be expecting us to take the London Market's gross portion and assume that the ceded is applied proportionally or that the net is just the gross minus some portion.
