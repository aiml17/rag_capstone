Let me parse that again. The numbers are given as $136 million for 2015, $132 million for 2014, and $137 million for 2013. The question is asking for the total between 2013 and 2015. So I need to add the three years together. \n\nSo 2013 is 137, 2014 is 132, and 2015 is 136. Adding those up: 137 + 132 is 269, plus 136 makes 405. So the total would be $405 million. Let me double-check the numbers to make sure I didn't mix up the years. The text says \"in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\" So the first number is 2015, then 2014, then 2013. So yes, 136 (2015) + 132 (2014) + 137 (2013) equals 405. \n\nI don't see any other numbers related to rent expense in the context for those years.

But wait, when is the current date? The context mentions May 31, 2013, as the date when the future payments are reported. The question is being asked now, but the data is as of May 31, 2013. So if we're considering the next 12 months from the time of the report, which is May 31, 2013, then the next 12 months would be from June 1, 2013, to May 31, 2014. \n\nLooking at the fiscal years listed: 2014, 2015, etc. The fiscal year ending May 31, 2014, would be the first year in that 12-month window. The payment for 2014 is $11,057. The next year, 2015, starts after May 31, 2014, so it's outside the next 12 months.

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking for the percent change in principal transactions revenue related to interest rate risks from 2016 to 2017. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the context provided. The table has rows for different risk categories. The first row under \"interest rate risks (1)\" shows the values for 2018, 2017, and 2016 as $5186 million, $5301 million, and $4229 million respectively.\n\nThe question is about the change from 2016 to 2017. So the numbers we need are 2017's value ($5301 million) and 2016's value ($4229 million). \n\nTo calculate the percent change, the formula is ((New Value - Old Value)/Old Value) * 100. Here, the new value is 2017's figure, and the old value is 2016's. \n\nSo plugging in the numbers: (5301 - 4229)/4229 * 100. Let me do the subtraction first: 5301 minus 4229 equals 1072. Then divide that by 4229. Let me calculate 1072 divided by 4229. \n\nHmm, 4229 times 0.25 is 1057.25. That's close to 1072. So maybe around 25.3%? Let me check with exact division. 1072 / 4229 \u2248 0.2535. Multiply by 100 gives 25.35%. \n\nSo the percent change is approximately 25.35%. The user might want it rounded to one decimal place, so 25.4%. \n\nI should make sure there's no mistake in selecting the correct rows. The note (1) mentions government securities and corporate debt, etc., which aligns with interest rate risks.

The numbers are 24296 and 29002, respectively. Wait, the units are in millions, but since we're calculating percentage change, the units will cancel out, so I don't need to worry about converting them. \n\nThe formula for percentage change is [(New Value - Old Value) / Old Value] * 100. Here, the new value is 2012's collateral posted (24,296 million) and the old value is 2011's (29,002 million). \n\nSubtracting 29,002 from 24,296 gives a difference of -4,706. Dividing that by 29,002 gives approximately -0.1623. Multiplying by 100 gives about -16.23%. So the percentage change is a decrease of 16.23%. \n\nWait, let me double-check the numbers. The 2012 value is lower than 2011, so it's a decrease. The calculation seems right. Maybe I should verify the subtraction again. 29,002 minus 24,296 is 4,706. Since it's new minus old, it's 24,296 - 29,002 = -4,706. Yes, that's correct. Divided by 29,002 gives the same result. So the answer should be approximately -16.23%, or a 16.23% decrease. The negative sign indicates a decrease. The user might want the absolute value, but percentage change usually includes the sign. Let me confirm the exact numbers again.

Let me look at the table again.\n\nLooking at the rows, there's a row for \"net interest income\" and another for \"noninterest revenue\".

Let me confirm if total net revenue is indeed the sum of net interest income and noninterest revenue. The last row says \"total net revenue\" as $94,205, which should be the sum of the two components. Let me add the numbers: 43,634 (net interest) + 50,571 (noninterest) equals 94,205. That matches the total given, so that's correct.\n\nSo, the question is to find what percentage net interest income is of the total net revenue. The formula for percentage is (part / whole) * 100.

      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the information provided, in May 2008, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana issued $375 million of 6.00% series first mortgage bonds due May 2018.\n\nTo calculate the annual interest expense related to these bonds, we can multiply the principal amount by the interest rate:\n\n$375 million x 0.06 = $22.5 million\n\nTherefore, the annual interest expense related to the series first mortgage bonds due May 2018 is $22.5 million.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking for the annual interest expense related to the Series First Mortgage Bonds due May 2018. The context mentions that Entergy Gulf States Louisiana issued $375 million of 6.00% series first mortgage bonds in May 2008, due in May 2018. \n\nSo, the interest rate is 6.00%, and the principal is $375 million. To find the annual interest expense, I think it's just the principal multiplied by the interest rate. Let me check if there's any other information that might affect this calculation.\n\nLooking through the context again, the main details about these bonds are the amount ($375 million) and the rate (6.00%). The other parts talk about how the proceeds were used to pay off other bonds, but that shouldn't affect the interest expense calculation for the 2018 bonds. The other bonds mentioned (like the 3.6% series and the floating rate series) are different and have different terms, so they're probably not relevant here.\n\nSo, the formula would be: Interest Expense = Principal \u00d7 Rate. Plugging in the numbers: 375 million \u00d7 6% = 22.5 million. Therefore, the annual interest expense should be $22.5 million. I don't see any mention of discounts, premiums, or other factors that would require amortization, so it's straightforward. The answer should be 22.5 million.\n</think>\n\nThe annual interest expense for the $375 million 6.00% Series First Mortgage Bonds due May 2018 is calculated by multiplying the principal amount by the interest rate:  \n$375 million \u00d7 6.00% = **$22.5 million**.  \n\n**Answer:** 22.5 million.",

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking by what percentage the average price of WTI crude oil increased from 2011 to 2013. I need to figure this out based on the provided context.\n\nFirst, I should look at the data given in the context. There's a table with the WTI crude oil prices for 2011, 2012, and 2013. The values are in dollars per barrel. Let me check the numbers again. \n\nFrom the table:\n- In 2011, WTI was $95.11 per barrel.\n- In 2013, it was $98.05 per barrel.\n\nThe question is about the percentage increase from 2011 to 2013. So, I need to calculate the percentage change between these two years. \n\nThe formula for percentage increase is: ((New Value - Old Value) / Old Value) * 100. \n\nPlugging in the numbers: (98.05 - 95.11) / 95.11 * 100. Let me compute that step by step. \n\nFirst, subtract the old value from the new: 98.05 - 95.11 = 2.94. \n\nThen divide by the old value: 2.94 / 95.11 \u2248 0.0309. \n\nMultiply by 100 to get the percentage: 0.0309 * 100 \u2248 3.09%. \n\nSo the average price increased by approximately 3.09%. \n\nWait, let me double-check the numbers. The 2011 value is $95.11 and 2013 is $98.05. Yes, that's correct. The calculation seems right. \n\nI should also make sure that there's no other data in the context that might affect this. The context mentions the percentage of light sweet crude increasing, but that's about production mix, not the price of WTI itself. The other numbers like Brent or Henry Hub natural gas aren't relevant here. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be approximately a 3.09% increase. Depending on rounding, maybe they expect it to be 3.",

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking what portion of the total net reserves is related to the London Market. Let me look at the context provided.\n\nFirst, there's a table with different categories. The first row has \"total reserves\", but then there's a breakdown under \"gross [1] [2]\". The rows under that are \"direct\" with $271, \"assumed reinsurance\" with $39, \"London market\" with $57, and then \"total\" with $367. Then there's \"ceded\" with -47 (which is in parentheses, maybe indicating a negative value?), leading to \"net\" being $320.\n\nSo the total gross is 271 + 39 + 57 = 367. Then ceded is subtracted (47), so net is 367 - 47 = 320. That matches the numbers given. The question is about the portion related to London Market. The London Market's gross amount is $57. But we need to find out how much of the net reserves is from London Market.\n\nWait, but does the ceded amount affect the London Market portion? The ceded is a total cession from the total gross. So the net reserves are total gross minus ceded. But the London Market is part of the gross. So to find the net related to London Market, is it just the same proportion as in the gross? Or is the ceded amount not affecting the London Market specifically?\n\nThe ceded amount is a total cession (-47) from the entire gross. So the net is total gross (367) minus ceded (47) equals 320. But the question is about the portion of net reserves related to London Market. Since the ceded is applied to the total, not specifically to each component (direct, assumed, London), I think the London Market's contribution to the net would be its proportion of the gross, multiplied by the net. Wait, but maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the net for each component is calculated individually. But the context doesn't specify that.
