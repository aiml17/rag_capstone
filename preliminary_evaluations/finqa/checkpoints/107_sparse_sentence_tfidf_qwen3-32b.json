The numbers are $136 million for 2015, $132 million for 2014, and $137 million for 2013. So adding those three together: 136 + 132 + 137.

The question is about the next 12 months from when? Since the context is from May 31, 2013, the next 12 months would be up to May 31, 2014.

The next ones are 2015, 2016, etc. So the next 12 months would be the first year listed, which is 2014. Therefore, the answer should be $11,057. Let me double-check.

For 2016, it's $4229 million, and for 2017, it's $5301 million.\n\nThe formula for percent change is ((New Value - Old Value) / Old Value) * 100. So here, the new value is 2017's figure, and the old value is 2016's. \n\nCalculating the difference: 5301 - 4229 = 1072. Then divide that by the old value (4229) to get the decimal form of the percentage. \n\n1072 divided by 4229 equals approximately 0.2535. Multiplying by 100 gives 25.35%. So the percent change is about 25.35%. \n\nWait, let me double-check the numbers. The 2016 value is definitely $4229 and 2017 is $5301? Yes, according to the table. The calculation seems right. Let me confirm the subtraction again: 5301 minus 4229. 5301 - 4000 is 1301, minus 229 more would be 1072. Correct. Then 1072 / 4229. Let me do that division again. 4229 * 0.25 is 1057.25.

Let me approximate. 43,634 divided by 94,205. Hmm, maybe I can simplify this. Let me see, 43,634 divided by 94,205. Well, 94,205 is roughly double 47,000, so 43,634 is a bit less than half of that. Let me calculate it more accurately.\n\nUsing a calculator: 43,634 \u00f7 94,205 \u2248 0.463. Multiply by 100 gives 46.3%. Wait, let me check again. Let me do the exact division. 43,634 divided by 94,205. Let me compute this step by step. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can cross-check. If total net revenue is 94,205 and net interest income is 43,634, then adding the noninterest revenue (50,571) to net interest income (43,634) gives 94,205, which matches the total. So that's correct. \n\nSo the percentage is (43,634 / 94,205) * 100. Let me compute that",

      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the information provided, in May 2008, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana issued $375 million of 6.00% series first mortgage bonds due May 2018.\n\nTo calculate the annual interest expense related to these bonds, we can multiply the principal amount by the interest rate:\n\n$375 million x 0.06 = $22.5 million\n\nTherefore, the annual interest expense related to the series first mortgage bonds due May 2018 is $22.5 million.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out the annual interest expense for the series first mortgage bonds due in May 2018. The context mentions that in May 2008, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana issued $375 million of 6.00% series first mortgage bonds. The question is asking for the annual interest expense related to these bonds.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how interest expense is calculated for bonds. Typically, the annual interest expense is the principal amount multiplied by the interest rate. Since these are first mortgage bonds with a fixed rate of 6.00%, that should be straightforward.\n\nSo the principal is $375 million, and the rate is 6%. Let me calculate that: 375,000,000 * 0.06 = 22,500,000. That would be $22.5 million per year in interest expense. \n\nBut wait, I should check if there's any other information that might affect this calculation. The context mentions that the proceeds from these bonds were used to pay off other bonds, but the interest expense for the new bonds should be based on their own terms. Also, the context states that there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility as of December 31, 2008, but that's about a different financing arrangement. \n\nThe key details here are the $375 million principal and the 6% rate. There's no mention of any discounts or premiums that would require amortization, so it's likely a straightforward interest calculation. Therefore, the annual interest expense should be 375 * 6% = 22.5 million dollars. \n\nI don't see any other factors mentioned that would change this calculation. The hurricanes and money pool details don't seem relevant to the interest expense on these specific bonds. Also, the regulatory approvals and filings are about future issuances, not affecting the existing 2008 issuance. \n\nSo the answer should be $22.5 million.\n</think>\n\nThe annual interest expense for the $375 million 6.00% series first mortgage bonds due May 2018 is calculated by multiplying the principal amount by the stated interest rate:  \n**$375 million \u00d7 6.00% = $22.5 million**.  \n\n**Answer:** 2",

First, I need to find the WTI prices for those years from the provided table.\n\nLooking at the table, the WTI crude oil prices are listed as:\n- 2011: $95.11\n- 2012: $94.15\n- 2013: $98.05\n\nWait, the question is from 2011 to 2013. So the starting value is 2011's $95.11 and ending at 2013's $98.05.

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking what portion of the total net reserves is related to the London market. Let me look at the context provided.\n\nFirst, there's a table mentioned with the environmental reserves. The table has rows for direct, assumed reinsurance, London market, total, ceded, and net. The numbers under \"total reserves\" for each category are given. \n\nLooking at the London market row, it says \"$57\". The total gross is 367 (sum of direct 271, assumed 39, London 57). Then there's a ceded amount of -47, which is subtracted to get the net of $320. \n\nSo the question is about the portion of the net reserves related to London market. Wait, but in the table, the London market is part of the gross reserves. The net reserves are total gross minus ceded. But does the London market have any ceded amount? The table shows \"ceded\" as -47 in total. The problem is whether the London market's portion is part of that ceded amount. The table structure might imply that the ceded amount applies to the total, but the London market's contribution to net would be its gross amount minus any ceded related to it. However, the table doesn't break down ceded by category. \n\nBut according to the table, the London market's gross is 57. The total ceded is -47. The net is total gross (367) minus ceded (47) equals 320. However, the question is about the portion of the net reserves related to London market. If the ceded amount is applied uniformly or if the London market's ceded is part of that -47, but since the table doesn't specify, maybe we need to assume that the London market's net is its gross amount minus any ceded related to it. But since the ceded is only given as a total, perhaps the London market's net is just 57, and the total net is 320. Wait, but that can't be right because ceded is subtracted from the total. \n\nWait, the table shows \"ceded\" as -47 (47 in parentheses), which is subtracted from the total gross of 367 to get the net of 320.

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking what portion of the total bankruptcy settlement obligations are related to labor deemed claims. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the context provided. There's a table mentioned with different components of \"claims and other bankruptcy settlement obligations\" as of December 31, 2013. The components listed are AAG Series A Preferred Stock ($3329 million), Single-dip equity obligations ($1246 million), Labor-related deemed claim ($849 million), and the total is $5424 million.\n\nThe question is specifically about the labor-related portion. From the table, the labor-related deemed claim is $849 million. The total is $5424 million. To find the portion, I need to divide the labor-related amount by the total and then convert that to a percentage.\n\nSo, $849 divided by $5424. Let me do that calculation. Let me check if I have the numbers right. Yes, 849 over 5424. Let me compute that. \n\nFirst, maybe simplify the numbers. Let's see, 5424 divided by 849. Wait, no, I need 849 divided by 5424. Let me calculate that. \n\nDividing 849 by 5424. Let me approximate. 5424 times 0.15 is 813.6. Since 849 is a bit higher than that, maybe around 15.6% or so. Let me do the exact division: 849 \u00f7 5424. \n\nUsing a calculator, 849 \u00f7 5424 \u2248 0.1565. So that's approximately 15.65%. \n\nBut the question is asking for the portion, so maybe they just want the exact fraction or the percentage rounded. The answer should be the labor-related deemed claim divided by the total. The exact value is 849/5424. Let me check if that reduces. Let's see if both numbers can be divided by 3. 849 \u00f73 is 283, 5424 \u00f73 is 1808. So 283/1808.",
