      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking for the value of rent expense and certain office equipment expense under lease agreements between 2013 and 2015. The context provided mentions those expenses for 2015, 2014, and 2013.\n\nLooking at the context, there's a sentence that says: \"rent expense and certain office equipment expense under lease agreements amounted to $136 million, $132 million and $137 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\" So, the numbers are given for each of those years. The user wants the total between 2013 and 2015. \n\nWait, the order here is important. The numbers are listed as 2015, 2014, 2013. Let me check again. The sentence says: \"$136 million, $132 million and $137 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\" So respectively, meaning the first number is 2015, then 2014, then 2013. So 2015: 136, 2014: 132, 2013: 137. \n\nThe question is asking for the total between 2013 and 2015. So that would be adding 2013, 2014, and 2015. Let me add them up: 137 (2013) + 132 (2014) + 136 (2015). Let me calculate that. 137 + 132 is 269, plus 136 is 405. So the total is $405 million. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other numbers mentioned for those years. The context also has some other numbers related to future commitments and investments, but the question specifically asks about rent expense and office equipment expense under lease agreements. The other parts mention future minimum commitments for operating leases, but that's different from the actual expenses incurred in 2013-2015",

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking about the portion of future minimum lease payments due in the next 12 months. The context provided includes a table with future minimum lease payments for different fiscal years ending May 31.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which of those fiscal years fall within the next 12 months from the date mentioned. The context is as of May 31, 2013. The next 12 months from that date would be up to May 31, 2014. Looking at the fiscal years listed, the first one is 2014, which ends on May 31, 2014. So the payments for 2014 would be due within the next 12 months. The amount for 2014 is $11,057.\n\nI should check if there are any other years that might overlap. For example, if the fiscal years were different, but in this case, the next fiscal year after 2013 is 2014. Since the payments are for non-cancelable operating leases, and the next fiscal year is 2014, which is entirely within the next 12 months from May 31, 2013. Therefore, the amount due in the next 12 months is the 2014 payment of $11,057. The other years (2015 onwards) are beyond that 12-month period. The \"thereafter\" category is also beyond 5 years, so not relevant here.\n\nSo the answer should be $11,057. Let me confirm the numbers again. The table lists [\"2014\", \"$ 11057\"], so that's correct. The question is about the next 12 months from May 31, 2013, which would cover up to May 31, 2014. Hence, the 2014 fiscal year's payment is the one due in the next 12 months.\n</think>\n\nThe portion of future minimum lease payments due in the next 12 months corresponds to the fiscal year 2014, which is **$11,057**.

For 2016, it's $4229 million, and for 2017, it's $5301 million.\n\nThe formula for percent change is ((New Value - Old Value) / Old Value) * 100. So here, the new value is 2017's figure, and the old value is 2016's. \n\nCalculating the difference: 5301 - 4229 = 1072. Then divide that by 4229. Let me do that division: 1072 / 4229 \u2248 0.2535.

      "question": "what percentage of total net revenue was due to net interest income in 2014?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "In 2014, the total net revenue was $94,205 million. Net interest income was $43,634 million.\n\nTo calculate the percentage of total net revenue due to net interest income in 2014:\n(Net Interest Income / Total Net Revenue) x 100\n= ($43,634 / $94,205) x 100\n\u2248 46.3%\n\nTherefore, about 46.3% of the total net revenue in 2014 was due to net interest income.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking what percentage of total net revenue was due to net interest income in 2014. Alright, so I need to find the net interest income for 2014 and the total net revenue for the same year, then calculate the percentage.\n\nLooking at the provided data, there's a table with various revenue categories. Let me scan through it. The rows include \"Net interest income\" and \"Total net revenue\". For 2014, net interest income is $43,634 million, and total net revenue is $94,205 million. \n\nWait, let me confirm. The table lists \"Net interest income\" as $43,634 million for 2014 and \"Total net revenue\" as $94,205 million. To find the percentage, I need to divide net interest income by total net revenue and multiply by 100. \n\nSo the calculation would be (43,634 / 94,205) * 100. Let me do that. First, divide 43,634 by 94,205. Let me approximate. 43,634 divided by 94,205. Let me see, 94,205 times 0.46 is approximately 43,334. Hmm, so maybe around 46.3%? Let me check with exact numbers.\n\nUsing a calculator: 43,634 \u00f7 94,205 = approximately 0.4631. Multiply by 100 gives 46.31%. So the percentage is approximately 46.3%. \n\nWait, but I should make sure that the numbers are correct. Let me cross-verify. The total net revenue for 2014 is $94,205 million, which is the sum of noninterest revenue ($50,571 million) and net interest income ($43,634 million). Adding those gives 50,571 + 43,634 = 94,205, which matches the total net revenue. So the numbers are correct. \n\nTherefore, the percentage is indeed (43,634",

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out the annual interest expense related to the Series First Mortgage Bonds due May 2018. The context mentions that in May 2008, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana issued $375 million of 6.00% Series First Mortgage Bonds due May 2018. The question is asking for the annual interest expense on these bonds.\n\nFirst, I know that interest expense for bonds is typically calculated by multiplying the principal amount by the interest rate. The principal here is $375 million, and the rate is 6.00%. So, 375 million times 6% should give the annual interest. Let me check if there's any other information that might affect this calculation.\n\nLooking back at the context, the proceeds from these bonds were used to pay off other bonds and for corporate purposes. However, the interest expense on the new bonds should be straightforward. The rate is fixed at 6%, so unless there's some discount or premium mentioned, it's just principal times rate. The context doesn't mention any discounts or premiums related to these bonds, so I can assume a straightforward calculation.\n\nSo, 375 million * 6% equals 22.5 million. Therefore, the annual interest expense should be $22.5 million. Let me make sure there are no other factors. The bonds were issued in May 2008, but since the question is about the annual expense, it's probably on a full-year basis. Even if they were issued mid-year, the total annual expense for the bonds would still be based on the full principal and rate. The context doesn't mention any changes to the bonds after issuance, so the calculation holds.\n</think>\n\nThe annual interest expense for the $375 million 6.00% Series First Mortgage Bonds due May 2018 is calculated by multiplying the principal amount by the interest rate:  \n$375 million \u00d7 6.00% = **$22.5 million**.  \n\n**Answer:** 22.5 million.",

The first line item is \"compensation and benefits\" with values for 2014 and 2013. For 2014, it's $8368 million, and for 2013, it's $7874 million. \n\nTo find the change, I subtract the 2013 value from the 2014 value. So that's 8368 minus 7874. Let me do the math here. \n\n8368 minus 7874 equals... let's see, 8368 - 7800 is 568, and then subtract 74 more, which gives 568 -74 = 494. So the change is $494 million. \n\nWait, let me double-check that calculation to be sure. 7874 plus 494 would be 7874 + 400 = 8274, then +94 = 8368. Yes, that adds up correctly.

The question is asking what portion of the total net reserves is related to the London Market. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the context provided. There's a table mentioned with environmental reserves as of December 31, 2011. The table has categories like Direct, Assumed Reinsurance, London Market, Total, Ceded, and Net. \n\nLooking at the numbers: the London Market is listed as $57. The total gross is 367, but then there's a ceded amount of -47, leading to a net of $320. The question is about the net reserves, so I need to find out how much of that $320 is from London Market.\n\nWait, but the London Market is part of the gross. The table shows \"gross [1][2]\" with Direct $271, Assumed Reinsurance $39, London Market $57, and total $367. Then ceded is -47, so net is $320. But the question is about the portion of net reserves related to London Market. \n\nBut the problem is, the ceded amount might be affecting the net. However, the table doesn't break down ceded by category. The ceded is a total figure (-47). So how do we adjust London Market's portion? \n\nWait, maybe the ceded is applied to the total gross. The total gross is 367, ceded is 47, so net is 320. But the question is about the portion of net related to London Market. If the ceded is a total, perhaps the London Market's portion isn't directly adjusted by ceded? Or is there any indication that ceded is specific to certain categories?\n\nThe context doesn't specify how the ceded amount is allocated between Direct, Assumed Reinsurance, and London Market. Without that information, perhaps we can't directly calculate the net portion for London Market. However, maybe the question assumes that the ceded is only for certain parts. Wait, the table shows \"ceded\" as -47 (47) under total. So maybe the ceded is a total amount subtracted from the total gross. Therefore, the net reserves are total gross minus ceded.

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking what portion of the total bankruptcy settlement obligations are related to labor deemed claims. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the context provided. There's a table mentioned with different components of \"claims and other bankruptcy settlement obligations\" as of December 31, 2013. The components listed are AAG Series A Preferred Stock ($3329 million), Single-dip equity obligations ($1246 million), Labor-related deemed claim ($849 million), and the total is $5424 million.\n\nThe question is specifically about the labor-related deemed claim. So, the total is $5424 million, and the labor portion is $849 million. To find the portion, I need to calculate the percentage that $849 million is of $5424 million.\n\nLet me do the math. The formula is (Part / Whole) * 100. So, 849 divided by 5424, then multiplied by 100. Let me compute that. \n\nFirst, divide 849 by 5424. Let me see, 5424 divided by 100 is 54.24, so 849 divided by 54.24 would be roughly 15.66%. Wait, let me check again. 5424 * 0.15 = 813.6. 5424 * 0.156 = 5424 * 0.15 + 5424 * 0.006 = 813.6 + 32.544 = 846.144. That's very close to 849. So approximately 15.66%. \n\nBut the exact calculation would be 849 / 5424 = 0.1565... which is 15.65%. The answer might need to be in exact numbers or rounded. The question says \"portion,\" so maybe they want the exact figure. Let me check the numbers again to make sure I have them right.
