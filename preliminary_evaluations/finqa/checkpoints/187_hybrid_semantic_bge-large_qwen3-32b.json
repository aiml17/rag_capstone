      "ground_truth_answer": "Between 2013 and 2015, the value of rent expense and certain office equipment expense under lease agreements amounted to $ 137 million in 2013, $ 132 million in 2014, and $ 136 million in 2015.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking for the value of rent expense and certain office equipment expense under lease agreements between 2013 and 2015. The context provided has some numbers for those years.\n\nLooking at the context, there's a sentence that says: \"rent expense and certain office equipment expense under lease agreements amounted to $136 million, $132 million and $137 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\" \n\nWait, the order here is important. The years mentioned are 2015, 2014, 2013 but the values are listed as $136, $132, $137. The word \"respectively\" means that each value corresponds to the year in the same order. So 2015 is $136 million, 2014 is $132 million, and 2013 is $137 million. \n\nThe question is asking for the total between 2013 and 2015. So I need to add up the three years. Let me check the numbers again to make sure. 2013: $137M, 2014: $132M, 2015: $136M. Adding them together: 137 + 132 + 136. Let me do the math. \n\n137 + 132 is 269. Then 269 + 136 is 405. So the total rent expense from 2013 to 2015 is $405 million. \n\nI need to confirm that there's no other information in the context that might affect this answer. The rest of the context talks about operating lease commitments, capital commitments, and other financial details, but those don't seem relevant to the rent expenses for those three years. The numbers given are straightforward. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 405 million dollars.\n</think>\n\nThe value of rent expense and certain office equipment expense under lease agreements between 2013 and 2015 is calculated by summing the expenses for each year:  \n- **2013**: $13",

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking for the percent change in principal transactions revenue related to interest rate risks from 2016 to 2017. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the context provided. The table has rows for different risk categories. The first row under \"interest rate risks (1)\" shows the values for 2018, 2017, and 2016 as $5186 million, $5301 million, and $4229 million respectively.\n\nThe question is about the change from 2016 to 2017. So the numbers we need are 2017's value ($5301 million) and 2016's value ($4229 million). \n\nTo calculate the percent change, the formula is ((New Value - Old Value)/Old Value) * 100. Here, the new value is 2017's figure, and the old value is 2016's. \n\nSo subtracting 4229 from 5301 gives 1072. Then divide that by 4229. Let me do the division: 1072 / 4229 \u2248 0.2535. Multiplying by 100 gives approximately 25.35%. \n\nI should check if there's any note that might affect these numbers.

Also, the footnotes explain what's included, but they don't mention any adjustments for the years in question here. \n\nTherefore, the percent change is approximately a 25.35% increase. Rounding to two decimal places, maybe 25.35%, or perhaps they want it rounded to one decimal or as a whole number. The answer might expect one decimal place, so 25.4%. Let me confirm the exact calculation again:\n\n5301 - 4229 = 1072\n\n1072 / 4229 = 0.2535... Multiply by 100 = 25.35%. So 25.35",

Alright, first I need to find the numbers for collateral posted in those two years.\n\nLooking at the context provided, there's a table with different rows. The second row is \"collateral posted\" with values for 2012 and 2011. The numbers are in millions. For 2012, it's 24296 million, and for 2011, it's 29002 million. Wait, so the collateral posted decreased from 2011 to 2012. \n\nTo calculate the percentage change, the formula is ((New Value - Old Value)/Old Value) * 100. But wait, here the old value would be 2011's value, and the new value is 2012's. So plugging in the numbers: (24296 - 29002)/29002 * 100. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, subtract 29002 from 24296: 24296 - 29002 = -4706. Then divide that by 29002: -4706 / 29002 \u2248 -0.1623. Multiply by 100 to get the percentage: -16.23%.

The difference is indeed a decrease of 4706 million. Dividing by the original 2011 value gives the percentage decrease. The calculation seems right. So the answer should be a -16.23% change, or a 16.23% decrease. Since percentage change is often expressed as a positive or negative number, depending on whether it's an increase or decrease. The question just asks for the percentage change, so the negative sign indicates a decrease. I think that's all.",

Looking at the table, there's a row labeled \"net interest income\" which is $43,634 million for 2014.

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out the annual interest expense for the 6% Series First Mortgage Bonds due May 2018. The context says that Entergy Gulf States Louisiana issued $375 million of these bonds in May 2008. The interest rate is 6.00%. \n\nSo, annual interest expense is typically calculated by multiplying the principal amount by the interest rate. Let me check if there's any other information that might affect this calculation. The bonds were issued in 2008 and due in 2018, so they have a 10-year term. The question is asking for the annual interest expense related to these bonds.\n\nThe principal is $375 million, and the rate is 6%. So 375 million times 6% equals $22.5 million per year. Wait, but I need to make sure there's no other factors here. The context mentions that the proceeds were used to pay off other bonds, but that shouldn't affect the interest expense on the new bonds. Also, there's mention of other bonds being assumed by Entergy Texas, but those are separate. The question is specifically about the May 2018 bonds. \n\nThe answer should be straightforward: 375 * 0.06 = 22.5. So $22.5 million annually. I don't see any other details that would change this. The other numbers in the context, like the $325 million and $350 million bonds, are about previous bonds that were paid off, but the question is about the 2018 bonds. \n\nTherefore, the annual interest expense is $22.5 million.\n</think>\n\nThe annual interest expense for the 6.00% Series First Mortgage Bonds due May 2018 is calculated by multiplying the principal amount ($375 million) by the interest rate (6.00%). \n\n**Calculation:**  \n$375 million \u00d7 6.00% = $22.5 million.\n\n**Answer:** 22.5",

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking for the percentage increase in the average price of WTI crude oil from 2011 to 2013. First, I need to find the prices for those years from the provided table.\n\nLooking at the table, under \"wti crude oil (dollars per bbl)\", the values are $98.05 for 2013 and $95.11 for 2011. Wait, actually, the years are listed as 2013, 2012, 2011. Let me check again. The first row is [\"benchmark\", \"2013\", \"2012\", \"2011\"], then the WTI row is [\"wti crude oil ( dollars per bbl )\", \"$ 98.05\", \"$ 94.15\", \"$ 95.11\"]. So the 2011 price is $95.11 and 2013 is $98.05. \n\nTo calculate the percentage increase, the formula is ((New Value - Old Value)/Old Value) * 100. So here, New Value is 2013's $98.05 and Old Value is 2011's $95.11. \n\nSubtracting 95.11 from 98.05 gives 2.94. Then divide that by 95.11. Let me compute that: 2.94 / 95.11 \u2248 0.0309. Multiply by 100 gives approximately 3.09%. \n\nWait, but let me double-check the numbers. The 2011 price is $95.11 and 2013 is $98.05. The difference is indeed $2.94. Dividing 2.94 by 95.11. Let me do that division more accurately. 95.11 times 3% is 2.8533, which is close to 2.94. So maybe it's a bit higher than 3%. Let me calculate 2.94 / 95.11. Let's see, 9",

The context provided includes a table with various line items, including \"compensation and benefits\" for both years.\n\nFirst, I need to locate the relevant numbers. From the context, the row for \"compensation and benefits\" shows \"$ 8368\" for 2014 (as of December 2014) and \"$ 7874\" for 2013 (as of December 2013). The question is about the change between these two years. \n\nTo find the change, I subtract the 2013 value from the 2014 value. So, 8368 minus 7874.

Let me look at the context provided.\n\nFirst, there's a table with different categories. The first row has \"total reserves\", then there's a breakdown into \"gross\" with subcategories: direct, assumed reinsurance, London market, total, ceded, and net. \n\nLooking at the numbers: under the \"gross\" section, London market is listed as $57.

So the net reserves are calculated by subtracting ceded from total gross. But does the London Market's portion get affected by the ceded amount? Hmm. The way the table is structured, the total gross is 367, which includes direct (271), assumed reinsurance (39), and London market (57). Then ceded is -47, leading to net of 320. But the question is about the portion of the net reserves related to London Market. \n\nBut how is the ceded amount allocated? The problem doesn't specify that the ceded amount is only from a specific category. So maybe the ceded is a total figure, not broken down by each subcategory. Therefore, to find the portion of London Market in the net reserves, we can take the London Market's gross amount and subtract any portion of the ceded that relates to it. However, since the ceded is not broken down by subcategory, perhaps we can assume that the ceded amount is a total, and the net is total gross minus total ceded. \n\nBut if we don't have the breakdown of ceded by category, we can't directly calculate the exact net for London Market. However, maybe the question is expecting a simple proportion based on the gross. For example, London Market is 57 out of total gross 367. Then, the net is 320. If the ceded is uniformly applied, then the portion of London Market in net would still be the same proportion. \n\nSo, 57 divided by 367 gives the",
