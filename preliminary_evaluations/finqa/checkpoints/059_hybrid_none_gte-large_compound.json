firm enters into a broad array of credit derivatives in locations around the world to facilitate client transactions and to manage the credit risk associated with market- making and investing and lending activities . credit derivatives are actively managed based on the firm 2019s net risk position . credit derivatives are individually negotiated contracts and can have various settlement and payment conventions . credit events include failure to pay , bankruptcy , acceleration of indebtedness , restructuring , repudiation and dissolution of the reference entity . credit default swaps . single-name credit default swaps protect the buyer against the loss of principal on one or more bonds , loans or mortgages ( reference obligations ) in the event the issuer ( reference entity ) of the reference obligations suffers a credit event . the buyer of protection pays an initial or periodic premium to the seller and receives protection for the period of the contract . if there is no credit event , as defined in the contract , the seller of protection makes no payments to the buyer of protection . however , if a credit event occurs , the seller of protection is required to make a payment to the buyer of protection , which is calculated in accordance with the terms of the contract . credit indices , baskets and tranches . credit derivatives may reference a basket of single-name credit default swaps or a broad-based index . if a credit event occurs in one of the underlying reference obligations , the protection seller pays the protection buyer . the payment is typically a pro-rata portion of the transaction 2019s total notional amount based on the underlying defaulted reference obligation . in certain transactions , the credit risk of a basket or index is separated into various portions ( tranches ) , each having different levels of subordination . the most junior tranches cover initial defaults and once losses exceed the notional amount of these junior tranches , any excess loss is covered by the next most senior tranche in the capital structure . total return swaps . a total return swap transfers the risks relating to economic performance of a reference obligation from the protection buyer to the protection seller . typically , the protection buyer receives from the protection seller a floating rate of interest and protection against any reduction in fair value of the reference obligation , and in return the protection seller receives the cash flows associated with the reference obligation , plus any increase in the fair value of the reference obligation . credit options . in a credit option , the option writer assumes the obligation to purchase or sell a reference obligation at a specified price or credit spread . the option purchaser buys the right , but does not assume the obligation , to sell the reference obligation to , or purchase it from , the option writer . the payments on credit options depend either on a particular credit spread or the price of the reference obligation . the firm economically hedges its exposure to written credit derivatives primarily by entering into offsetting purchased credit derivatives with identical underlyings . substantially all of the firm 2019s purchased credit derivative transactions are with financial institutions and are subject to stringent collateral thresholds . in addition , upon the occurrence of a specified trigger event , the firm may take possession of the reference obligations underlying a particular written credit derivative , and consequently may , upon liquidation of the reference obligations , recover amounts on the underlying reference obligations in the event of default . 140 goldman sachs 2012 annual report ."

( b ) included operating lease income of $ 1.7 billion , $ 1.5 billion and $ 1.3 billion for the years ended december 31 , 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively . 2014 compared with 2013 total net revenue for 2014 was down by $ 2.4 billion , or 2% ( 2 % ) , compared with the prior year , predominantly due to lower mortgage fees and related income , and lower other income . the decrease was partially offset by higher asset management , administration and commissions revenue . investment banking fees increased compared with the prior year , due to higher advisory and equity underwriting fees , largely offset by lower debt underwriting fees . the increase in advisory fees was driven by the combined impact of a greater share of fees for completed transactions , and growth in industry-wide fee levels . the increase in equity underwriting fees was driven by higher industry-wide issuance . the decrease in debt underwriting fees was primarily related to lower bond underwriting compared with a stronger prior year , and lower loan syndication fees on lower industry-wide fee levels . investment banking fee share and industry-wide data are sourced from dealogic , an external vendor . for additional information on investment banking fees , see cib segment results on pages 92 201396 , cb segment results on pages 97 201399 , and note 7 . principal transactions revenue , which consists of revenue primarily from the firm 2019s client-driven market-making and private equity investing activities , increased compared with the prior year as the prior year included a $ 1.5 billion loss related to the implementation of the fva framework for otc derivatives and structured notes . the increase was also due to higher private equity gains as a result of higher net gains on sales . the increase was partially offset by lower fixed income markets revenue in cib , primarily driven by credit- related and rates products , as well as the impact of business simplification initiatives . for additional information on principal transactions revenue , see cib and corporate segment results on pages 92 201396 and pages 103 2013104 , respectively , and note 7 . lending- and deposit-related fees decreased compared with the prior year , reflecting the impact of business simplification initiatives and lower trade finance revenue in cib . for additional information on lending- and deposit- related fees , see the segment results for ccb on pages 81 2013 91 , cib on pages 92 201396 and cb on pages 97 201399 . asset management , administration and commissions revenue increased compared with the prior year , reflecting higher asset management fees driven by net client inflows and the effect of higher market levels in am and ccb . the increase was offset partially by lower commissions and other fee revenue in ccb as a result of the exit of a non-core product in the second half of 2013 . for additional information on these fees and commissions , see the segment discussions of ccb on pages 81 201391 , am on pages 100 2013102 , and note 7 . securities gains decreased compared with the prior year , reflecting lower repositioning activity related to the firm 2019s investment securities portfolio . for additional information , see the corporate segment discussion on pages 103 2013104 and note 12 . mortgage fees and related income decreased compared with the prior year . the decrease was predominantly due to lower net production revenue driven by lower volumes due to higher levels of mortgage interest rates , and tighter margins . the decline in net production revenue was partially offset by a lower loss on the risk management of mortgage servicing rights ( 201cmsrs 201d ) . for additional information , see the segment discussion of ccb on pages 85 201387 and note 17 . card income remained relatively flat but included higher net interchange income on credit and debit cards due to growth in sales volume , offset by higher amortization of new account origination costs . for additional information on credit card income , see ccb segment results on pages 81 201391. ."

[2] the three year average gross paid amount for total environmental claims is $ 58 , resulting in a three year gross survival ratio of 6.4 . during the second quarters of 2011 , 2010 and 2009 , the company completed its annual ground-up asbestos reserve evaluations . as part of these evaluations , the company reviewed all of its open direct domestic insurance accounts exposed to asbestos liability , as well as assumed reinsurance accounts and its london market exposures for both direct insurance and assumed reinsurance . based on this evaluation , the company strengthened its net asbestos reserves by $ 290 in second quarter 2011 . during 2011 , for certain direct policyholders , the company experienced increases in claim frequency , severity and expense which were driven by mesothelioma claims , particularly against certain smaller , more peripheral insureds . the company also experienced unfavorable development on its assumed reinsurance accounts driven largely by the same factors experienced by the direct policyholders . during 2010 and 2009 , for certain direct policyholders , the company experienced increases in claim severity and expense . increases in severity and expense were driven by litigation in certain jurisdictions and , to a lesser extent , development on primarily peripheral accounts . the company also experienced unfavorable development on its assumed reinsurance accounts driven largely by the same factors experienced by the direct policyholders . the net effect of these changes in 2010 and 2009 resulted in $ 169 and $ 138 increases in net asbestos reserves , respectively . the company currently expects to continue to perform an evaluation of its asbestos liabilities annually . the company divides its gross asbestos exposures into direct , assumed reinsurance and london market . the company further divides its direct asbestos exposures into the following categories : major asbestos defendants ( the 201ctop 70 201d accounts in tillinghast 2019s published tiers 1 and 2 and wellington accounts ) , which are subdivided further as : structured settlements , wellington , other major asbestos defendants , accounts with future expected exposures greater than $ 2.5 , accounts with future expected exposures less than $ 2.5 , and unallocated . 2022 structured settlements are those accounts where the company has reached an agreement with the insured as to the amount and timing of the claim payments to be made to the insured . 2022 the wellington subcategory includes insureds that entered into the 201cwellington agreement 201d dated june 19 , 1985 . the wellington agreement provided terms and conditions for how the signatory asbestos producers would access their coverage from the signatory insurers . 2022 the other major asbestos defendants subcategory represents insureds included in tiers 1 and 2 , as defined by tillinghast that are not wellington signatories and have not entered into structured settlements with the hartford . the tier 1 and 2 classifications are meant to capture the insureds for which there is expected to be significant exposure to asbestos claims . 2022 accounts with future expected exposures greater or less than $ 2.5 include accounts that are not major asbestos defendants . 2022 the unallocated category includes an estimate of the reserves necessary for asbestos claims related to direct insureds that have not previously tendered asbestos claims to the company and exposures related to liability claims that may not be subject to an aggregate limit under the applicable policies . an account may move between categories from one evaluation to the next . for example , an account with future expected exposure of greater than $ 2.5 in one evaluation may be reevaluated due to changing conditions and recategorized as less than $ 2.5 in a subsequent evaluation or vice versa. ."

      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the information provided in the context, the portion of the total bankruptcy settlement obligations that are related to labor-related deemed claims is $849 million.\n\nThe context states that \"the remaining liability to certain american labor groups and employees of $ 849 million is based upon the estimated fair value of the shares of aag common stock expected to be issued in satisfaction of such obligation\".\n\nThe total bankruptcy settlement obligations are listed as:\n- \"AAG Series A Preferred Stock\": $3,329 million\n- \"Single-dip Equity Obligations\": $1,246 million\n- \"Labor-related Deemed Claim\": $849 million\n- Total: $5,424 million\n\nTherefore, the labor-related deemed claim of $849 million represents approximately 15.6% of the total $5,424 million in bankruptcy settlement obligations.",

        "table of contents 3 . bankruptcy settlement obligations as of december 31 , 2013 , the components of \"claims and other bankruptcy settlement obligations\" on american's consolidated balance sheet are as follows ( in millions ) : .\n\n[[\"aag series a preferred stock\", \"$ 3329\"], [\"single-dip equity obligations\", \"1246\"], [\"labor-related deemed claim\", \"849\"], [\"total\", \"$ 5424\"]]\n\nas a mechanism for satisfying double-dip unsecured claims and a portion of single-dip unsecured claims , the plan of reorganization provided that such claimholders receive the mandatorily convertible aag series a preferred stock . aag's series a preferred stock , while outstanding , votes and participates in accordance with the terms of the underlying certificate of designation . one quarter of the shares of aag series a preferred stock is mandatorily convertible on each of the 30 th , 60th , 90th and 120th days after the effective date . in addition , subject to certain limitations , holders of aag series a preferred stock may elect to convert up to 10 million shares of aag series a preferred stock during each 30-day period following the effective date thereby reducing the number of aag series a preferred stock to be converted on the 120 th day after the effective date . the initial stated value of each share of aag series a preferred stock is $ 25.00 and accrues dividends at 6.25% ( 6.25 % ) per annum , calculated daily , while outstanding . additionally , aag series a preferred stock converts to aag common stock based upon the volume weighted average price of the shares of aag common stock on the five trading days immediately preceding the conversion date , at a 3.5% ( 3.5 % ) fixed discount , subject to a conversion price floor of $ 10.875 per share and a conversion price cap of $ 33.8080 per share , below or above which the conversion rate remains fixed . aag series a preferred stock embodies an unconditional obligation to transfer a variable number of shares based predominately on a fixed monetary amount known at inception , and , as such , it is not treated as equity of aag , but rather as a liability until such time that it is converted to aag common stock . accordingly , american has reflected the amount of its claims satisfied through the issuance of the aag series a preferred stock as a liability included within the \"bankruptcy settlement obligations\" line on american 2019s consolidated balance sheets and will reflect such obligations as a liability until such time where they are satisfied through the issuance of aag common stock . upon the satisfaction of these bankruptcy settlement obligations with aag common stock , the company will record an increase in additional paid-in capital through an intercompany equity transfer while derecognizing the related bankruptcy settlement obligation at that time . as of february 19 , 2014 , approximately 107 million shares of aag series a preferred stock had been converted into an aggregate of 95 million shares of aag common stock . the single-dip equity obligations , while outstanding , do not vote or participate in accordance with the terms of the plan . these equity contract obligations , representing the amount of total single-dip unsecured creditor obligations not satisfied through the issuance of aag series a preferred stock at the effective date , represent an unconditional obligation to transfer a variable number of shares of aag common stock based predominantly on a fixed monetary amount known at inception , and , as such , are not treated as equity , but rather as liabilities until the 120 th day after emergence . at the 120 th day after emergence , aag will issue a variable amount of aag common stock necessary to satisfy the obligation amount at emergence , plus accrued dividends of 12% ( 12 % ) per annum , calculated daily , through the 120 th day after emergence , based on the volume weighted average price of the shares of aag common stock , at a 3.5% ( 3.5 % ) discount , as specified in the plan and subject to there being a sufficient number of shares remaining for issuance to unsecured creditors under the plan . in exchange for employees' contributions to the successful reorganization of aag , including agreeing to reductions in pay and benefits , aag and american agreed in the plan to provide each employee group a deemed claim which was used to provide a distribution of a portion of the equity of the reorganized entity to those employees . each employee group received a deemed claim amount based upon a fixed percentage of the distributions to be made to general unsecured claimholders . the fair value based on the expected number of shares to be distributed to satisfy this deemed claim was approximately $ 1.7 billion . on the effective date , aag made an initial distribution of $ 595 million in common stock and american paid approximately $ 300 million in cash to cover payroll taxes related to the equity distribution . as of december 31 , 2013 , the remaining liability to certain american labor groups and employees of $ 849 million is based upon the estimated fair value of the shares of aag common stock expected to be issued in satisfaction of such obligation , measured as if the obligation were settled using the trading price of aag common stock at december 31 , 2013 . increases in the trading price of aag common stock after december 31 , 2013 , could cause a decrease in the fair value measurement of the remaining obligation , and vice-versa . american will record this obligation at fair value primarily through the 120 th day after emergence , at which time the obligation will be materially settled. ."
