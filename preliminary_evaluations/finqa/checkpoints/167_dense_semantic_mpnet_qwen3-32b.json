      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking for the value of rent expense and certain office equipment expense under lease agreements between 2013 and 2015. The context provided has some information about that.\n\nLooking at the context, there's a section that says: \"rent expense and certain office equipment expense under lease agreements amounted to $136 million, $132 million and $137 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\" Wait, the order here is 2015, 2014, 2013. Let me parse that again. The numbers are given as $136 million for 2015, $132 million for 2014, and $137 million for 2013. \n\nSo the question is asking for the total between 2013 and 2015. That would be adding up the three years. Let me check the numbers again to make sure. 2013 is $137 million, 2014 is $132 million, and 2015 is $136 million. Adding those together: 137 + 132 + 136. Let me do the math. \n\n137 + 132 is 269. Then 269 + 136 is 405. So the total rent expense from 2013 to 2015 would be $405 million. \n\nWait, but the question says \"between 2013 and 2015\". Does that include all three years? Yes, because 2013, 2014, and 2015 are all within that range. So the answer should be 405 million dollars. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other numbers in the context that could be relevant. The rest of the context talks about operating lease commitments, future minimum commitments, investment commitments, etc., but those don't relate to the actual expenses incurred in those years. The rent expenses for each year are explicitly listed, so adding them up gives the correct total. \n\nTherefore, the answer is $405 million.\n</think>\n\nThe value of rent expense",

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking what portion of the future minimum lease payments are due in the next 12 months. The context provided has a table with the future minimum lease payments for different fiscal years.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which of those fiscal years fall within the next 12 months from the date mentioned. The context says the data is as of May 31, 2013. The next 12 months from that date would be up to May 31, 2014. So, any payments due in the fiscal year ending May 31, 2014, would be within the next 12 months.\n\nLooking at the table, the first entry is for 2014 with $11,057. The next one is 2015, which would be after the 12-month period. So the portion due in the next 12 months is just the 2014 amount. \n\nWait, but the fiscal years are ending on May 31 each year. So the 2014 fiscal year is from June 1, 2013, to May 31, 2014. Since the current date is May 31, 2013, the next fiscal year (2014) starts right after. Therefore, the entire 2014 payment of $11,057 is due within the next 12 months. The other years (2015 onwards) are beyond that 12-month window. \n\nSo the answer should be $11,057. Let me check the total to make sure. The total future minimum lease payments are $57,096. But the question isn't asking for the total, just the portion in the next 12 months. Yep, that's definitely the 2014 entry. No other entries are within the next year. The \"thereafter\" category is for after 2018, so that's way beyond. So the answer is $11,057.\n</think>\n\nThe portion of future minimum lease payments due in the next 12 months (as of May 31, 2013) corresponds to the fiscal year ending May 31, 2014",

The user is asking for the percent change in principal transactions revenue related to interest rate risks from 2016 to 2017. \n\nFirst, I need to find the values for interest rate risks in those years. Looking at the table provided, the row labeled \"interest rate risks (1)\" has the numbers. For 2017, it's $5,301 million, and for 2016, it's $4,229 million.\n\nThe formula for percent change is ((New Value - Old Value) / Old Value) * 100. So plugging in the numbers: (5301 - 4229) / 4229 * 100. Let me calculate that step by step.\n\nSubtracting 4229 from 5301 gives 1072. Then divide 1072 by 4229. Let me do that division. 1072 \u00f7 4229 \u2248 0.2535. Multiplying by 100 gives approximately 25.35%. \n\nWait, let me double-check the division. Maybe I should use a calculator for precision. But since I'm doing this manually, 4229 times 0.25 is 1057.25, which is close to 1072. So the difference is about 14.75 over 4229, which adds roughly another 0.35%. So total around 25.35% makes sense. \n\nSo the percent change is approximately 25.35%. Rounded to two decimal places, that's 25.35%. The answer should be presented as a percentage with one decimal place maybe? The question doesn't specify, but usually one or two decimals are acceptable. Let me confirm the exact numbers again to make sure I didn't mix up the years. 2017 is $5,301 and 2016 is $4,229. Yes, correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer is a 25.35% increase from 2016 to 2017.\n</think>\n\nThe percent change in principal transactions revenue associated with interest rate risks from",

      "question": "what is the annual interest expense related to series first mortgage bonds due may 2018 , in millions?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the information provided, in May 2008, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana issued $375 million of 6.00% series first mortgage bonds due May 2018.\n\nTo calculate the annual interest expense related to these bonds, we can multiply the principal amount by the interest rate:\n\n$375 million x 0.06 = $22.5 million\n\nTherefore, the annual interest expense related to the series first mortgage bonds due May 2018 is $22.5 million.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out the annual interest expense for the 6% Series First Mortgage Bonds due in May 2018. The context says that Entergy Gulf States Louisiana issued $375 million of these bonds in May 2008. The interest rate is 6.00%. \n\nSo, annual interest expense is typically calculated by multiplying the principal amount by the interest rate. Let me check if there are any other factors mentioned here. The bonds were issued in 2008, and they're due in 2018, so the term is 10 years. But the question is about the annual interest expense, not the total over the period.\n\nThe principal is $375 million, and the rate is 6%. So 375 million times 6% would be 22.5 million per year. Wait, but the context mentions that the proceeds were used to pay off other bonds. However, once these new bonds are issued, the interest expense would be based on their own terms. The previous bonds (3.6% and floating rate) are no longer outstanding after being paid off, so they don't affect the current calculation.\n\nIs there any mention of discounts or premiums on the bonds that might affect the interest expense? The context doesn't mention any discounts or premiums, so I think we can assume it's a straightforward calculation. Also, the answer is asked for in millions, so $22.5 million annually. The answer should be 22.5 million. Let me double-check the numbers again. 375 million times 0.06 equals 22.5. Yep, that seems right. The other details about the company's sources of capital and their credit facility don't seem relevant here. The key numbers are the $375 million at 6%.\n</think>\n\nThe annual interest expense for the 6.00% Series First Mortgage Bonds due May 2018 is calculated by multiplying the principal amount ($375 million) by the interest rate (6.00%). \n\n**Calculation:**  \n$375 million \u00d7 6.00% = $22.5 million  \n\n**Answer:** 22.5 million.",

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking by what percentage the average price of WTI crude oil increased from 2011 to 2013. I need to figure this out based on the provided context.\n\nFirst, I should look at the context given. There's a table with data for WTI crude oil prices for the years 2011, 2012, and 2013. The rows are labeled \"wti crude oil ( dollars per bbl )\" and the columns are the years. The values are $98.05 for 2013, $94.15 for 2012, and $95.11 for 2011. Wait, hold on, the years are listed as 2013, 2012, 2011 in the columns. Let me check again. The first row is [\"benchmark\", \"2013\", \"2012\", \"2011\"], then the next rows have the data. So for WTI, the 2011 value is $95.11, 2012 is $94.15, and 2013 is $98.05. \n\nSo the question is from 2011 to 2013. The starting value is 2011's $95.11 and ending at 2013's $98.05. To find the percentage increase, the formula is ((New Value - Old Value)/Old Value) * 100. \n\nLet me plug in the numbers. New Value is 98.05, Old Value is 95.11. Subtracting gives 98.05 - 95.11 = 2.94. Then divide by 95.11: 2.94 / 95.11 \u2248 0.0309. Multiply by 100 to get percentage: 0.0309 * 100 \u2248 3.09%. \n\nSo the increase is approximately 3.09%.

Let me look at the context provided.\n\nFirst, the context has a table with different categories. The first row shows \"total reserves\" but no number. Then there's \"gross\" with some footnotes, and under that, \"direct\" is $271, \"assumed reinsurance\" $39, \"London market\" $57, and \"total\" $367.

How much of that is from London market? The London market is part of the gross. The gross London market is $57. But when they cede reserves, does that affect London market specifically?
