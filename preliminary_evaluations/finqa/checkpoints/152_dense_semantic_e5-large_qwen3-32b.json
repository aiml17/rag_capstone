      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking for the value of rent expense and certain office equipment expense under lease agreements between 2013 and 2015. The context provided mentions the rent expenses for those years.\n\nLooking at the context, it says: \"rent expense and certain office equipment expense under lease agreements amounted to $136 million, $132 million and $137 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\"\n\nWait, the order here is 2015, 2014, 2013. Let me parse that correctly. The numbers are listed as 2015: $136M, 2014: $132M, 2013: $137M. So for the years 2013 to 2015, each year's expense is given. The question is asking for the total between 2013 and 2015. So I need to add up the three years: 2013 ($137M) + 2014 ($132M) + 2015 ($136M). Let me check the numbers again to make sure I didn't mix them up. The sentence says \"in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\" Wait, the order is 2015, 2014, 2013. So the first number is 2015: $136M, then 2014: $132M, then 2013: $137M. So adding them up: 136 + 132 + 137. Let me calculate that. 136 + 132 is 268, plus 137 is 405. So the total would be $405 million. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other information in the context that might affect this.

The context provided has a table with fiscal years and the corresponding payments.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which years fall into the \"next 12 months\" from the reference date. The reference date here isn't explicitly stated, but the context mentions May 31, 2013. So, the next 12 months would be from June 1, 2013, to May 31, 2014. \n\nLooking at the table, the first year listed is 2014, which ends on May 31. That means the payments for 2014 would be due within the next 12 months from May 31, 2013. The amount for 2014 is $11,057. \n\nWait, but sometimes \"next 12 months\" can be interpreted as the upcoming calendar year. However, since the fiscal years here end on May 31, the next fiscal year after May 31, 2013, is the fiscal year ending May 31, 2014. So, the entire 2014 fiscal year's payments would be due within the next 12 months. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be the amount listed under 2014, which is $11,057.

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking for the percent change in principal transactions revenue associated with interest rate risks from 2016 to 2017. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the table provided. The rows are different types of risks, and the columns are the years 2018, 2017, 2016. The first row is in millions of dollars, which I guess is just the units. The second row is interest rate risks (1), and the numbers are $5186 for 2018, $5301 for 2017, and $4229 for 2016. Wait, the question is from 2016 to 2017, so I need the values for those two years.\n\nSo, the 2016 value is $4229 million and the 2017 value is $5301 million. The percent change formula is ((New Value - Old Value)/Old Value) * 100. Here, the old value is 2016's number, and the new value is 2017's. \n\nLet me calculate the difference first: 5301 - 4229 = 1072. Then divide that by the old value (4229). So 1072 / 4229. Let me do that division. Let me approximate. 4229 times 0.25 is 1057.25. So 1072 is a bit more than that. The difference between 1072 and 1057.25 is 14.75. So 0.25 + (14.75 / 4229). Wait, maybe I should just do the division properly. \n\nLet me use a calculator approach here. 1072 divided by 4229. Let me see. 4229 goes into 1072 how many times? Well, since 4229 is larger than 1072, I need to compute 1072 / 4229. Let me invert that. Let me approximate. Let's divide numerator and denominator by",

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out the annual interest expense for the 6% Series First Mortgage Bonds due May 2018. The context says that Entergy Gulf States Louisiana issued $375 million of these bonds in May 2008. The interest rate is 6.00%. \n\nSo, annual interest expense is typically calculated by multiplying the principal amount by the interest rate. Let me check if there are any other factors here. The bonds were issued in May 2008 and mature in May 2018, so the question is about the annual expense each year. Since it's a 10-year bond, each year they'd pay 6% of $375 million.\n\nCalculating that: 375,000,000 * 0.06 = 22,500,000. So that's $22.5 million per year. \n\nWait, but the question is asking for the annual interest expense related to this series. The context doesn't mention any other details that would affect the interest expense, like discounts or premiums on the bonds. The 6% seems straightforward. Also, the other information about paying off previous bonds and the applications for issuing other securities don't seem relevant to calculating the interest on the 2018 bonds. \n\nSo the answer should be $22.5 million. Let me double-check the numbers. 375 million times 6% is indeed 22.5 million. The answer needs to be in millions, so 22.5 is correct. The other data points in the context, like the $325 million and $350 million bonds, are about different series and have been paid off by Entergy Texas, so they don't affect this calculation. \n\nTherefore, the annual interest expense for the 6% series due May 2018 is $22.5 million.\n</think>\n\nThe annual interest expense for the 6.00% Series First Mortgage Bonds due May 2018 is calculated by multiplying the principal amount ($375 million) by the interest rate (6.00%). \n\n**Calculation:**  \n$375,000,000 \u00d7 6.00% = $22,500,000.\n\n**Answer:**",

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking by what percentage the average price of WTI crude oil increased from 2011 to 2013. I need to figure this out based on the provided context.\n\nFirst, I should look at the data given. The context includes a table with benchmark prices for different years. The WTI crude oil prices are listed as $98.05 in 2013, $94.15 in 2012, and $95.11 in 2011. Wait, so 2011's price is $95.11 and 2013's is $98.05. The question is about the increase from 2011 to 2013. \n\nTo calculate the percentage increase, the formula is ((New Value - Old Value)/Old Value) * 100. So here, the old value is 2011's price, which is $95.11, and the new value is 2013's price, $98.05. \n\nLet me do the subtraction first: 98.05 minus 95.11. That gives 2.94 dollars. Then divide that by the old value: 2.94 / 95.11. Let me calculate that. Let's see, 2.94 divided by 95.11. Hmm, approximately 0.0309. Multiply by 100 to get the percentage: about 3.09%. \n\nWait, let me check the numbers again to make sure I didn't mix up the years. The 2011 price is definitely $95.11, and 2013 is $98.05. So yes, the difference is correct. So the percentage increase is roughly 3.09%. The question probably expects rounding, maybe to one decimal place, so 3.1%. But maybe they want it as a whole number? Let me verify the calculation again.\n\nCalculating 2.94 divided by 95.11. Let me do this more accurately. Let's convert it to decimal. 95.11 times 1.03 is 95.11 +",

The question is about the change between these two years. \n\nTo find the change, I should subtract the 2013 value from the 2014 value. So, 8368 minus 7874. Let me do that calculation. \n\n8368 - 7874 equals... let's see. 8000 minus 7874 is 126, and then add the remaining 368 from 8368. Wait, maybe breaking it down differently: 7874 + 494 = 8368? Let me check again. 7874 + 494: 7874 + 400 is 8274, plus 94 is 8368. Yes, that's right. So the difference is 494 million. \n\nBut wait, the question is about the change in liability.

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking what portion of the total net reserves is related to the London Market. Let me look at the context provided.\n\nFirst, there's a table with different categories. The first row has \"total reserves\", but then there's a breakdown under \"gross\" into direct, assumed reinsurance, London market, and total. The numbers are in dollars. Direct is $271, assumed reinsurance is $39, London market is $57, and total gross is $367. Then there's ceded at -47 (which I think is subtracted), leading to net of $320.\n\nSo the total net reserves are $320. The question is about the portion related to London Market. From the gross breakdown, London Market is $57. But wait, does the ceded amount affect London Market specifically? The ceded is listed as -47, which is subtracted from the total gross to get net. But the ceded might be a total cession across all categories, not just London Market. The problem is, the context doesn't specify how much of the ceded is from London Market. \n\nAssuming that the ceded amount is a total, and the London Market's portion in net would be its gross amount minus any cessions related to it. But since there's no specific info on how the ceded is split between direct, assumed reinsurance, and London market, maybe we have to assume that the ceded is applied proportionally or that London Market's cession is zero? Wait, the ceded is listed as \"-47 (47)\" which might be the total ceded for all. The table shows that gross total is 367, ceded 47, net 320. The London Market's gross is 57. If there's no specific info on cessions for London Market, perhaps the net for London Market is just 57, and the ceded is part of the overall cessions. But that might not be accurate. Alternatively, maybe the ceded is only related to certain parts.
