The question is asking for the total between 2013 and 2015. Let me check the years again. The years mentioned are 2013, 2014, and 2015. The values are 137, 132, and 136 million dollars respectively. \n\nWait, the order in the context is 2015, 2014, 2013. Let me make sure I have them right. The sentence says \"$136 million, $132 million and $137 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\" So:\n\n2013: $137 million\n\n2014: $132 million\n\n2015: $136 million\n\nSo the total from 2013 to 2015 would be 137 + 132 + 136. Let me add those up.\n\n137 + 132 is 269. Then 269 + 136 is 405. So the total is $405 million. \n\nI need to confirm that the question is asking for all three years. The question says \"between 2013 and 2015,\" which typically includes all years in that range, so 2013, 2014, and 2015. So adding all three amounts gives the correct total. \n\nI don't see any other numbers related to rent expense in the context, so I think that's all. The answer should be 405 million dollars.\n</think>\n\nThe value of rent expense and certain office equipment",

The context provided includes a list of future payments by fiscal year.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out which years fall within the next 12 months from May 31, 2013. The next fiscal year listed is 2014, which ends on May 31, 2014. But the question is about the next 12 months from May 31, 2013. So, the next 12 months would be from June 1, 2013, to May 31, 2014. That means the entire 2014 fiscal year's payments would be due within that period. \n\nLooking at the data, the 2014 payment is $11,057. The other years (2015 onwards) are beyond the next 12 months. The \"thereafter\" category is for payments after 2018, which is even further out. So the answer should be the 2014 amount. \n\nWait, but I need to confirm if the fiscal years are aligned with calendar years. The context says \"fiscal years ending May 31,\" so each fiscal year is from June 1 to May 31. So the 2014 fiscal year is June 1, 2013, to May 31, 2014. Therefore, the entire $11,057 for 2014 is due within the next 12 months from May 31, 2013. \n\nNo other years are within the next 12 months. The next one is 2015, which starts after May 31, 2014.

The context provided includes a table with the numbers for collateral posted in those years.\n\nFirst, I need to locate the correct numbers. The table has rows for \"collateral posted\" with values for 2012 and 2011. From the table, the collateral posted in December 2012 is 24,296 million and in December 2011 it's 29,002 million. \n\nTo calculate the percentage change, the formula is ((New Value - Old Value) / Old Value) * 100. Here, the new value is 2012's collateral, and the old value is 2011's. \n\nSo subtracting 29,002 from 24,296 gives a difference of -4,706. Dividing that by 29,002 gives approximately -0.1623. Multiplying by 100 gives -16.23%. \n\nWait, but percentage change can be a negative number if it's a decrease. The answer should reflect that it decreased by about 16.23%. Let me double-check the numbers to make sure I didn't mix up the years. The 2012 value is indeed lower than 2011, so the negative sign indicates a decrease. \n\nI think that's all. The user probably wants the absolute value of the percentage change, but since the question is about percentage change, the negative sign is appropriate here to show a decrease. Let me confirm the calculation once more. Yes, 24,296 minus 29,002 is -4,706. Divided by 29,002 equals roughly -0.1623, so -16.23%. Rounded to two decimal places, that's -16.23%. Alternatively, sometimes percentage changes are presented as absolute values with a note on increase/decrease, but the question just asks for the percentage change, so the negative sign is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe percentage change in collateral posted between 2011 and 2012 is calculated as follows:  \n\n**Collateral posted in",

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out the answer to the question: \"What portion of the total bankruptcy settlement obligations are related to labor deemed claims?\" \n\nFirst, I need to look at the context provided. The context mentions several numbers related to bankruptcy settlement obligations as of December 31, 2013. \n\nThe first part says that the fair value based on the expected number of shares to be distributed to satisfy the deemed claim was approximately $1.7 billion. Then, on the effective date, there was an initial distribution of $595 million in common stock and American paid $300 million in cash for payroll taxes. As of December 31, 2013, the remaining liability to labor groups and employees was $849 million. \n\nSo, the total obligations related to labor deemed claims would be the sum of what's already been distributed and the remaining liability. Wait, but the question is asking for the portion related to labor deemed claims. Let me check the numbers again.\n\nThe initial distribution was $595 million (stock) plus $300 million (cash), which totals $895 million. Then there's a remaining liability of $849 million. But wait, the $1.7 billion is mentioned as the fair value based on expected shares. Maybe the total labor deemed claims are the initial distributions plus the remaining liability? Let me see:\n\nIf the initial distribution was $595M stock + $300M cash = $895M, and the remaining liability is $849M, then total would be $895M + $849M = $1,744M. But the first sentence says the fair value was approximately $1.7 billion. That's close to $1.744 billion. Maybe the $1.7B is the total, and the $849M is part of that. \n\nWait, the context says \"the fair value based on the expected number of shares to be distributed to satisfy this deemed claim was approximately $1.7 billion.\" Then later, they made an initial distribution of $595M stock and $300M cash. The remaining liability is $849M. So the total labor deemed claims would be the initial distributions plus the remaining liability. But the initial distributions were $595M + $300",
