The context mentions an event called the Victoria Symphony Splash, which includes live cannon fire during the 1812 Overture. The 1812 Overture is a musical piece by Tchaikovsky that commemorates Russia's defense against Napoleon's invasion in 1812. So the musical piece in question here is the 1812 Overture.\n\nNow, the context states that the event is produced by the Victoria Symphony and led by their Music Director, Tania Miller. The event includes live cannon fire during the 1812 Overture. The question is about who conducts the cannon firing. However, the term \"conduct\" here might be a bit ambiguous. In a musical context, conducting refers to leading the orchestra, which is done by Tania Miller. But the cannon firing is part of the event during the overture. \n\nThe context doesn't explicitly mention who is responsible for firing the cannons. It just says that there's a large fireworks display and live cannon fire during the 1812 Overture. The conductor of the symphony is Tania Miller, but the actual firing of cannons would likely be handled by a separate team or crew, possibly part of the event's production. However, the question might be tricking us into thinking it's the conductor of the musical piece. Since the cannons are part of the performance of the 1812 Overture, and the overture is conducted by Tania Miller, maybe the answer is her. But the question says \"conduct the firing cannons,\" which is a physical action, not a musical conducting role. \n\nWait, but in some performances of the 1812 Overture, the cannon fire is synchronized with the music. The conductor might coordinate with the cannon crew to time the explosions with the music. However, the context doesn't specify who is in charge of the cannons. The only person mentioned as leading the event is Tania Miller, the Music Director. Since the cannons are part of the event during her concert, perhaps the answer is Tania Miller.

        "In the Gribeauval era, the 4-pounder was the lightest weight cannon of the French field artillery; the others were the medium Canon de 8 Gribeauval and the heavy Canon de 12 Gribeauval. The Gribeauval system was introduced in 1765 and the guns were first employed during the American Revolutionary War. The most large-scale use of Gribeauval guns occurred during the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars. At first a pair of 4-pounders were assigned to each infantry battalion and were often called battalion pieces. Later, Emperor Napoleon took the guns away from the infantry units and began to replace the 4-pounder with the 6-pounder, using captured guns as well as newly cast French cannons."

The context provided mentions the Stolperstein project. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what a Stolperstein is. From the context, it's a cobblestone-sized concrete cube with a brass plate inscribed with names and dates of Nazi victims. The project was initiated by Gunter Demnig in 1992. But the question is about an American public affairs campaigner involved in this.\n\nLooking through the context again, there's mention of Terry Swartzberg. He's an American PA campaigner and journalist based in Munich. He's known for his work with the Stolpersteine project. The other person mentioned is Geoffrey Morrell, but he's a public affairs official in the US Department of Defense and later at BP, so probably not relevant here.\n\nSo the answer should be Stolperstein, designed by Terry Swartzberg. Wait, but the Stolperstein was initiated by Gunter Demnig. However, the question says \"designed by an American public affairs campaigner.\" The context says Terry Swartzberg contributed to the project. Maybe he designed a specific type or was involved in the design? Or perhaps the question is phrased in a way that the answer is Stolperstein, and the American involved is Swartzberg. The question might be a bit tricky here. The actual designer is Demnig, but the American campaigner associated with it is Swartzberg. The question might be asking for the name of the stone cube, which is Stolperstein, and the American involved is Swartzberg. So the answer is Stolperstein.\n</think>\n\nThe stone cube referred to as \"stumbling stone\" is the **Stolperstein**, a cobblestone-sized memorial designed as part of a decentralized Holocaust commemoration project.
