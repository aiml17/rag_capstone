The question is asking who a new permanent member on the fourteenth season of So You Think You Can Dance played in High School Musical. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the new permanent member of the show's panel for that season. From the context provided, the fourteenth season's judges include Nigel Lythgoe, Mary Murphy, and a new permanent member, Vanessa Hudgens. The host is Cat Deeley. So Vanessa Hudgens is the new judge added for that season.\n\nNow, the next part is figuring out which role Vanessa Hudgens played in High School Musical. The context mentions that she portrayed Gabriella Montez in the High School Musical film series. That's her main role in the movies. The question is specifically about the role she played in High School Musical, so the answer should be Gabriella Montez.\n\nLet me double-check to make sure there's no confusion. The context states: \"Hudgens rose to prominence portraying Gabriella Montez in the 'High School Musical' film series...\" So yes, that's her character. The new judge is Vanessa Hudgens, and her character in High School Musical is Gabriella Montez.

The question is asking who will conduct the firing cannons in Victoria as part of a musical piece written to celebrate the defeat of Napoleon in Russia. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the context provided. The context mentions the Victoria Symphony Splash event, which includes live cannon fire during the 1812 Overture. The 1812 Overture is a musical piece by Tchaikovsky that commemorates Russia's defense against Napoleon's invasion in 1812. So the musical piece in question here is the 1812 Overture.\n\nNow, the event is produced by the Victoria Symphony and led by their Music Director, Tania Miller. The context states that during this event, there's a large fireworks display and live cannon fire during the 1812 Overture. The question is about who conducts the firing of the cannons. However, in the context, it's mentioned that the concert is led by Tania Miller. But does she conduct the cannons, or is there someone else?\n\nWait, the term \"conduct\" here might be a bit tricky. In a musical context, conducting refers to leading the orchestra, which Tania Miller does as the Music Director. The cannon fire is part of the performance, synchronized with the 1812 Overture. However, the actual firing of cannons would typically be handled by a separate team or crew, not necessarily the conductor of the orchestra. But the question is phrased as \"who will conduct the firing cannons,\" which might be using \"conduct\" in the sense of directing or coordinating the cannon fire as part of the musical piece.\n\nBut the context doesn't mention any specific person responsible for the cannon fire. It only mentions Tania Miller as the conductor of the symphony. Since the cannons are part of the event's production, maybe the conductor of the symphony (Tania Miller) is the one who coordinates the timing of the cannons with the music. Therefore, even though she isn't physically firing the cannons, she would be conducting the overall performance, including the cannon fire as part of the 1812 Overture. \n\nAlternatively, if there's a specific person in charge of the pyrotechnics and cannons, the context doesn't provide that information.

The user is asking about a stone cube that means \"stumbling stone\" and was designed by an American public affairs campaigner. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the context provided. The context mentions \"Stolperstein\" which translates to \"stumbling stone.\" It's a cobblestone-sized concrete cube with a brass plate inscribed with names of victims of Nazi persecution. The project was initiated by Gunter Demnig, a German artist, in 1992. \n\nNow, the question is about an American public affairs campaigner involved in this. Looking at the context, Terry Swartzberg is mentioned as an American PA campaigner and journalist based in Munich. He's known for his work with the Stolpersteine project. However, the project itself was started by Gunter Demnig, not Swartzberg. The question says \"designed by,\" but Swartzberg's role is more about contributing to the project, not designing the stone itself.\n\nWait, the question might be tricky. The stone cube is called Stolperstein, designed by Demnig. But the American involved here is Terry Swartzberg. However, the question says \"designed by an American public affairs campaigner.\" But according to the context, Demnig is the initiator. So maybe there's confusion here. Let me check again.\n\nThe context states: \"The 'stolperstein' art project was initiated by the German artist Gunter Demnig in 1992...\" So the design is his. Terry Swartzberg is involved in the project but not the designer. The question might be incorrect, or perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the answer is Stolperstein, even though the designer is German, but the American campaigner is associated with it. But the question specifically asks for the stone cube designed by the American. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the answer is still Stolperstein, because the question is phrased as \"designed by an American public affairs campaigner,\" but according to the context, Terry Swartzberg is involved in the project but not the designer. So perhaps the question is incorrect, or there's a trick here. Alternatively, maybe the answer is Stolperstein, as that's the stone cube, and the American is associated with it, even if not the original designer. But the user is asking for",

The second mention is about John Tardy born March 15, 1968, who is a vocalist for the death metal band Obituary and Tardy Brothers. His brother is Donald Tardy, the drummer of Obituary.
