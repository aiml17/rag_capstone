The question is asking about the youngest male model ever to participate in Seoul Fashion Week, who stars with Park Hae-jin and Kang So-ra in a TV series, and we need to find out the date it last aired.\n\nFirst, looking at the context provided. The first sentence says, \"He debuted in 2005 as a runway model, becoming the youngest male model ever to participate in Seoul Fashion Week.\" Then it mentions Lee Jong-suk, born in 1989, as a South Korean actor and model. \n\nFurther down, there's information about a TV series called \"Doctor Stranger\" from 2014, which stars Lee Jong-suk, Jin Se-yeon, Park Hae-jin, and Kang So-ra.

Therefore, the answer should be July 8, 2014. Let me double-check if there's any other information that might conflict.

His first novel was \"Call for the Dead\" in 1961, which introduced George Smiley. So he's also a novelist. The context also notes that after the success of his first novel, he left MI6 to become a full-time author. So both of them are novelists. The answer should be yes.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: Yes, both John le Carr\u00e9 and Tim Winton are novelists. Tim Winton is an Australian writer known for novels, children's books, non-fiction, and short stories. John le Carr\u00e9, a British author, is renowned for his espionage novels, including his debut *Call for the Dead*, which introduced the character George Smiley.",

      "ground_truth_answer": "The former American football player who had a part in the movie \"Gamer\" is Terry Alan Crews.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out which former American football player was in the movie \"Gamer.\" The context provided has a few sentences that might help.\n\nFirst, the context mentions \"Gamer is a 2009 American science fiction action film...\" and lists some actors: Gerard Butler, Logan Lerman, and Michael C. Then there are two names given with birth dates: Terry Alan Crews and Ainsley Thomas Battles, both former American football players.\n\nThe question is asking which of these former players had a part in \"Gamer.\" The key here is to check if either Terry Crews or Ainsley Battles are mentioned in the context as being in the movie. \n\nLooking at the context again, the movie's cast includes Gerard Butler, Logan Lerman, and Michael C. The other two names, Terry Crews and Ainsley Battles, are listed as former football players but aren't mentioned in the movie's cast. Wait, maybe I missed something. Let me read again.\n\nThe context says: \"The film stars Gerard Butler... and Logan Lerman... it also stars Michael C.\" Then it lists Terry Crews and Ainsley Battles with their birth dates. There's no direct mention of them being in the movie. But maybe the answer is Terry Crews because he's a well-known actor who transitioned from football to acting. However, the context doesn't explicitly say he was in \"Gamer.\" Hmm.\n\nWait, the context might be a bit confusing. The first sentence mentions someone resigning as DB Coach to move to Las Vegas. Then it jumps to the movie \"Gamer,\" then talks about someone playing football at Vanderbilt and being an NFL safety. Then the movie's stars, then Terry Crews and Ainsley Battles. \n\nIs there any connection between the movie and these two? The answer might be Terry Crews because he's a former NFL player and an actor. But does the context say he was in \"Gamer\"? The context lists him as an actor and former football player but doesn't explicitly state he was in the movie. However, the question is based on the provided context. Since the context mentions both Terry Crews and Ainsley Battles as former players, but only Terry Crews is known for acting, maybe the answer is Terry Crews. But the context doesn't explicitly link him to the movie. Wait, the movie's cast includes Michael C., which might be Michael C",

The question is asking which British multinational retailer Archie Norman will succeed Robert Swannell as chairman of, and it's headquartered in Westminster, London.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the context provided. The context mentions Marks and Spencer plc (M&S) as a major British multinational retailer headquartered in the City of Westminster, London. Then there's Archibald John Norman, known as Archie Norman, who is a businessman and politician. The context also states that he will succeed Robert Swannell as chairman of Marks & Spencer in September 2017. \n\nOther companies mentioned are Debenhams plc, but the question is about the one headquartered in Westminster. Since M&S is explicitly stated to be headquartered there, and the succession is mentioned for M&S, the answer should be Marks and Spencer. The other details about Debenhams are probably there to distract. Let me double-check: the question specifies the headquarters in Westminster, which matches M&S.
