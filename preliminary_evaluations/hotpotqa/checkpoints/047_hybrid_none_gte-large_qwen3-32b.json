The question is asking who will conduct the firing cannons in Victoria as part of a musical piece written to celebrate the defeat of Napoleon in Russia. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the context provided. Let me start by breaking down the information given.\n\nThe first part talks about Bart\u00f3k's Sonata for Two Pianos and Percussion. It mentions the premiere dates and locations, but I don't think this is directly relevant to the question. The question is about cannons being fired during a musical piece related to Napoleon's defeat in Russia.\n\nThe second part is about the 1812 Overture by Tchaikovsky. The context says it's an overture written in 1880 to commemorate Russia's defense against Napoleon's invasion in 1812. That seems relevant because the question mentions a musical piece celebrating the defeat of Napoleon in Russia. The 1812 Overture is definitely that piece.\n\nThen there's information about the Canon de 4 Gribeauval, which is a French cannon used in historical battles, including the Napoleonic Wars. But again, not sure how this connects yet. The cannons mentioned here are historical, but the question is about a modern event.\n\nThe last part is about the Victoria Symphony Splash event. It's an annual event in Victoria, BC, where the Victoria Symphony plays live on a barge in the Inner Harbour. The event includes fireworks and live cannon fire during the 1812 Overture. The concert is led by Tania Miller, the Music Director. The 2016 event was the 27th one.\n\nSo putting it all together: The musical piece in question is the 1812 Overture by Tchaikovsky, which celebrates Russia's defense against Napoleon. The Victoria Symphony Splash includes cannon fire during this overture. The question is asking who will conduct the firing of the cannons during this event. However, the context doesn't mention a specific person responsible for conducting the cannon fire. It mentions Tania Miller as the concert's leader, but she's the music director conducting the symphony. The cannon fire is part of the event, but the context doesn't specify who physically fires the cannons or if there's a person conducting that. \n\nWait, the question says \"conduct the firing cannons.\" In orchestral terms, \"conduct\" usually refers to the conductor.

        "The Sonata for Two Pianos and Percussion, Sz. 110, BB 115 is a musical piece written by Hungarian composer B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k in 1937. It was premiered by him and his second wife, Ditta P\u00e1sztory-Bart\u00f3k, with the percussionists Fritz Schiesser and Philipp R\u00fchlig at the International Society for Contemporary Music (ISCM) anniversary concert of 16 January 1938 in Basel, Switzerland, where it received enthusiastic reviews. Bart\u00f3k and his wife also played the piano parts for the American premiere which took place in New York City's Town Hall in 1940, with the percussionists Saul Goodman and Henry Deneke. It has since become one of Bart\u00f3k's most performed works.\n\nThe Year 1812, festival overture in E\u266d major, Op. 49, popularly known as the 1812 Overture, is an overture written in 1880 by Russian composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky to commemorate Russia's defence of its motherland against Napoleon's invading Grande Arm\u00e9e in 1812.\n\nThe Canon de 4 Gribeauval or 4-pounder was a French cannon and part of the artillery system developed by Jean Baptiste Vaquette de Gribeauval. The Old French pound (French: livre) was 1.079 English pounds, making the weight of shot about 4.3 English pounds. In the Gribeauval era, the 4-pounder was the lightest weight cannon of the French field artillery; the others were the medium Canon de 8 Gribeauval and the heavy Canon de 12 Gribeauval. The Gribeauval system was introduced in 1765 and the guns were first employed during the American Revolutionary War. The most large-scale use of Gribeauval guns occurred during the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars. At first a pair of 4-pounders were assigned to each infantry battalion and were often called battalion pieces. Later, Emperor Napoleon took the guns away from the infantry units and began to replace the 4-pounder with the 6-pounder, using captured guns as well as newly cast French cannons. However, as the French infantry declined in quality after 1809, the 4-pounders were reintroduced in order to provide direct support for formations of foot soldiers. All Gribeauval cannons were capable of firing canister shot at close-range and round shot at long-range targets. The Gribeauval system supplanted the older Valli\u00e8re system, was partly replaced by the Year XI system in 1803 and completely superseded by the Val\u00e9e system in 1829.\n\nVictoria Symphony Splash is an annual event held in Victoria, British Columbia on the Sunday before BC Day. The event is produced by the Victoria Symphony and consists of the Victoria Symphony playing, live on a barge, in the middle of Victoria's Inner Harbour. Also included in the event is a very large fireworks display, as well as live cannon fire, during the 1812 Overture. The concert is led by Victoria Symphony Music Director Tania Miller. The 2016 event on July 31 will be the 27th Victoria Symphony Splash."
