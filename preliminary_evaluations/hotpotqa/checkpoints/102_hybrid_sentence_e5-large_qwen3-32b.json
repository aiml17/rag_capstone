The question is asking who a new permanent member on the fourteenth season of So You Think You Can Dance played in High School Musical. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the new permanent member of the show's panel for season 14.

The context repeats that Hudgens played Gabriella Montez, and that's her prominent role. The question is specifically about the character she played in High School Musical, which is Gabriella. The fact that she's a new judge on SYTYCD season 14 is just the context for the question, but the answer lies in her role in High School Musical.\n</think>\n\nThe new permanent member on the fourteenth season of *So You Think You Can Dance* is Vanessa Hudgens.

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking about a stone cube that means \"stumbling stone,\" designed by an American public affairs campaigner. The context provided talks about the Stolperstein project. \n\nFirst, I need to connect the terms. The Stolperstein is described as a cobblestone-sized concrete cube with a brass plate. The project was initiated by Gunter Demnig, but the question mentions an American public affairs campaigner. Looking through the context, Terry Swartzberg is mentioned as an American PA campaigner and journalist who worked for the Stolpersteine project. \n\nSo, the stone cube in question is the Stolperstein. The key points here are that the Stolperstein is the \"stumbling stone,\" and Terry Swartzberg is the American involved. Even though Gunter Demnig started the project, the question is pointing towards the person associated with it in the context given. The answer should be Stolperstein, and the designer in the context is Terry Swartzberg, but the original designer is Gunter Demnig. Wait, the question says \"designed by an American public affairs campaigner.\" The project was initiated by Gunter Demnig, who is German, but Terry Swartzberg is the American involved. However, the actual design of the Stolperstein is the concrete cube with brass plate. The question might be a bit tricky here. The answer is Stolperstein, and the American is Terry Swartzberg. The question is phrased as \"designed by an American...\" but the actual designer is Demnig. However, maybe the question is referring to the person mentioned in the context, which is Terry Swartzberg. But he's a campaigner for the project, not the designer. Hmm. The answer is Stolperstein. The stone cube is called Stolperstein, and the American mentioned is Terry Swartzberg, who worked for the project. The question might be testing if you can extract that the stone is Stolperstein and that Terry is the American involved. So the answer is Stolperstein.\n</think>\n\nThe stone cube referred to as \"stumbling stone\" is the **Stolperstein**, a cobblestone-sized concrete cube with a brass plate commemorating victims of Nazi persecution.
