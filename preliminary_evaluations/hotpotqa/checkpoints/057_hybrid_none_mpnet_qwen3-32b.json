The question is asking who the new permanent member on the fourteenth season of So You Think You Can Dance played in High School Musical. \n\nFirst, I need to find out who the new permanent judge was in season 14. From the context provided, it says that the new permanent member is Vanessa Hudgens. The context mentions that in the fourteenth season, the judges are Nigel Lythgoe, Mary Murphy, and Vanessa Hudgens, with Cat Deeley hosting.\n\nNow, I need to connect Vanessa Hudgens to High School Musical. Looking at the context again, it states that Vanessa Hudgens portrayed Gabriella Montez in the High School Musical film series. That's in the paragraph about her discography and her career. So, since she's the new judge, and she played Gabriella Montez, the answer should be Gabriella Montez.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The context says: \"Hudgens rose to prominence portraying Gabriella Montez in the 'High School Musical' film series...\" So yes, that's her role in High School Musical. The question is asking what role the new judge (Vanessa) played in High School Musical. Therefore, the answer is Gabriella Montez.\n</think>\n\nThe new permanent member on the fourteenth season of *So You Think You Can Dance* was Vanessa Hudgens. In the *High School Musical* film series, she portrayed **Gabriella Montez**. \n\n**Answer:** Gabriella Montez.",

        "The Sonata for Two Pianos and Percussion, Sz. 110, BB 115 is a musical piece written by Hungarian composer B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k in 1937. It was premiered by him and his second wife, Ditta P\u00e1sztory-Bart\u00f3k, with the percussionists Fritz Schiesser and Philipp R\u00fchlig at the International Society for Contemporary Music (ISCM) anniversary concert of 16 January 1938 in Basel, Switzerland, where it received enthusiastic reviews. Bart\u00f3k and his wife also played the piano parts for the American premiere which took place in New York City's Town Hall in 1940, with the percussionists Saul Goodman and Henry Deneke. It has since become one of Bart\u00f3k's most performed works.\n\nThe Year 1812, festival overture in E\u266d major, Op. 49, popularly known as the 1812 Overture, is an overture written in 1880 by Russian composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky to commemorate Russia's defence of its motherland against Napoleon's invading Grande Arm\u00e9e in 1812.\n\nThe Canon de 4 Gribeauval or 4-pounder was a French cannon and part of the artillery system developed by Jean Baptiste Vaquette de Gribeauval. The Old French pound (French: livre) was 1.079 English pounds, making the weight of shot about 4.3 English pounds. In the Gribeauval era, the 4-pounder was the lightest weight cannon of the French field artillery; the others were the medium Canon de 8 Gribeauval and the heavy Canon de 12 Gribeauval. The Gribeauval system was introduced in 1765 and the guns were first employed during the American Revolutionary War. The most large-scale use of Gribeauval guns occurred during the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars. At first a pair of 4-pounders were assigned to each infantry battalion and were often called battalion pieces. Later, Emperor Napoleon took the guns away from the infantry units and began to replace the 4-pounder with the 6-pounder, using captured guns as well as newly cast French cannons. However, as the French infantry declined in quality after 1809, the 4-pounders were reintroduced in order to provide direct support for formations of foot soldiers. All Gribeauval cannons were capable of firing canister shot at close-range and round shot at long-range targets. The Gribeauval system supplanted the older Valli\u00e8re system, was partly replaced by the Year XI system in 1803 and completely superseded by the Val\u00e9e system in 1829.\n\nVictoria Symphony Splash is an annual event held in Victoria, British Columbia on the Sunday before BC Day. The event is produced by the Victoria Symphony and consists of the Victoria Symphony playing, live on a barge, in the middle of Victoria's Inner Harbour. Also included in the event is a very large fireworks display, as well as live cannon fire, during the 1812 Overture. The concert is led by Victoria Symphony Music Director Tania Miller. The 2016 event on July 31 will be the 27th Victoria Symphony Splash."
