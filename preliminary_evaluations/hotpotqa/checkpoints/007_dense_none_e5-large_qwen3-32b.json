It was premiered by him and his second wife, Ditta P\u00e1sztory-Bart\u00f3k, with the percussionists Fritz Schiesser and Philipp R\u00fchlig at the International Society for Contemporary Music (ISCM) anniversary concert of 16 January 1938 in Basel, Switzerland, where it received enthusiastic reviews. Bart\u00f3k and his wife also played the piano parts for the American premiere which took place in New York City's Town Hall in 1940, with the percussionists Saul Goodman and Henry Deneke. It has since become one of Bart\u00f3k's most performed works.\n\nThe Year 1812, festival overture in E\u266d major, Op. 49, popularly known as the 1812 Overture, is an overture written in 1880 by Russian composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky to commemorate Russia's defence of its motherland against Napoleon's invading Grande Arm\u00e9e in 1812.\n\nThe Canon de 4 Gribeauval or 4-pounder was a French cannon and part of the artillery system developed by Jean Baptiste Vaquette de Gribeauval. The Old French pound (French: livre) was 1.079 English pounds, making the weight of shot about 4.3 English pounds. In the Gribeauval era, the 4-pounder was the lightest weight cannon of the French field artillery; the others were the medium Canon de 8 Gribeauval and the heavy Canon de 12 Gribeauval. The Gribeauval system was introduced in 1765 and the guns were first employed during the American Revolutionary War. The most large-scale use of Gribeauval guns occurred during the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars. At first a pair of 4-pounders were assigned to each infantry battalion and were often called battalion pieces. Later, Emperor Napoleon took the guns away from the infantry units and began to replace the 4-pounder with the 6-pounder, using captured guns as well as newly cast French cannons. However, as the French infantry declined in quality after 1809, the 4-pounders were reintroduced in order to provide direct support for formations of foot soldiers. All Gribeauval cannons were capable of firing canister shot at close-range and round shot at long-range targets. The Gribeauval system supplanted the older Valli\u00e8re system, was partly replaced by the Year XI system in 1803 and completely superseded by the Val\u00e9e system in 1829.\n\nVictoria Symphony Splash is an annual event held in Victoria, British Columbia on the Sunday before BC Day. The event is produced by the Victoria Symphony and consists of the Victoria Symphony playing, live on a barge, in the middle of Victoria's Inner Harbour.

The question is asking which British multinational retailer Archie Norman will succeed Robert Swannell as chairman of, and it mentions that the company is headquartered in Westminster, London.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the context provided. Let me go through the information again. The context talks about Marks and Spencer plc (M&S), Debenhams plc, and Timpson. \n\nMarks and Spencer is described as a major British multinational retailer headquartered in the City of Westminster, London. It's listed on the London Stock Exchange and part of the FTSE 100. Then there's Debenhams, which is also a department store but based in the UK and Ireland, founded in the 18th century. Timpson is another retailer but specializes in shoe repairs, key cutting, etc., with a lot of outlets in the UK and Ireland.\n\nThen there's the part about Archibald John Norman, known as Archie Norman. He's a British businessman and politician. The key part here is that he was the chairman of ITV plc from 2010 to 2016 and that he will succeed Robert Swannell as chairman of Marks & Spencer in September 2017. \n\nThe question is specifically asking for the name of the company that's headquartered in Westminster, London, which is M&S as per the context. Debenhams is also a retailer but the context doesn't mention their headquarters location explicitly. The context does say that M&S is headquartered in Westminster, so that's the one. \n\nSo putting it all together, the answer should be Marks and Spencer. The key points are the headquarters location and the mention of Norman succeeding Swannell there. The other companies don't fit the headquarters detail. Timpson is based in Manchester, Debenhams' headquarters isn't mentioned, but M&S is clearly stated. Therefore, the answer is Marks and Spencer.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: Marks and Spencer",
