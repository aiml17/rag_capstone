Since the answer is Gabriella Montez, that should be the correct answer. Let me double-check to make sure there's no other character mentioned.

        "The Sonata for Two Pianos and Percussion, Sz. 110, BB 115 is a musical piece written by Hungarian composer B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k in 1937. It was premiered by him and his second wife, Ditta P\u00e1sztory-Bart\u00f3k, with the percussionists Fritz Schiesser and Philipp R\u00fchlig at the International Society for Contemporary Music (ISCM) anniversary concert of 16 January 1938 in Basel, Switzerland, where it received enthusiastic reviews. Bart\u00f3k and his wife also played the piano parts for the American premiere which took place in New York City's Town Hall in 1940, with the percussionists Saul Goodman and Henry Deneke. It has since become one of Bart\u00f3k's most performed works."
