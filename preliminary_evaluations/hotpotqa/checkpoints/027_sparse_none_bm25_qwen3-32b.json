The question is asking who the new permanent member on the fourteenth season of \"So You Think You Can Dance\" played in \"High School Musical.\" \n\nFirst, I need to look at the context provided. The context mentions that in the fourteenth season of \"So You Think You Can Dance,\" which started on June 12, 2017, the judge panel includes Vanessa Hudgens as a new permanent member. \n\nNow, Vanessa Hudgens is known for her role in \"High School Musical.\" The context says she portrayed Gabriella Montez in the \"High School Musical\" film series. So, the answer should be Gabriella Montez.\n\nLet me double-check. The context clearly states that Vanessa Hudgens played Gabriella Montez in the High School Musical films. The new judge on the show is Vanessa Hudgens, so the character she played is Gabriella Montez. That seems correct. No other characters are mentioned in the context related to her role in High School Musical. Yep, that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe new permanent member on the fourteenth season of *So You Think You Can Dance* was Vanessa Hudgens. In *High School Musical*, she portrayed the character **Gabriella Montez**. \n\n**Answer:** Gabriella Montez.",

The question is asking for the name of a Minahasa journalist and novelist who was active in the colonies that were incorporated into the Dutch government in 1800. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the context provided. The context mentions the Dutch East Indies, which was a Dutch colony formed from the nationalized colonies of the Dutch East India Company under the Dutch government in 1800. So the colonies in question here are the Dutch East Indies.\n\nThen, looking further into the context, there's a mention of Frederick D. J. Pangemanann, also known as Pangemanan, who was a Minahasa journalist and novelist active in the Dutch East Indies. The Dutch East Indies is now Indonesia. Since the Dutch East Indies became a colony under the Dutch government in 1800, Frederick Pangemanann would have been active there during that time.\n\nSo putting it all together, the answer should be Frederick D. J. Pangemanann.

So, John Tardy is from the United States.\n\nNow, Stza is mentioned as Scott Sturgeon, also known as Stza Crack, born on March 4, 1976. He is a musician in the New York City area, fronting ska-punk bands like Choking Victim and Left\u00f6ver Crack. The context says he's from the New York City area, which is in the United States. Therefore, Stza is also American.\n\nSo both John Tardy and Stza are American. The answer should be yes, they are from the same country, the United States. I need to check if there's any conflicting information. The context doesn't mention any other countries for either of them. The only other Tardy mentioned is Jacque Alexander Tardy, the pirate, but that's a different person and from a different time period. So no conflict there.

First, I need to figure out which virus he identified.\n\nLooking at the context, Robert H. Purcell co-identified the Hepatitis A virus (HAV) in 1973. So the virus in question here is Hepatitis A. Now, I need to recall the symptoms associated with Hepatitis A from the provided context.\n\nThe context mentions that Hepatitis A is a liver infection caused by HAV. It says that many cases have few or no symptoms, especially in young people. When symptoms do occur, they typically last eight weeks and include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, jaundice, fever, and abdominal pain. Also, about 10\u201315% of people might have a recurrence of symptoms within six months. Acute liver failure is a rare occurrence, more common in the elderly.\n\nI need to make sure I'm not mixing up other viruses mentioned here. The golden shiner virus and Zika virus are also discussed, but the question is specifically about Robert Purcell's identified virus, which is Hepatitis A. The golden shiner virus causes hemorrhagic shock with symptoms like bleeding from eyes and head, but that's a different virus. The Zika vaccine is mentioned, but again, not related to Purcell's work here.\n\nSo the answer should list the symptoms of Hepatitis A as per the context. The key points are the range of symptoms when they occur, the duration, possible recurrence, and the rare acute liver failure. I should present this information clearly and concisely, making sure to attribute it correctly to Hepatitis A.\n</think>\n\nThe symptoms of the Hepatitis A virus (HAV), identified by Robert H.
