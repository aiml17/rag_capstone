      "question": "Is a party\u2019s liability uncapped upon the breach of its obligation in the contract? This also includes uncap liability for a particular type of breach such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality obligation.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the context provided in the Cooperation Agreement, there does not appear to be any uncapped liability for a party's breach of the contract. The agreement does not explicitly state that a party's liability is uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.\n\nThe relevant sections are:\n\n1. Clause 5 on Confidential Information, which states that the obligations of confidentiality shall remain in force until the relevant information enters the public domain otherwise than by the default of a party. This suggests there is no uncapped liability for breach of the confidentiality obligation.\n\n2. Clause 4.1 regarding QIWI's obligation to settle transactions through Otkritie's bank. This clause states that if QIWI terminates this obligation, it shall pay a fee to Otkritie, but this fee is capped at RUB 50,000,000. This indicates a cap on liability for breach of this specific obligation.\n\n3. The agreement does not contain any other provisions that suggest uncapped liability for breach of the contract or specific types of breaches. The dispute resolution clause (Clause 9) also does not indicate uncapped damages.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the Cooperation Agreement, the liability of the parties does not appear to be uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.",
      "generated_response": "Based on the excerpts you provided, the agreement contains **no clause that limits or caps liability** for any breach \u2013 whether a general breach, an IP\u2011infringement breach, or a breach of the confidentiality obligations set out in Clause\u202f5.  \n\n- Clause\u202f5 (confidentiality) spells out the parties\u2019 duties and the circumstances in which disclosure is permitted, but it does **not** include any limitation\u2011of\u2011liability provision (e.g., \u201cliability shall be limited to \u00a3X\u201d or \u201cliability shall be limited to direct losses only\u201d).  \n- The surrounding clauses (assignment, third\u2011party rights, governing law) also do not impose any cap on damages.  \n\nIn contract law, when a contract **does not contain a limitation\u2011of\u2011liability clause**, the default position is that a party can be held liable for the full extent of the loss caused by its breach, subject only to the usual common\u2011law and statutory limits (e.g., damages must be a foreseeable consequence of the breach, and punitive damages are generally unavailable under English law).  \n\nTherefore, **under the terms you have shown, a party\u2019s liability appears to be uncapped** for any breach, including breaches of confidentiality or IP\u2011related breaches, unless a separate part of the agreement (not included in the excerpt) introduces a liability cap or limitation.",

      "question": "Is there an exclusive dealing\u00a0 commitment with the counterparty? This includes a commitment to procure all \u201crequirements\u201d from one party of certain technology, goods, or services or a prohibition on licensing or selling technology, goods or services to third parties, or a prohibition on\u00a0 collaborating or working with other parties), whether during the contract or\u00a0 after the contract ends (or both).",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the information provided in the context, there does not appear to be any explicit mention of an exclusive dealing commitment or requirement for the counterparty. The document appears to be an amendment to the \"Section 2, Part B of the Co-Branding Agreement\" between PC Quote, Inc. (PCQ) and A.B. Watley, Inc. (ABW), but it does not contain any details about exclusivity or prohibitions on collaborating with third parties. The document focuses on the term and effective date of the amendment, and it is signed by the representatives of the two companies, but there are no clauses indicating an exclusive dealing arrangement. Without any such provisions explicitly stated, the available information does not suggest the presence of an exclusive dealing commitment in this context.",
      "generated_response": "Based on the excerpts you provided, there is **no explicit language indicating an exclusive\u2011dealing commitment** between the parties.\n\n- The documents shown are a signature page for a co\u2011branding agreement and an amendment to the \u201cTerm\u201d section of that agreement.  \n- Neither the signature page nor the amendment text contains any clause that obligates one party to purchase **all** of its requirements from the other, nor does it prohibit either party from licensing, selling, or collaborating with third parties during or after the agreement.\n\nTherefore, within the scope of the material you shared, there is no evidence of an exclusive\u2011dealing provision. If such a commitment exists, it would have to be found in another part of the agreement that is not included here.",
