      "question": "Is a party\u2019s liability uncapped upon the breach of its obligation in the contract? This also includes uncap liability for a particular type of breach such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality obligation.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the context provided in the Cooperation Agreement, there does not appear to be any uncapped liability for a party's breach of the contract. The agreement does not explicitly state that a party's liability is uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.\n\nThe relevant sections are:\n\n1. Clause 5 on Confidential Information, which states that the obligations of confidentiality shall remain in force until the relevant information enters the public domain otherwise than by the default of a party. This suggests there is no uncapped liability for breach of the confidentiality obligation.\n\n2. Clause 4.1 regarding QIWI's obligation to settle transactions through Otkritie's bank. This clause states that if QIWI terminates this obligation, it shall pay a fee to Otkritie, but this fee is capped at RUB 50,000,000. This indicates a cap on liability for breach of this specific obligation.\n\n3. The agreement does not contain any other provisions that suggest uncapped liability for breach of the contract or specific types of breaches. The dispute resolution clause (Clause 9) also does not indicate uncapped damages.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the Cooperation Agreement, the liability of the parties does not appear to be uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether a party's liability is uncapped if they breach the contract, specifically including IP infringement or confidentiality breaches. The context provided is a confidentiality clause from a contract, specifically clauses 5.1 to 5.4.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the context mentions anything about liability caps or uncapped liability. The main clauses here are about confidentiality obligations and exceptions. The question is about liability being uncapped, which relates to the consequences of breaching these obligations. \n\nLooking through the provided clauses, there's a lot about what the parties can't do with confidential information and exceptions where they can disclose it. However, I don't see any mention of liability limits or exclusions of damages. The clauses outline the obligations and permitted disclosures but don't specify whether the liability is capped or not. \n\nIn contract law, unless there's a specific clause limiting liability, the default is usually that liability isn't capped. But the user is asking if the liability is uncapped here. Since the context doesn't include any language about capping liability, like \"neither party shall be liable for any indirect damages\" or \"liability is limited to a certain amount,\" it's possible that the liability isn't capped. However, the question also mentions specific breaches like IP infringement or confidentiality breaches. The confidentiality clauses here don't mention liability caps either. \n\nBut wait, the user is asking if the liability is uncapped. The answer would depend on whether the contract has any other clauses about liability. Since the provided context only includes confidentiality clauses and not the entire contract, maybe there's a separate liability clause elsewhere. However, the user hasn't provided that. So based solely on the given context, there's no mention of liability caps. Therefore, the answer would be that based on the provided context, there's no indication that the liability is capped. But the user needs to check the entire contract for any liability limitation clauses. \n\nBut the question is specifically about the confidentiality obligations. The answer should be that the context doesn't specify whether liability is capped. Therefore, the default would be that it's not capped unless stated otherwise. However, the user's question is whether it's uncapped. Since the context doesn't mention a cap, the answer would be that liability is not capped here, but the user should check the entire contract for other terms.\n</think>\n\nBased on the provided context, the confidentiality clauses (5",

The context provided includes several clauses from the agreement.\n\nFirst, looking at clause 10: The agreement is in effect until March 18, 2021, unless terminated earlier by either party with 30 days written notice. So the initial term is until March 18, 2021. The question is about what happens after that date if it's not terminated. The user is asking about renewal terms, including automatic extensions or unilateral extensions with prior notice.\n\nBut in the provided context, there's no mention of an automatic renewal clause. Clause 10 says the agreement is effective until March 18, 2021, and can be terminated with 30 days notice. That suggests that if neither party gives notice, the agreement would just end on March 18, 2021, without automatically renewing.

      "question": "Does the contract contain a license grant to a licensee (incl. sublicensor) and the affiliates of such licensee/sublicensor?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "No, the contract does not contain a license grant to a licensee or the affiliates of such licensee. The contract grants Distributor (GLS LLC) a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use and sublicense the Software provided by Airspan, but it does not explicitly grant a license or rights to any affiliates of the Distributor.\n\nSpecifically, Section 11.1 states:\n\n\"Airspan grants Distributor, and Distributor hereby accepts, a nonexclusive, non-transferable license to use, and to sublicense as set forth below, Software provided by Airspan hereunder only on a single System or unit of Equipment, as may be applicable.\"\n\nThere is no mention of affiliates of the Distributor being granted any license or rights to the Software.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the contract contains a license grant to a licensee, including their affiliates. Let me look through the provided context to find relevant sections.\n\nFirst, I remember that in the context, there's a section about the software license. Let me check page 14 again. Section 11.1 says: \"Airspan grants Distributor, and Distributor hereby accepts, a nonexclusive, non-transferable license to use, and to sublicense as set forth below, Software provided by Airspan hereunder only on a single System or unit of Equipment...\" \n\nSo the license is given to the Distributor. The key terms here are \"nonexclusive\" and \"non-transferable.\" Also, it mentions the right to sublicense \"as set forth below,\" but the context doesn't show what's in the \"below\" part. However, the main point is that the Distributor gets a license to use the Software. \n\nNow, the question is about whether the license includes the licensee's affiliates. The license is granted to the Distributor, who is the licensee here. The term \"non-transferable\" usually means that the licensee can't transfer the license to others, including affiliates. But wait, the Distributor is allowed to sublicense \"as set forth below.\" However, the context doesn't specify if sublicensing to affiliates is permitted. \n\nLooking at other parts of the contract, like Section 1.1, it mentions that the Distributor is appointed as an independent distributor and has a license to resell products. But there's no mention of affiliates in the license grant. The license in 11.1 is specifically for the Distributor's use and sublicensing as per the agreement. Since the license is non-transferable, affiliates wouldn't automatically be included unless explicitly stated. \n\nAlso, in Section 10.12, there's a non-compete clause for the Distributor and Airspan, but that's about competition, not licensing. The main license section (11.1) doesn't mention affiliates. Therefore, the license is only for the Distributor, not their affiliates. The answer would be no unless there's an explicit mention of affiliates, which there isn't in the provided context.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: The contract grants a nonexclusive, non-transferable license to the Distributor (the licensee) to use and sublicense Airspan's Software, as outlined in Section",

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out the answer to the question \"The name of the contract\" based on the provided context. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the context given. The context is a legal document, probably an agreement between several parties: the Company, the MHC, the Bank, and the Agent. The first part talks about acceptance of an arrangement and mentions that this letter and the Agent's acceptance would form a binding agreement. Then there's a section labeled \"Section 18. Entire Agreement,\" which states that this Agreement, including schedules and exhibits, is the entire agreement between the parties, superseding any prior agreements. \n\nLooking at the structure, the document refers to itself as \"This Agreement\" multiple times. For example, in Section 18, it says, \"This Agreement, including schedules and exhibits hereto...\" So the name of the contract is likely \"Agreement.\" However, sometimes legal documents have more specific names, like \"Amended and Restated Agreement\" or something similar. But in the context provided, there's no mention of a specific name beyond \"Agreement.\" \n\nAdditionally, the context mentions that modifications must be in writing and refer to \"this Agreement.\" The sections listed (like xviii and xix) seem to be parts of the same document. The numbering of pages (39 and 25) might be from a longer document, but the key term used throughout is \"Agreement.\" \n\nI don't see any other specific name given for the contract in the provided text. The parties involved are the Company, MHC, Bank, and Agent, but the document itself is referred to as \"this Agreement.\" Therefore, the answer should be \"Agreement.\"\n</think>\n\nThe name of the contract is **Agreement**. The document repeatedly refers to itself as \"This Agreement\" and outlines it as the binding legal document between the parties, superseding prior agreements. Specific sections (e.g., Section 18) and references to \"this Agreement\" confirm this designation. No alternative title is provided in the context. \n\nAnswer: Agreement",

      "question": "The name of the contract",
      "ground_truth_answer": "The name of the contract is the Remarketing Agreement, as stated in the preamble:\n\n\"THIS REMARKETING AGREEMENT, dated as of [\u25cf] (this \"Agreement\"), by and among Nuveen AMT-Free Municipal Credit Income Fund, a closed-end investment company organized as a Massachusetts business trust (the \"Fund\"), Nuveen Fund Advisors, LLC, a registered investment adviser and wholly-owned subsidiary of Nuveen Investments, Inc. (the \"Investment Adviser\"), and [\u25cf] (the \"Remarketing Agent\").\"",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out the answer to the question: \"The name of the contract\" based on the provided context.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the context given. The context is a legal document, probably an agreement between parties. The user is asking for the name of the contract. \n\nLooking at the context, I notice several sections and definitions. The first part defines terms like \"Agreement,\" \"Calculation and Paying Agent,\" \"Commission,\" \"Fund,\" and \"Indemnified Person.\" The term \"Agreement\" is mentioned as having the meaning set forth in the preamble. The preamble is typically the introductory part of a contract that states the parties involved and the purpose. \n\nFurther down, there are sections like \"Certain Provisions to Survive Termination of Agreement,\" \"Section 17. Successors and Assigns,\" \"Section 14. Governing Law,\" and others. These sections are part of the contract's body, discussing various legal terms and conditions. \n\nThe mention of \"Tender and Paying Agent Agreement\" in the definition of \"Calculation and Paying Agent\" might be a clue. However, the main contract here is referred to as \"this Agreement\" throughout the document. Since the question is asking for the name of the contract, and the document itself is part of that agreement, the name might be derived from the sections or the context. \n\nLooking at the sections again, there's a mention of \"Tender Notice\" towards the end, but that seems to be a part of the document rather than the contract's name. The key term here is \"Agreement,\" which is defined in the preamble. Since the preamble is part of the contract, the name of the contract is likely \"Agreement,\" but maybe there's a specific name given in the preamble. However, the user hasn't provided the actual preamble text, only that \"Agreement\" is defined there. \n\nAlternatively, considering the sections and the context, the contract could be named something like \"Tender and Paying Agent Agreement\" since that's mentioned in the definition. But the main contract here is the one that includes all these sections (like Sections 3, 4, 9, 10, 14, 17, etc.), which is referred to as \"this Agreement\" throughout. \n\nAnother angle: the document includes references to the \"1940 Act,\" which",

      "question": "Is a party subject to obligations after the termination or expiration of a contract, including any post-termination transition, payment, transfer of IP, wind-down, last-buy, or similar commitments?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, based on the information provided in the agreement, there are certain obligations that continue after the termination or expiration of the contract:\n\n1. The provisions of Sections 3.6, 4, 6, 8, 9 and 11 shall survive any termination of the agreement (Section 10.8).\n\n2. Any contract entered into by the Parties with a Marketer for the Product shall survive termination of the agreement in accordance with its terms, including any renewal rights provided therein (Section 10.1). \n\n3. Upon any breach by CAPSUGEL, CARDAX shall be permitted to use all Intellectual Property of CAPSUGEL used in the Formulation and the Product to the extent necessary for the development and marketing of the Product (Section 10.2).\n\n4. Upon any breach by CARDAX, CAPSUGEL shall be permitted to use all Intellectual Property of CARDAX used in the Active Ingredient and the Product to the extent necessary for the development and marketing of the Product in accordance with the terms of the agreement as of the date of such termination (Section 10.2).\n\n5. Each Party shall return to the other Party or to the other Party's designee no later than thirty (30) days after the effective date of termination all of such other Party's property, including all proprietary information, in its possession, except to the extent required to be retained by law or to comply with such Party's continuing obligations (Section 10.7).\n\nSo in summary, yes there are certain post-termination obligations, including the survival of certain provisions, the continuing effect of third-party contracts, and the return of proprietary information and materials.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether a party is subject to obligations after the termination or expiration of a contract, including things like post-termination transition, payment, transfer of IP, wind-down, last-buy, etc. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context to find relevant sections. The context includes several sections from a contract, specifically sections 10.7, 10.8, 11.1, 10.6, 10.2, and others.\n\nStarting with section 10.7 Property: It says that upon termination, each party must return the other's property, including proprietary information, within 30 days, except what's required by law or continuing obligations. So that's a clear post-termination obligation regarding returning property and IP.\n\nSection 10.8 Survival mentions that certain sections (like 3.6, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11) survive termination. This means those sections' obligations remain in effect even after termination. Section 11 includes Miscellaneous terms, like Dispute Resolution (11.1), which would still apply after termination.\n\nLooking at section 10.6 No Waiver: It states that not terminating for a breach isn't a waiver of future breaches. This relates to obligations post-termination if there was a breach.\n\nSection 10.2 Termination for Breach: If there's a material breach not cured, the contract can be terminated. Also, if CAPSUGEL is breached, CARDAX can use their IP for development. This implies obligations related to IP transfer or usage after termination due to breach.\n\nAdditionally, the context mentions that contracts with a Marketer survive termination according to their terms. So there's a survival of certain agreements beyond the main contract.\n\nOther sections like 11.8 Announcement and Confidentiality (Section 9) might also have obligations that continue after termination, such as keeping information confidential even after the contract ends.\n\nPutting this all together, the answer should confirm that yes, parties have obligations post-termination, including returning property, handling IP, surviving clauses like confidentiality, and handling breaches. The specific obligations are detailed in sections 10.7, 10.8, 10.2, and others mentioned.\n</think>\n\nYes, a party is subject to obligations after the termination or expiration of the contract,",

      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, the franchise agreement contains restrictions on the franchisee's ability to compete with Pretzel Time, both during the term of the franchise agreement and after its termination or expiration.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n1. During the term of the franchise agreement, the franchisee agrees that neither it, its affiliates, nor its owners will have any direct or indirect interest in a \"Competitive Business\" located at the franchise site, within 3 miles of the franchise unit, or within 3 miles of any other Pretzel Time unit in operation or under development (Section 21.A).\n\n2. After termination or expiration of the franchise agreement, the franchisee and its owners agree not to have any direct or indirect interest in a Competitive Business located at the franchise site, within 3 miles of the franchise unit, or within 3 miles of any other Pretzel Time unit in operation or under development for a period of 12 months (Section 20.G).\n\nThe agreement also restricts the franchisee from recruiting or hiring any employees who were employed by Pretzel Time or another Pretzel Time franchisee within the prior 6 months, without Pretzel Time's prior written permission (Section 21.A(2)).\n\nSo in summary, the franchise agreement imposes non-compete and non-solicitation restrictions on the franchisee both during the contract term and for a period after the contract ends.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether a party is restricted from contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty during the contract or after it ends. The context provided is about a franchise agreement with Pretzel Time.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the context for any mention of non-solicitation or non-compete clauses. The main section mentioned is 20.G, which is a Covenant Not to Compete. The details there say that after termination or expiration of the agreement, the Franchisee and its Owners can't be involved in a competitive business within certain areas for 12 months. However, the question is about soliciting customers or partners, not just operating a competing business.\n\nLooking through the provided context, the 20.G section focuses on geographical restrictions and ownership in competitive businesses. There's no explicit mention of non-solicitation clauses regarding customers or partners during the contract term or after. The restrictions are about not having an interest in a competitive business, not about contacting customers or partners. \n\nThe other parts of the context (like sections 1, 2, 3) deal with ownership structure and transfer of securities, but not solicitation. Since the question is about soliciting customers or partners, and the provided context doesn't mention such restrictions, the answer would be that there's no such restriction based on the given information. However, the user should check if there are other sections in the full agreement that might cover this, but based on the provided context, the answer is no.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: The provided context does not explicitly restrict the Franchisee or its Owners from contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty during the contract term or after its termination. The key restriction outlined in **Section 20.G (Covenant Not to Compete)** focuses on geographic limitations (e.g., operating a competitive business within 3 miles of the Unit or other Pretzel Time locations) and ownership in competitive businesses for 12 months post-termination. However, it does not address solicitation of customers, partners, or employees. Therefore, based on the given text, **no such restriction is specified**. Other provisions in the agreement (e.g., ownership transfer restrictions) also do not mention solicitation prohibitions. The answer is **no**, unless additional clauses outside the provided context impose such restrictions.",

This includes a commitment to procure all \u201crequirements\u201d from one party of certain technology, goods, or services or a prohibition on licensing or selling technology, goods or services to third parties, or a prohibition on\u00a0 collaborating or working with other parties), whether during the contract or\u00a0 after the contract ends (or both).",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the information provided in the context, there does not appear to be any explicit mention of an exclusive dealing commitment or requirement for the counterparty. The document appears to be an amendment to the \"Section 2, Part B of the Co-Branding Agreement\" between PC Quote, Inc. (PCQ) and A.B. Watley, Inc. (ABW), but it does not contain any details about exclusivity or prohibitions on collaborating with third parties. The document focuses on the term and effective date of the amendment, and it is signed by the representatives of the two companies, but there are no clauses indicating an exclusive dealing arrangement. Without any such provisions explicitly stated, the available information does not suggest the presence of an exclusive dealing commitment in this context.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if there's an exclusive dealing commitment in the provided context. The context is an amendment to a co-branding agreement between PC Quote, Inc. (PCQ) and A.B. Watley, Inc. (ABW). The amendment is about Section 2, Part B, which is titled \"Term.\" The document mentions that the amendment is effective December 9, 1996, and includes signatures from both parties with dates of December 5 and December 12, 1996.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what an exclusive dealing commitment entails. It usually means that one party agrees to buy all their needs from the other party, or not to deal with others, or similar restrictions. The question is whether such a commitment exists here.\n\nLooking at the provided context, the main document is an amendment to the Term section. The Term section typically deals with the duration of the agreement, not the exclusivity of dealings. The amendment might be changing the length of time the agreement is in effect, but there's no mention of exclusivity in the text provided. The sources cited are SEC filings (S-1/A), which are related to stock offerings, but again, the specific content here is about the amendment's effective date and signatures.\n\nThe text of the amendment states that it applies to PCQ and ABW and their subsidiaries. However, there's no language indicating that either party must procure all requirements from the other, or that they can't work with third parties. The term \"co-branding\" might imply some level of collaboration, but co-branding agreements can vary. Without specific clauses about exclusivity, such as \"exclusive rights\" or \"no dealing with others,\" it's hard to infer an exclusive dealing commitment.\n\nThe answer would depend on whether the amendment itself includes such exclusivity terms. Since the provided context only mentions the amendment to the Term and the parties involved, and there's no explicit mention of exclusive dealing, the answer would likely be no. However, I should check if there's any implied exclusivity in the Term section. Typically, Term sections don't include exclusivity unless specified. Since the user's question is about the amendment to Section 2 (Term), unless the amendment itself adds exclusivity, which it doesn't in the given text, the answer remains no.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: No, the provided context does not indicate an exclusive dealing commitment.
