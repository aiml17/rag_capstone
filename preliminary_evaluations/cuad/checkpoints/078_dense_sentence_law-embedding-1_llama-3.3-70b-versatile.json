      "question": "Is a party\u2019s liability uncapped upon the breach of its obligation in the contract? This also includes uncap liability for a particular type of breach such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality obligation.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the context provided in the Cooperation Agreement, there does not appear to be any uncapped liability for a party's breach of the contract. The agreement does not explicitly state that a party's liability is uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.\n\nThe relevant sections are:\n\n1. Clause 5 on Confidential Information, which states that the obligations of confidentiality shall remain in force until the relevant information enters the public domain otherwise than by the default of a party. This suggests there is no uncapped liability for breach of the confidentiality obligation.\n\n2. Clause 4.1 regarding QIWI's obligation to settle transactions through Otkritie's bank. This clause states that if QIWI terminates this obligation, it shall pay a fee to Otkritie, but this fee is capped at RUB 50,000,000. This indicates a cap on liability for breach of this specific obligation.\n\n3. The agreement does not contain any other provisions that suggest uncapped liability for breach of the contract or specific types of breaches. The dispute resolution clause (Clause 9) also does not indicate uncapped damages.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the Cooperation Agreement, the liability of the parties does not appear to be uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.",
      "generated_response": "The provided context does not explicitly state that a party's liability is uncapped upon the breach of its obligation in the contract. However, it does mention a specific scenario in Clause 4.1 where QIWI may terminate its obligation, and in such a case, QIWI shall pay to Otkritie a fee equal to the demonstrated costs incurred by Otkritie, with a cap of RUB 50,000,000 (fifty million roubles). \n\nFor other types of breaches, such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality obligation, the contract does not provide a specific cap on liability. Nevertheless, it is essential to note that the contract does contain a clause (7.2) that addresses the situation when a provision is void or unenforceable due to Applicable Law, and the parties shall use reasonable endeavors to replace the invalid provision with a valid and enforceable substitute provision. \n\nIn summary, while there is a specific cap on liability in the scenario described in Clause 4.1, the contract does not provide a general statement on uncapped liability for breaches, including IP infringement or breach of confidentiality obligations.",

Franchisee  also  acknowledges  that Pretzel Time has granted the Franchise to  Franchisee  in  consideration  of and reliance  upon  Franchisee's agreement to deal  exclusively  with Pretzel Time.

Notwithstanding the foregoing,  Franchisee shall not be prohibited from owning securities  listed on a stock exchange or traded on the  over-the-counter market that represents two percent (2%) or less of that class of securities.
