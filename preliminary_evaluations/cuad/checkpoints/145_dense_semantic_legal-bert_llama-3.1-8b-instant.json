      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the context provided in the Cooperation Agreement, there does not appear to be any uncapped liability for a party's breach of the contract. The agreement does not explicitly state that a party's liability is uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.\n\nThe relevant sections are:\n\n1. Clause 5 on Confidential Information, which states that the obligations of confidentiality shall remain in force until the relevant information enters the public domain otherwise than by the default of a party. This suggests there is no uncapped liability for breach of the confidentiality obligation.\n\n2. Clause 4.1 regarding QIWI's obligation to settle transactions through Otkritie's bank. This clause states that if QIWI terminates this obligation, it shall pay a fee to Otkritie, but this fee is capped at RUB 50,000,000. This indicates a cap on liability for breach of this specific obligation.\n\n3. The agreement does not contain any other provisions that suggest uncapped liability for breach of the contract or specific types of breaches. The dispute resolution clause (Clause 9) also does not indicate uncapped damages.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the Cooperation Agreement, the liability of the parties does not appear to be uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.",
      "generated_response": "Based on the provided context, it appears that the contract does not explicitly state that a party's liability is uncapped upon the breach of its obligation. However, there is a specific clause (4.1) that mentions a cap on the fee that QIWI must pay to Otkritie in the event of terminating its obligation to settle transactions through PJSC Khanty-Mansiysk Bank Otkritie. The fee is capped at RUB 50,000,000 (fifty million roubles).\n\nThere is no mention of uncapped liability for IP infringement or breach of confidentiality obligation. In fact, the contract mentions the protection of confidential or competitively sensitive information in Clause 2.1, but it does not specify any particular liability for breach of confidentiality.\n\nIt's worth noting that the contract does not provide a general cap on liability for all types of breaches, and it's possible that a party's liability could be uncapped in certain circumstances. However, based on the provided context, there is no explicit indication of uncapped liability.",

This implies that the parties may have ongoing obligations to the Marketer even after the termination of the main agreement.\n\nHowever, the extent of these obligations is not explicitly stated in the provided context. It would be necessary to review the specific contract with the Marketer to determine the exact post-termination obligations. \n\nIn general, it seems that the parties may have some ongoing obligations, but the specifics would depend on the terms of the contract with the Marketer.",

      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, the franchise agreement contains restrictions on the franchisee's ability to compete with Pretzel Time, both during the term of the franchise agreement and after its termination or expiration.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n1. During the term of the franchise agreement, the franchisee agrees that neither it, its affiliates, nor its owners will have any direct or indirect interest in a \"Competitive Business\" located at the franchise site, within 3 miles of the franchise unit, or within 3 miles of any other Pretzel Time unit in operation or under development (Section 21.A).\n\n2. After termination or expiration of the franchise agreement, the franchisee and its owners agree not to have any direct or indirect interest in a Competitive Business located at the franchise site, within 3 miles of the franchise unit, or within 3 miles of any other Pretzel Time unit in operation or under development for a period of 12 months (Section 20.G).\n\nThe agreement also restricts the franchisee from recruiting or hiring any employees who were employed by Pretzel Time or another Pretzel Time franchisee within the prior 6 months, without Pretzel Time's prior written permission (Section 21.A(2)).\n\nSo in summary, the franchise agreement imposes non-compete and non-solicitation restrictions on the franchisee both during the contract term and for a period after the contract ends.",
      "generated_response": "Based on the provided context, it appears that there are restrictions on certain activities after the contract ends, but not necessarily during the contract.\n\nUpon termination or expiration of the Agreement, the Franchisee and its Owners agree to cease using any Confidential Information of Pretzel Time or its Affiliates. This provision does not explicitly restrict contracting or soliciting customers or partners during the contract.\n\nHowever, upon termination or expiration of the Agreement, there is a restriction on having any direct or indirect interest in a Competitive Business within a certain radius of the Unit or other Pretzel Time Units. This restriction is in place for a period of 12 months after the termination or expiration of the Agreement.\n\nAdditionally, the provision on Competitive Business does not explicitly restrict contracting or soliciting customers or partners, but rather restricts having an interest in a business that competes with Pretzel Time.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that there are restrictions on certain activities after the contract ends, but it is not explicitly stated that a party is restricted from contracting or soliciting customers or partners during the contract.",
