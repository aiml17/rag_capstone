      "question": "Is a party\u2019s liability uncapped upon the breach of its obligation in the contract? This also includes uncap liability for a particular type of breach such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality obligation.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the context provided in the Cooperation Agreement, there does not appear to be any uncapped liability for a party's breach of the contract. The agreement does not explicitly state that a party's liability is uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.\n\nThe relevant sections are:\n\n1. Clause 5 on Confidential Information, which states that the obligations of confidentiality shall remain in force until the relevant information enters the public domain otherwise than by the default of a party. This suggests there is no uncapped liability for breach of the confidentiality obligation.\n\n2. Clause 4.1 regarding QIWI's obligation to settle transactions through Otkritie's bank. This clause states that if QIWI terminates this obligation, it shall pay a fee to Otkritie, but this fee is capped at RUB 50,000,000. This indicates a cap on liability for breach of this specific obligation.\n\n3. The agreement does not contain any other provisions that suggest uncapped liability for breach of the contract or specific types of breaches. The dispute resolution clause (Clause 9) also does not indicate uncapped damages.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the Cooperation Agreement, the liability of the parties does not appear to be uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.",
      "generated_response": "The provided context does not explicitly state that a party's liability is uncapped upon breach of its obligations in the contract. However, it does outline specific obligations and potential consequences for breaches, such as those related to confidentiality (Clause 5). For instance, Clause 5.1 imposes obligations on the parties to maintain confidentiality, and Clause 5.4 discusses the procedure in case an Affiliate is compelled to disclose Confidential Information, indicating steps to mitigate the effects of such disclosure.\n\nRegarding intellectual property (IP) infringement, the context does not directly address liability for IP infringement. The closest related topic is the use of the NKO Rapida brands owned by QIWI Group by Otkritie, which is mentioned under potential areas of joint cooperation (Section 3.6(g)), but it does not specify the liability for infringement.\n\nFor breach of confidentiality, the contract implies that the disclosing party shall take all reasonable steps to preserve confidentiality and ensure the information is used only for the purposes for which it has been disclosed (Clauses 5.2 and 5.3). While it outlines procedures for handling breaches of confidentiality, such as notification and cooperation to mitigate effects, it does not explicitly cap or uncaps liability for such breaches.\n\nGiven the information provided, it's reasonable to infer that while the contract specifies procedures and obligations related to breaches, including those of confidentiality, it does not explicitly state that liability is uncapped for any type of breach, including IP infringement or breach of confidentiality. However, without a direct statement on liability caps, and considering that contractual liability can often be subject to the governing law (in this case, the laws of England and Wales, as per Clause 9.1), the actual extent of liability could depend on the interpretation of the contract within the context of applicable law.",

However, based on the given information, we can infer some potential post-termination obligations.\n\nAccording to the context, in the event of termination, the parties will still be bound by certain obligations, such as:\n\n1. Confidentiality: The parties are required to keep confidential information confidential, which implies that this obligation will continue after termination.\n2. Intellectual Property: The context mentions that the parties will jointly own intellectual property rights developed under the agreement, and each party will have a perpetual, royalty-free license to use such intellectual property. This suggests that the parties may have ongoing obligations related to intellectual property after termination.\n3. Transition: Although not explicitly stated, the context implies that the parties may need to cooperate in transitioning activities, such as winding down development work or transferring intellectual property, after termination.\n\nHowever, the context does not provide a comprehensive overview of post-termination obligations, including payment, transfer of IP, wind-down, last-buy, or similar commitments.
