      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking about the duration of any warranty against defects or errors in technology, products, or services provided under the contract. The context given is an amendment to a co-branding agreement between PC Quote, Inc. and A.B. Watley, Inc., effective December 9, 1996.\n\nFirst, I need to check the provided context thoroughly. The amendment is about Section 2, Part B, which is titled \"Term.\" The Term section usually outlines the duration of the contract. However, the user is asking about warranties, which are typically covered in a different section of a contract, like a warranty clause. \n\nLooking at the context provided, the main content is the amendment to the Term. There's no mention of warranties, defects, or errors in the provided text. The agreement is between PCQ and ABW, and the amendment applies to them and their subsidiaries. The signatures are from Steven Malin and Howard Meltzer on December 5 and 12, 1996, respectively. \n\nSince the context doesn't include any information about warranties or the duration of warranties, I can't find the answer here. The user might be referring to another part of the Co-Branding Agreement that isn't included in this amendment. The answer would need to state that the provided context doesn't contain information about warranty duration. It's possible that the warranty terms are in a different section or document not provided here. Therefore, the correct response is that the information isn't available in the given context.\n</think>\n\nThe provided context does not include any specific information regarding the duration of warranties against defects or errors in technology, products, or services under the contract. The text focuses solely on an amendment to the \"Term\" (Section 2, Part B) of the Co-Branding Agreement, with no mention of warranty provisions. To answer this question fully, additional sections of the agreement or related documents would need to be referenced. \n\n**Answer:** The context does not specify the duration of warranties against defects or errors in technology, products, or services.",

      "question": "Is a party\u2019s liability uncapped upon the breach of its obligation in the contract? This also includes uncap liability for a particular type of breach such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality obligation.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the context provided in the Cooperation Agreement, there does not appear to be any uncapped liability for a party's breach of the contract. The agreement does not explicitly state that a party's liability is uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.\n\nThe relevant sections are:\n\n1. Clause 5 on Confidential Information, which states that the obligations of confidentiality shall remain in force until the relevant information enters the public domain otherwise than by the default of a party. This suggests there is no uncapped liability for breach of the confidentiality obligation.\n\n2. Clause 4.1 regarding QIWI's obligation to settle transactions through Otkritie's bank. This clause states that if QIWI terminates this obligation, it shall pay a fee to Otkritie, but this fee is capped at RUB 50,000,000. This indicates a cap on liability for breach of this specific obligation.\n\n3. The agreement does not contain any other provisions that suggest uncapped liability for breach of the contract or specific types of breaches. The dispute resolution clause (Clause 9) also does not indicate uncapped damages.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the Cooperation Agreement, the liability of the parties does not appear to be uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether a party's liability is uncapped upon breaching the contract, including specific breaches like IP infringement or confidentiality. I need to look through the provided context to find any clauses that mention liability caps or uncapped liabilities.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the clauses. The main clauses mentioned are 3.6 to 3.9 and 4.1. The question is about liability, so I should look for any mention of liability, damages, or caps. \n\nLooking at Clause 4.1: It talks about QIWI's obligation to settle transactions through Otkritie for two years. If QIWI terminates this obligation, they have to pay a fee equal to the demonstrated costs incurred by Otkritie, but this fee can't exceed 50 million rubles. That seems like a cap on liability for that specific obligation. However, the question is about whether liability is uncapped in general, including other breaches like IP or confidentiality.\n\nNow, checking other clauses. The context doesn't mention IP infringement or confidentiality obligations directly. The other clauses (3.6-3.9) discuss cooperation areas and the Steering Committee, but not liability caps. There's no general clause stating that liability is uncapped for all breaches. The only cap mentioned is in 4.1 for the termination fee. \n\nSince there's no mention of liability caps for other breaches, the default would be that liability isn't capped unless specified. But the question is whether it's uncapped. The answer would depend on whether the contract has a general liability cap clause. Since the provided context doesn't include such a clause, the answer would be that liability is uncapped except where specifically capped, like in 4.1. However, the user is asking if it's uncapped in general. The presence of a cap in 4.1 shows that at least some liabilities are capped, but others aren't. The question includes IP and confidentiality breaches, which aren't addressed here. So, unless there's a general cap clause elsewhere, those would be uncapped. Since the context doesn't mention a general cap, the answer would be yes, liability is uncapped for breaches not specified with a cap.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: Based on the provided context, the parties' liability is **not uncapped** in all cases. Specifically, Clause 4.1 includes a **cap on liability**",

      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, according to the General Provisions of the Sponsorship Agreement, the Sponsor (Rubio's Fresh Mexican Grill) must obtain and continuously maintain certain insurance policies for the benefit of the counterparty, SDBF (San Diego Ballpark Funding LLC):\n\nSpecifically, Section 8(c) states that Sponsor must obtain and continuously maintain the following insurance policies:\n\n1. Workers' Compensation insurance with minimum liability limits.\n\n2. An occurrence-based Commercial General Liability Insurance Policy with minimum liability limits.\n\nThe policies must name SDBF, Padres LP, the City of San Diego, and their subsidiary/affiliated companies and directors/officers/employees as Additional Insureds.

Let me look through the provided context carefully.\n\nFirst, the context mentions that the Sponsor must provide SDBF with certificates of insurance. The key part here is: \"Sponsor shall provide SDBF with certificates of insurance evidencing compliance with all insurance provisions noted above prior to the commencement of the sponsorship and annually prior to the expiration of each required insurance policy.\" So, the Sponsor is required to have insurance and provide proof to SDBF. \n\nAdditionally, it says all policies must be endorsed with a Waiver of Subrogation in favor of SDBF. That means the insurance policies should protect SDBF by waiving any right to subrogate against them. \n\nThe question is about whether there's a requirement for insurance maintained by one party for the benefit of the counterparty. Since the Sponsor is required to maintain insurance (and provide certificates) that complies with the agreement's provisions, and the policies must include a waiver of subrogation for SDBF's benefit, this seems to fit. The Sponsor's insurance is for the benefit of SDBF, as it protects them from certain claims. \n\nI don't see any mention of SDBF needing to provide insurance for the Sponsor, so the requirement is specifically on the Sponsor. The answer should confirm that yes, the Sponsor must maintain insurance for SDBF's benefit, evidenced by the certificates and the waiver of subrogation.\n</think>\n\nYes, the Sponsor is required to maintain insurance for the benefit of SDBF.

Representations and Warranties of the Agent. The Offering. (iv) The Bank is a member of the FHLB-Dallas. Section 12.\" \n\nFirst, I need to figure out what contract this refers to. The key parts here are \"Representations and Warranties of the Agent\" and \"Section 12.\" In legal documents, sections are often labeled with numbers and titles. The mention of \"The Offering\" might relate to a real estate or financial offering, possibly a mortgage or loan agreement.\n\nThe FHLB-Dallas refers to the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas, which is part of the Federal Home Loan Bank System. Banks that are members of the FHLB have access to various financial services. If the Bank is a member here, it might be part of a mortgage or loan contract.\n\nLooking at the structure, \"Section 12\" is likely part of a larger contract. The title \"Representations and Warranties of the Agent\" suggests that this is a section within a contract where the agent (possibly a real estate agent or a financial agent) makes certain promises or assurances. \n\nIn real estate transactions, common contracts include purchase agreements, loan agreements, or agency agreements. Given the mention of the FHLB, which is related to mortgage lending, this could be part of a mortgage loan agreement. However, the term \"The Offering\" might also point towards a securities offering, like a stock or bond offering, but combined with the FHLB reference, it's more likely a mortgage-related document.\n\nAnother angle: sometimes contracts have sections that outline representations and warranties by parties involved. If the agent is making these, and it's under Section 12, maybe the contract is a \"Loan Agreement\" or \"Mortgage Agreement.\" Alternatively, if it's about an offering, perhaps a \"Securities Purchase Agreement\" or \"Offering Memorandum.\"\n\nBut the key here is to look for the most probable name based on the given context. The presence of \"Construction\" at the start might indicate that this is part of a construction loan or a construction project agreement. So, the contract could be a \"Construction Loan Agreement\" or \"Construction Contract.\"\n\nHowever, the mention of the FHLB-Dallas as a member of the Bank suggests that the",

The sections refer to specific parts of the contract, like Section 9, 10, 12. The key part here is \"Appointment and Obligations of the Remarketing Agent.\" That sounds like a specific clause or section within the contract.\n\nWait, maybe the contract is named after the main subject here.

      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, based on the information provided in the agreement, there are certain obligations that continue after the termination or expiration of the contract:\n\n1. The provisions of Sections 3.6, 4, 6, 8, 9 and 11 shall survive any termination of the agreement (Section 10.8).\n\n2. Any contract entered into by the Parties with a Marketer for the Product shall survive termination of the agreement in accordance with its terms, including any renewal rights provided therein (Section 10.1). \n\n3. Upon any breach by CAPSUGEL, CARDAX shall be permitted to use all Intellectual Property of CAPSUGEL used in the Formulation and the Product to the extent necessary for the development and marketing of the Product (Section 10.2).\n\n4. Upon any breach by CARDAX, CAPSUGEL shall be permitted to use all Intellectual Property of CARDAX used in the Active Ingredient and the Product to the extent necessary for the development and marketing of the Product in accordance with the terms of the agreement as of the date of such termination (Section 10.2).\n\n5. Each Party shall return to the other Party or to the other Party's designee no later than thirty (30) days after the effective date of termination all of such other Party's property, including all proprietary information, in its possession, except to the extent required to be retained by law or to comply with such Party's continuing obligations (Section 10.7).\n\nSo in summary, yes there are certain post-termination obligations, including the survival of certain provisions, the continuing effect of third-party contracts, and the return of proprietary information and materials.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether a party is subject to obligations after the termination or expiration of a contract, including things like post-termination transition, payments, IP transfer, wind-down, last-buy, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the provided context. The context includes parts of an agreement, specifically Sections 10 and 3. \n\nStarting with Section 10.1 Term and Renewal. It mentions that any contract entered into by the Parties with a Marketer for the Product shall survive termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, including any renewal rights. So, this suggests that certain contracts with Marketers continue even after the main agreement is terminated. That implies there are obligations post-termination related to those specific contracts.\n\nThen, looking at Section 3.1 Background IP. It states that the Agreement doesn't confer rights to Background IP except as provided. Also, during the Term, each Party gives a worldwide, exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual license for the jointly owned IP related to the Product. The license is perpetual, which means it continues even after the Term ends. So, there's an ongoing obligation to license the jointly owned IP. \n\nAdditionally, the Background IP rights aren't affected by the Agreement, so if there's any IP that was owned before, those rights remain, but the Agreement doesn't grant access to them. However, the jointly owned IP from the work under the Agreement is licensed perpetually. \n\nIn Section 15, there's a termination clause where CARDAX can terminate if development isn't feasible due to legal or technical issues. But the question is about obligations after termination. The key points here are the survival of certain contracts (Section 10.1) and the perpetual licenses (Section 3.1). \n\nSo, putting it all together: Yes, parties are subject to obligations post-termination. Specifically, the contracts with Marketers survive, so any obligations under those contracts would still apply. Also, the perpetual licenses for jointly owned IP mean that the licensing obligations continue indefinitely. There's also mention of no rights to Background IP, so that's a limitation. The answer should mention that obligations like IP licensing (perpetual), survival of marketer contracts, and any other terms in the agreement that specify post-termination duties apply. The answer should be affirmative, citing the relevant sections.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: Yes, parties may be subject to post-termination",

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether a party is restricted from contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty during or after the contract ends. I need to check the provided context for any such restrictions.\n\nLooking through the context, the main sections talk about the termination of the agreement, confidentiality, and non-compete clauses. The non-compete part mentions that after termination or expiration, the Franchisee and Owners can't be involved in a Competitive Business within certain areas for 12 months. But the question is about soliciting customers or partners.\n\nWait, the context doesn't explicitly mention anything about soliciting customers or partners. The confidentiality clause says they can't use Confidential Information after termination, but that's about information, not direct solicitation. The non-compete is about operating a competitive business, not about contacting customers or partners. There's also a part about Special Distribution Arrangements, but that's about rights to operate those, not solicitation.\n\nSo based on the given context, there's no direct restriction on contracting or soliciting customers or partners. The answer should be that the context doesn't specify such restrictions. The user might be thinking of a non-solicitation clause, but it's not present here. Therefore, the answer is no, unless there's another part I missed. Let me check again. No, the context doesn't include any clauses about non-solicitation of customers or partners. The restrictions are on using confidential info and operating a competitive business nearby.
