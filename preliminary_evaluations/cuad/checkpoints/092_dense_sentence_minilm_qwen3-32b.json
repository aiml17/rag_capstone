The context is an amendment to the \"Term\" section of a Co-Branding Agreement between PC Quote, Inc. and A.B.

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking about the duration of any warranty against defects or errors in technology, products, or services provided under the contract. The context given is an amendment to a co-branding agreement between PC Quote, Inc. and A.B. Watley, Inc., effective December 9, 1996.\n\nFirst, I need to check the provided context thoroughly. The context includes the amendment document, which is part of the Co-Branding Agreement. The main sections mentioned are the amendment to Section 2, Part B, titled \"Term.\" The Term section usually refers to the duration of the contract, not the warranty. The amendment is about the term, so it might specify how long the agreement lasts, but the user is asking about warranties related to defects or errors.\n\nLooking at the provided text, there's a mention of the amendment being effective December 9, 1996, and the agreement is between PCQ and ABW. The signatories are Steven Malin and Howard Meltzer, with dates December 5, 1996, and December 12, 1996. However, the actual content of the amendment isn't detailed here. The context only mentions that it's an amendment to the Term section. There's no mention of warranties, defects, errors, or any duration related to those aspects.\n\nSince the context provided doesn't include any information about warranties or their duration, I can't find a direct answer. The user might be expecting that the Term section would include warranty periods, but without specific language in the amendment about warranties, it's impossible to determine the duration. The answer would have to be that the information isn't available in the provided context. The user might need to refer to other sections of the Co-Branding Agreement that aren't included here for details on warranties.\n</think>\n\nThe provided context does not specify the duration of any warranty against defects or errors in technology, products, or services under the contract. The document details an amendment to the \"Term\" section of the Co-Branding Agreement but does not include language addressing warranties or their duration. To determine the warranty period, additional sections of the full Co-Branding Agreement (not included here) would need to be referenced. \n\n**Answer:** The context does not provide information about the duration of warranties for defects or errors in technology, products, or services.",

      "question": "Is a party\u2019s liability uncapped upon the breach of its obligation in the contract? This also includes uncap liability for a particular type of breach such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality obligation.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the context provided in the Cooperation Agreement, there does not appear to be any uncapped liability for a party's breach of the contract. The agreement does not explicitly state that a party's liability is uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.\n\nThe relevant sections are:\n\n1. Clause 5 on Confidential Information, which states that the obligations of confidentiality shall remain in force until the relevant information enters the public domain otherwise than by the default of a party. This suggests there is no uncapped liability for breach of the confidentiality obligation.\n\n2. Clause 4.1 regarding QIWI's obligation to settle transactions through Otkritie's bank. This clause states that if QIWI terminates this obligation, it shall pay a fee to Otkritie, but this fee is capped at RUB 50,000,000. This indicates a cap on liability for breach of this specific obligation.\n\n3. The agreement does not contain any other provisions that suggest uncapped liability for breach of the contract or specific types of breaches. The dispute resolution clause (Clause 9) also does not indicate uncapped damages.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the Cooperation Agreement, the liability of the parties does not appear to be uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out the answer to this question. The user is asking whether a party's liability is uncapped if they breach the contract, specifically including things like IP infringement or breach of confidentiality. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context to see if there's any mention of liability caps or uncapped liability. The context given is about confidentiality clauses, specifically in clauses 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, and 6.1. \n\nLooking at the confidentiality sections, the main points are about when parties can disclose information and the obligations they have. For example, in 5.1, they can't disclose Confidential Information except under certain circumstances listed in 5.2. There's also mention of what happens if they have to disclose due to legal requirements, like giving notice and trying to get assurances of confidentiality.\n\nBut the question is about liability being uncapped. The context doesn't explicitly mention liability caps or uncapped liability. There's no part that says \"liability is limited to X\" or \"liability is uncapped for breaches.\" The clauses here are about the obligations and exceptions for disclosure, not about the consequences of breaching those obligations. \n\nSince the provided context doesn't discuss liability limits, the answer would be that the information given doesn't specify whether liability is capped or not. The user might need to look elsewhere in the contract, perhaps in other clauses not provided here, for details on liability. \n\nTherefore, based solely on the given context, we can't determine if the liability is uncapped. The answer should state that the context doesn't address liability caps.\n</think>\n\nThe provided context does not specify whether a party's liability is uncapped for breaches of the contract, including specific breaches like IP infringement or confidentiality violations. The text focuses on obligations regarding the disclosure and protection of Confidential Information, exceptions to confidentiality (e.g., legal requirements, use by Affiliates), and procedural steps for disclosure. However, it does not address the scope or limits of liability for breaches. To determine liability caps or uncap liability, additional clauses (e.g., indemnification, limitation of liability provisions) not included in the provided context would need to be reviewed. \n\n**Answer:** The context does not specify whether liability is uncapped for breaches, including IP infringement or confidentiality violations. Liability terms would depend on other provisions of the agreement not provided here.",

      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, according to the General Provisions of the Sponsorship Agreement, the Sponsor (Rubio's Fresh Mexican Grill) must obtain and continuously maintain certain insurance policies for the benefit of the counterparty, SDBF (San Diego Ballpark Funding LLC):\n\nSpecifically, Section 8(c) states that Sponsor must obtain and continuously maintain the following insurance policies:\n\n1. Workers' Compensation insurance with minimum liability limits.\n\n2. An occurrence-based Commercial General Liability Insurance Policy with minimum liability limits.\n\nThe policies must name SDBF, Padres LP, the City of San Diego, and their subsidiary/affiliated companies and directors/officers/employees as Additional Insureds. The policies must also contain Cross Liability Endorsements and a Waiver of Subrogation in favor of SDBF.\n\nSponsor must provide SDBF with certificates of insurance evidencing compliance with these insurance requirements prior to the commencement of the sponsorship and annually prior to the expiration of each required insurance policy.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if there's a requirement for insurance that one party must maintain for the benefit of the counterparty. The context provided is a legal document, specifically a sponsorship agreement, which includes several insurance and indemnification clauses.\n\nFirst, I need to parse through the context to find relevant sections. The context mentions that the Sponsor must obtain and maintain certain insurance policies. Specifically, there's a Workers' Compensation policy and a Commercial General Liability Insurance Policy. These policies have specific requirements, like minimum limits and the need for an admitted carrier with a certain A.M. Best rating. \n\nLooking at the Commercial General Liability part, it states that SDBF, Padres LP, the City of San Diego, and their subsidiaries must be named as Additional Insureds. This is important because being an Additional Insured means that these parties are covered under the Sponsor's insurance policy. So the Sponsor's insurance is not just for their own benefit but also for the counterparty (SDBF and others). \n\nAdditionally, there's a Cross Liability Endorsement mentioned, which would handle situations where multiple insured parties are involved in a claim. This further supports the idea that the insurance is for the benefit of both parties. \n\nThe indemnification clauses also mention that if a claim is brought against either party, the other must defend them. However, the question specifically asks about insurance maintained by one party for the counterparty's benefit. The key here is the requirement for the Sponsor to have insurance policies that include the counterparty as Additional Insureds. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the Sponsor is required to maintain insurance (Workers' Comp and Commercial General Liability) that includes the counterparty (SDBF, Padres LP, etc.) as Additional Insureds. This meets the requirement of one party maintaining insurance for the benefit of the counterparty. The answer should confirm this and reference the specific policies and the Additional Insureds clause.\n</think>\n\nYes, the context specifies that the Sponsor must maintain certain insurance policies for the benefit of the counterparty (referred to as the \"Padres Parties\" or \"SDBF\" and related entities).

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the renewal term after the initial term expires, including automatic extensions and unilateral extensions with prior notice. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context to find any information about the agreement's duration beyond the initial term. The context mentions that the agreement is in effect until March 18, 2021, and either party can terminate it with 30 days written notice without cause. That's in section 10. \n\nNow, the key here is whether there's any mention of a renewal term. The initial term ends on March 18, 2021. The question is about what happens after that. The context doesn't explicitly state that the agreement renews automatically. It only says that either party can terminate it with 30 days notice. So, if neither party gives notice, does the agreement continue? The context doesn't specify a renewal term or automatic extension beyond the initial term. \n\nLooking at other sections, like section 11 and 12, they discuss termination and non-contestation, but nothing about renewal. Section 15 and 16 talk about assignment and discounts, but again, no renewal terms. The agreement is supposed to be the complete statement of the agreement, so if there's no mention of a renewal, then there's no automatic extension. \n\nThe user is asking if there's a renewal term, including automatic or unilateral extensions. Since the context doesn't mention any such terms, the answer would be that there is no renewal term. The agreement ends on the specified date unless terminated earlier. There's no indication that it renews automatically or that one party can unilaterally extend it beyond the initial term. The only way it continues past the initial term is if neither party gives the 30-day notice, but that's not a renewal term\u2014it's just the agreement continuing until termination. \n\nSo, the answer should state that there is no renewal term specified.

      "question": "Does the contract contain a license grant to a licensee (incl. sublicensor) and the affiliates of such licensee/sublicensor?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "No, the contract does not contain a license grant to a licensee or the affiliates of such licensee. The contract grants Distributor (GLS LLC) a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use and sublicense the Software provided by Airspan, but it does not explicitly grant a license or rights to any affiliates of the Distributor.\n\nSpecifically, Section 11.1 states:\n\n\"Airspan grants Distributor, and Distributor hereby accepts, a nonexclusive, non-transferable license to use, and to sublicense as set forth below, Software provided by Airspan hereunder only on a single System or unit of Equipment, as may be applicable.\"\n\nThere is no mention of affiliates of the Distributor being granted any license or rights to the Software.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the contract contains a license grant to a licensee, including their affiliates. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context for any mentions of license grants. The user mentioned looking at the SOFTWARE LICENSE section, which is section 11. \n\nIn section 11.1, it says that Airspan grants the Distributor a nonexclusive, non-transferable license to use and sublicense the Software. The Distributor is allowed to sublicense as set forth below, but the specifics of that sublicensing aren't detailed here. The license is for use on a single System or unit of Equipment. Also, there's a mention that the license is non-transferable. \n\nNow, the question is whether this license includes the affiliates of the Distributor. The term \"licensee\" here would be the Distributor, and the question is if their affiliates are included. The contract doesn't explicitly mention affiliates in the license grant. The license is given to the Distributor, and the Distributor can sublicense as per the agreement. However, the sublicense is part of the Distributor's rights, not automatically extending to their affiliates unless specified. \n\nLooking at the rest of section 11, there are terms about how the Software must be used, like not modifying it, not reverse engineering, etc. But there's no mention of affiliates. The key part is in 11.1 where the license is granted to the Distributor. Since the license is non-transferable, the Distributor can't transfer it to another party, which would include their affiliates. However, the Distributor can sublicense, but that's different from transferring the license. \n\nSo, the license is granted to the Distributor (the licensee) and allows them to sublicense, but there's no explicit mention of affiliates. Unless the sublicense includes affiliates, which isn't stated here. The answer would depend on whether the sublicense can be given to affiliates. Since the contract doesn't specify that the sublicense can be given to affiliates, we can't assume that. Therefore, the license is only for the Distributor and any sublicensing they do as per the agreement, but not automatically to their affiliates.\n</think>\n\nThe contract does **not** explicitly contain a license grant to the affiliates of the licensee (Distributor) or sublicensor. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **License Grant Scope**:  \n   - Section 11.1 grants the Distributor (",

      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, based on the information provided in the agreement, there are certain obligations that continue after the termination or expiration of the contract:\n\n1. The provisions of Sections 3.6, 4, 6, 8, 9 and 11 shall survive any termination of the agreement (Section 10.8).\n\n2. Any contract entered into by the Parties with a Marketer for the Product shall survive termination of the agreement in accordance with its terms, including any renewal rights provided therein (Section 10.1). \n\n3. Upon any breach by CAPSUGEL, CARDAX shall be permitted to use all Intellectual Property of CAPSUGEL used in the Formulation and the Product to the extent necessary for the development and marketing of the Product (Section 10.2).\n\n4. Upon any breach by CARDAX, CAPSUGEL shall be permitted to use all Intellectual Property of CARDAX used in the Active Ingredient and the Product to the extent necessary for the development and marketing of the Product in accordance with the terms of the agreement as of the date of such termination (Section 10.2).\n\n5. Each Party shall return to the other Party or to the other Party's designee no later than thirty (30) days after the effective date of termination all of such other Party's property, including all proprietary information, in its possession, except to the extent required to be retained by law or to comply with such Party's continuing obligations (Section 10.7).\n\nSo in summary, yes there are certain post-termination obligations, including the survival of certain provisions, the continuing effect of third-party contracts, and the return of proprietary information and materials.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether a party is subject to obligations after the termination or expiration of a contract, including things like post-termination transition, payment, transfer of IP, wind-down, last-buy, etc. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the provided context. The context includes several sections from a contract, specifically sections 10.7, 10.8, 11.1, and parts of 10.3 and 10.4. \n\nStarting with section 10.7 Property: It says that upon termination, each party must return the other's property, including proprietary information, within 30 days, except what's required by law or to comply with continuing obligations. So that's a clear post-termination obligation regarding returning property.\n\nThen section 10.8 Survival mentions that certain sections (3.6, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11) survive termination. This means those sections' obligations remain in effect even after the contract ends. For example, section 9 is about confidentiality, so that would still apply. Section 11 includes Dispute Resolution (11.1), which would handle any disputes after termination.\n\nLooking at section 11.1 Dispute Resolution, it states that New York law governs and disputes go to arbitration via JAMS. This is a survival clause as part of section 11, so it's still in effect after termination.\n\nOther parts mention Force Majeure (10.6) and No Waiver (10.6), but those might not directly relate to post-termination obligations. However, the key sections here are 10.7 and 10.8. \n\nThe question also asks about payments, transfer of IP, wind-down, etc. The context doesn't explicitly mention payments or wind-down, but section 10.7 does cover returning property, which includes IP. The survival of sections like 4, 6, 8, etc., might include other obligations. For example, if section 4 deals with payments, then those terms would still apply. However, without seeing the exact content of those sections, I can only go by what's provided. \n\nAdditionally, the context mentions that contracts with a Marketer survive termination (10.1), which could relate to ongoing obligations. Also, the Force Maje",

During the term of the franchise agreement, the franchisee agrees that neither it, its affiliates, nor its owners will have any direct or indirect interest in a \"Competitive Business\" located at the franchise site, within 3 miles of the franchise unit, or within 3 miles of any other Pretzel Time unit in operation or under development (Section 21.A).\n\n2. After termination or expiration of the franchise agreement, the franchisee and its owners agree not to have any direct or indirect interest in a Competitive Business located at the franchise site, within 3 miles of the franchise unit, or within 3 miles of any other Pretzel Time unit in operation or under development for a period of 12 months (Section 20.G).\n\nThe agreement also restricts the franchisee from recruiting or hiring any employees who were employed by Pretzel Time or another Pretzel Time franchisee within the prior 6 months, without Pretzel Time's prior written permission (Section 21.A(2)).\n\nSo in summary, the franchise agreement imposes non-compete and non-solicitation restrictions on the franchisee both during the contract term and for a period after the contract ends.",

The user is asking whether a party is restricted from contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty during or after the contract ends.
