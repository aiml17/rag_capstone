      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking about the duration of any warranty against defects or errors in technology, products, or services provided under the contract. The context given is an amendment to a co-branding agreement between PC Quote, Inc. and A.B. Watley, Inc., effective December 9, 1996. The amendment is to Section 2, Part B, which is titled \"Term.\" The agreement was made effective by both parties, with signatures dated December 5, 1996, and December 12, 1996.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the provided context mentions anything about warranties. The context is an amendment to the Term section. The Term section usually refers to the duration of the contract itself, not necessarily the warranties. However, sometimes warranties can be part of the Term or have their own section. The user is asking specifically about warranties against defects or errors in technology, products, or services. \n\nLooking at the provided text, the context is the amendment to Section 2 (Term) of the Co-Branding Agreement. The amendment is about the term, so it might extend or modify how long the agreement is in effect. However, there's no mention of warranties in the given text. The text includes the parties involved, the effective date, and the signatures, but nothing about warranties or their duration. \n\nSince the question is about the warranty duration, and the provided context doesn't include any information on warranties, the answer would be that the information isn't available in the provided context. The user might need to refer to other sections of the Co-Branding Agreement that specifically address warranties. The amendment here is only about the Term, so unless the Term section was amended to include warranty periods, which isn't indicated here, the answer would be that the duration isn't specified in the given text.\n</think>\n\nThe provided context does not specify the duration of any warranty against defects or errors in technology, products, or services under the contract. The text focuses on an amendment to the \"Term\" section of the Co-Branding Agreement, detailing the parties, effective dates, and signatures, but it does not address warranties or their duration. Further information would require reviewing other sections of the full Co-Branding Agreement or related documents. \n\nAnswer: The duration of any warranty against defects or errors is not specified in the provided context.",

      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the context provided in the Cooperation Agreement, there does not appear to be any uncapped liability for a party's breach of the contract. The agreement does not explicitly state that a party's liability is uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.\n\nThe relevant sections are:\n\n1. Clause 5 on Confidential Information, which states that the obligations of confidentiality shall remain in force until the relevant information enters the public domain otherwise than by the default of a party. This suggests there is no uncapped liability for breach of the confidentiality obligation.\n\n2. Clause 4.1 regarding QIWI's obligation to settle transactions through Otkritie's bank. This clause states that if QIWI terminates this obligation, it shall pay a fee to Otkritie, but this fee is capped at RUB 50,000,000. This indicates a cap on liability for breach of this specific obligation.\n\n3. The agreement does not contain any other provisions that suggest uncapped liability for breach of the contract or specific types of breaches. The dispute resolution clause (Clause 9) also does not indicate uncapped damages.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the Cooperation Agreement, the liability of the parties does not appear to be uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether a party's liability is uncapped if they breach the contract, specifically mentioning IP infringement or breach of confidentiality. The context provided is about confidentiality clauses in a contract.\n\nFirst, I need to check the context for any mention of liability caps. The given clauses (5.1 to 5.4) discuss confidentiality obligations, exceptions to those obligations, and steps to take if disclosure is required by law. However, there's no mention of liability limits or caps. The clauses outline what the parties must do to protect confidential information and under what circumstances they can disclose it, but they don't specify whether there's a cap on damages for breaches.\n\nThe user is asking if the liability is uncapped. Since the context doesn't include any clauses about limiting liability, the default assumption would be that liability isn't capped unless stated otherwise. Contracts often include liability caps, but if they don't, then the parties could be liable for all damages resulting from a breach. However, the answer should be based solely on the provided context. Since there's no mention of liability caps in the given text, the answer would be that the liability isn't capped as per the provided clauses. But I should make sure there's no other part of the contract (not shown here) that might address this. Since the user only provided these clauses, the answer must be based on that.\n</think>\n\nThe provided context does not specify whether a party\u2019s liability is capped or uncapped in the event of a breach, including breaches of confidentiality or IP infringement. The clauses (5.1\u20135.4) focus on defining confidentiality obligations, permitted disclosures, and procedural requirements for handling confidential information. However, **there is no explicit mention of liability caps or exclusions for specific types of breaches** (e.g., IP infringement or confidentiality violations) in the given text. \n\nIn the absence of such language, liability for breaches would generally depend on applicable law and any other terms of the contract not included in the provided context. If the contract as a whole does not limit liability for these breaches, liability could be uncapped. However, based solely on the excerpt, **the answer cannot be definitively determined**\u2014the context neither confirms nor denies the existence of liability caps.",

The context provided is about a sponsorship agreement where the Sponsor has to get certain insurance policies.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the context carefully. The Sponsor is required to obtain and maintain insurance policies at their own expense. The first point is Workers' Compensation in compliance with California law, which includes Employers' Liability with specific minimum limits. Then there's the Commercial General Liability Insurance Policy from an admitted carrier with certain A.M. Best ratings. \n\nLooking further, the Sponsor must name SDBF, Padres LP, the City of San Diego, and their subsidiaries and affiliates as Additional Insureds under the Commercial General Liability, Automobile Liability, and Umbrella Liability Policies. Also, these policies need Cross Liability Endorsements. The Waiver of Subrogation in favor of SDBF is required. \n\nAdditionally, the Sponsor has to provide certificates of insurance before the sponsorship starts and annually. There's a 30-day notice requirement if the insurance is canceled, not renewed, or modified. The Additional Insureds are covered on a primary basis regardless of other insurance. \n\nSo, the key points here are that the Sponsor is maintaining insurance (Workers' Comp and General Liability) which benefits the counterparty (SDBF, Padres LP, etc.) by naming them as Additional Insureds.

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking about the renewal term after the initial term expires, including automatic extensions and unilateral extensions with prior notice.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the provided context. The context mentions that the agreement is in effect until March 18, 2021, unless terminated earlier by either party with 30 days written notice. So the initial term ends on March 18, 2021. But the question is about what happens after that initial term. \n\nLooking through the clauses, there's a lot about termination and what happens if the agreement is terminated. For example, clause 11 says that upon termination, the Distributor can sell the ordered products. But there's no mention of an automatic renewal term. The agreement is set to end on a specific date unless terminated early. The termination clause allows either party to end it with 30 days notice, but that's about ending it before the initial term is up. \n\nI don't see any clause that talks about the agreement automatically renewing after March 18, 2021. The context doesn't mention a renewal term beyond the initial expiration date. The only thing is that if they terminate before the date, they need to give 30 days notice. But after the initial term ends on March 18, 2021, there's no information provided about renewal. The user is asking about the renewal term, but the context doesn't specify any terms for renewal after the initial period. \n\nSo the answer would be that there is no automatic renewal or extension mentioned. The agreement ends on the specified date unless terminated earlier. The user might be expecting a clause about renewal, but it's not present here.

There is no mention of a process for unilaterally extending the agreement or automatic renewal after the initial term expires.

      "question": "Does the contract contain a license grant to a licensee (incl. sublicensor) and the affiliates of such licensee/sublicensor?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "No, the contract does not contain a license grant to a licensee or the affiliates of such licensee. The contract grants Distributor (GLS LLC) a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use and sublicense the Software provided by Airspan, but it does not explicitly grant a license or rights to any affiliates of the Distributor.\n\nSpecifically, Section 11.1 states:\n\n\"Airspan grants Distributor, and Distributor hereby accepts, a nonexclusive, non-transferable license to use, and to sublicense as set forth below, Software provided by Airspan hereunder only on a single System or unit of Equipment, as may be applicable.\"\n\nThere is no mention of affiliates of the Distributor being granted any license or rights to the Software.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the contract contains a license grant to a licensee, including their affiliates. Let me look through the provided context to find relevant sections.\n\nFirst, I remember seeing something about a license in the context. Let me check the pages again. On Page 14, there's a section 11.1 that says Airspan grants Distributor a nonexclusive, non-transferable license to use and sublicense the Software. The key part here is \"sublicense as set forth below,\" but I need to see if there's more detail. However, the context provided cuts off there, so maybe the specifics of the sublicense are in another section not included here.\n\nAlso, looking at Page 1, section 1.1 mentions that Distributor's appointment includes a license to resell Airspan Products in the Territory. But it explicitly states that there's no transfer of rights in the Airspan Software. So the license for the Software is separate from the reselling rights.\n\nSection 10.6 on Page 13 talks about Confidential Information, allowing use only for the Agreement's purposes. That's more about confidentiality than a license grant. \n\nSection 10.12 mentions that Airspan can't compete with Distributor's customers for three months after termination, which is a non-compete clause, not a license. \n\nThe main license grant seems to be in 11.1. The license is nonexclusive and non-transferable. The question is about whether the license includes the licensee's affiliates. The term \"sublicense as set forth below\" in 11.1 might imply that sublicensing is allowed under certain conditions, but the context doesn't show those conditions. However, the license is given to the Distributor, and if the Distributor can sublicense, then their affiliates (as part of the Distributor's structure) might be included. But the license is non-transferable, which could mean that the Distributor can't transfer the license to others, but sublicensing might be a different matter. \n\nWait, the license is non-transferable, so the Distributor can't transfer it to affiliates. However, the sublicense part is a bit unclear. The context says \"subliclicense as set forth below,\" but there's no further info. If the sublicense is allowed, maybe the Distributor can sublicense to affiliates. However, the non-transferable clause might restrict",

The context includes several sections like a Supplement, a Schedule 1 with Tender Notice Delivery Information, and Exhibits B and A which are forms related to Remarketing Notices and Tender Notices. There's also a section with definitions of terms like \"Agreement,\" \"Calculation and Paying Agent,\" etc.\n\nLooking at the beginning of the context, the first line mentions \"6. Terms used herein and not otherwise defined will have the meanings given to such terms in the Supplement.\" This suggests that the main document is referencing a Supplement for definitions. Then, there's a mention of a \"Remarketing Agreement\" in Exhibit B's section. Specifically, in Exhibit B, under the REMARKETING NOTICE, it says: \"Pursuant to [Section 2(d)] [Section 2(e)] [Section 2(f)] of the Remarketing Agreement dated [\u25cf] (the \"Remarketing Agreement\"), by and among Nuveen AMT-Free Municipal Credit Income Fund...\" \n\nThis seems to indicate that the main contract in question is the \"Remarketing Agreement.\" Additionally, in the section with definitions, the term \"Agreement\" is mentioned as having the meaning set forth in the preamble. Looking at the signature page at the end, it's titled \"Signature Page to Remarketing Agreement (NVG Series [\u25cf] MFP).\" \n\nPutting this together, the contract being referred to here is the \"Remarketing Agreement.\" The other parts like the Tender Notice and Remarketing Notice are forms or schedules attached to this main agreement. The key clues are the references to the Remarketing Agreement in multiple sections and the mention of the preamble defining \"Agreement\" as the Remarketing Agreement. \n\nI don't see any other contract names mentioned in the provided context. Terms like \"Tender and Paying Agent Agreement\" are referenced but are part of the definitions, not the main contract's name. The main document is centered around the Remarketing Agreement between the parties listed.\n</think>\n\nThe name of the contract is the **Remarketing Agreement**. This is explicitly referenced in the context as the governing document, with sections and exhibits (e.g., Schedule 1, Exhibit A/B) tied to it.

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether a party is subject to obligations after the termination or expiration of a contract, including things like post-termination transition, payment, transfer of IP, wind-down, last-buy, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context to find relevant sections. The context includes several sections from a contract, specifically sections 10.7, 10.8, 11.1, 10.6, 10.2, and parts of Section 10. Let me go through each one.\n\nStarting with 10.7 Property: It says that upon termination, each party must return the other's property, including proprietary information, within 30 days, unless required by law or continuing obligations. So that's a clear post-termination obligation regarding returning property and IP.\n\nSection 10.8 Survival mentions that certain sections (like 3.6, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11) survive termination. This means those sections' obligations remain in effect even after termination. Since Section 11 includes Miscellaneous provisions like Dispute Resolution (11.1), those would still apply.\n\nLooking at Section 11.1 Dispute Resolution, it's part of the surviving sections, so any disputes after termination would still be handled under that section. Also, the Force Majeure clause in 11.1 (though the user might have misnumbered it as 11.1, but in the context, it's under 11.1?) Wait, the context says Section 11 Miscellaneous includes 11.1 Dispute Resolution, and then there's a part about Force Majeure under 10.6? Wait, no. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the context has a part under 11.1 that says about Force Majeure? Wait, no. Let me recheck. The user's context includes:\n\nSection 11 Miscellaneous 11.1 Dispute Resolution. Then later there's a part about Force Majeure under 10.6? Wait, no. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe context starts with 10.7 Property, then 10.8 Survival, then Section 11 Miscellaneous 11.1 Dispute Resolution. Then later there's a part that says: \"Neither",

      "question": "Is a party restricted from contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty, whether during the contract or after the contract ends (or both)?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, the franchise agreement contains restrictions on the franchisee's ability to compete with Pretzel Time, both during the term of the franchise agreement and after its termination or expiration.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n1. During the term of the franchise agreement, the franchisee agrees that neither it, its affiliates, nor its owners will have any direct or indirect interest in a \"Competitive Business\" located at the franchise site, within 3 miles of the franchise unit, or within 3 miles of any other Pretzel Time unit in operation or under development (Section 21.A).\n\n2. After termination or expiration of the franchise agreement, the franchisee and its owners agree not to have any direct or indirect interest in a Competitive Business located at the franchise site, within 3 miles of the franchise unit, or within 3 miles of any other Pretzel Time unit in operation or under development for a period of 12 months (Section 20.G).\n\nThe agreement also restricts the franchisee from recruiting or hiring any employees who were employed by Pretzel Time or another Pretzel Time franchisee within the prior 6 months, without Pretzel Time's prior written permission (Section 21.A(2)).\n\nSo in summary, the franchise agreement imposes non-compete and non-solicitation restrictions on the franchisee both during the contract term and for a period after the contract ends.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The question is asking whether a party is restricted from contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty during the contract or after it ends, or both. The context provided is a legal document, specifically parts of a franchise agreement.\n\nLooking at the context, there's a mention of a \"covenant not to compete\" that extends beyond the termination of the franchise. The Franchisee and its Owners acknowledge that this covenant is fair and reasonable. Also, there's a part about restrictions not applying to owning shares up to 2% of a listed security. \n\nThe key part here is the covenant not to compete. Typically, such covenants in franchise agreements prevent the franchisee from engaging in competing businesses or soliciting customers, partners, or employees of the franchisor after the contract ends. The mention that the covenant extends beyond termination suggests that the restriction applies even after the contract ends. \n\nAdditionally, the document states that the restrictions are not applicable to owning a small percentage of shares, but that's about ownership in a company, not directly about soliciting customers or partners. The main point is the covenant not to compete, which would likely include restrictions on soliciting customers or partners both during and after the contract. However, the specific answer needs to be based on the provided context.\n\nThe context says the covenant not to compete is acknowledged as fair and reasonable and that it extends beyond termination. Therefore, the answer should indicate that the party is restricted both during and after the contract. The mention of \"other considerable skills\" suggests that the restriction isn't overly broad, but the covenant itself is in place. So the answer is yes, the party is restricted in both scenarios.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: Yes, the party is restricted from contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty both during the contract and after its termination. The Franchise Agreement explicitly includes a covenant not to compete that extends beyond the termination of the franchise. The Franchisee and its Owners acknowledge this covenant as fair and reasonable, recognizing that their skills and opportunities outside the franchise mitigate any undue hardship. While the restrictions do not apply to owning shares (up to 2% of a listed security), the covenant directly prohibits competitive activities, including solicitation, during and after the contract.",

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if there's an exclusive dealing commitment in the provided context. The context is an amendment to a co-branding agreement between PC Quote, Inc. (PCQ) and A.B. Watley, Inc. (ABW). The amendment is about Section 2, Part B, which is titled \"Term.\" The document mentions that the amendment is effective December 9, 1996, and includes signatures from both parties with dates of December 5 and 12, 1996.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what an exclusive dealing commitment entails. It usually means that one party agrees to buy all their needs from the other, or not to deal with others, and vice versa. It could involve prohibitions on selling to third parties or collaborating with others. The question is whether such a commitment exists here.\n\nLooking at the provided context, the main document is an amendment to the Term section.

However, the context doesn't include the actual text of the amendment. The user provided only the title and some signatures, along with the source information.\n\nSince the context is limited to the amendment's title, the parties involved, and the signatures, there's no explicit mention of exclusive dealing terms. The Term section usually doesn't cover exclusivity in dealing; that's more likely in sections about obligations, procurement, or licensing. Without the actual content of the amendment, there's no indication of exclusive commitments. The answer would depend on the content of the amendment, which isn't provided here. Therefore, based solely on the given context, there's no evidence of an exclusive dealing commitment.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: The provided context does not include the specific terms of the amendment to Section 2 (Term) of the Co-Branding Agreement.
