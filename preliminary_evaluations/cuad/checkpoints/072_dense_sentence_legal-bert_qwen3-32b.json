The user is asking about the duration of any warranty against defects or errors in technology, products, or services provided under the contract. The context given is an amendment to a co-branding agreement between PC Quote, Inc. and A.B. Watley, Inc., effective December 9, 1996. The amendment is to Section 2, Part B, which is titled \"Term.\" The agreement was signed by both parties with dates in December 1996.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the provided context mentions anything about warranties. The context here is an amendment to the Term section. The Term section usually outlines the duration of the contract. However, warranties are typically covered in a separate section, often labeled as \"Warranties\" or something similar. The context provided doesn't include any text about warranties. The amendment is about the term, so it's possible that the warranty duration isn't addressed here.\n\nSince the user is asking about the warranty duration, but the given context only discusses an amendment to the Term, there's no information in the provided text that answers the question. The answer would need to be based on the information given, and since there's no mention of warranties in the context, the correct response would be that the information isn't available here.\n</think>\n\nThe provided context does not include any specific information regarding the duration of warranties against defects or errors in technology, products, or services under the contract.

      "question": "Is a party\u2019s liability uncapped upon the breach of its obligation in the contract? This also includes uncap liability for a particular type of breach such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality obligation.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the context provided in the Cooperation Agreement, there does not appear to be any uncapped liability for a party's breach of the contract. The agreement does not explicitly state that a party's liability is uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.\n\nThe relevant sections are:\n\n1. Clause 5 on Confidential Information, which states that the obligations of confidentiality shall remain in force until the relevant information enters the public domain otherwise than by the default of a party. This suggests there is no uncapped liability for breach of the confidentiality obligation.\n\n2. Clause 4.1 regarding QIWI's obligation to settle transactions through Otkritie's bank. This clause states that if QIWI terminates this obligation, it shall pay a fee to Otkritie, but this fee is capped at RUB 50,000,000. This indicates a cap on liability for breach of this specific obligation.\n\n3. The agreement does not contain any other provisions that suggest uncapped liability for breach of the contract or specific types of breaches. The dispute resolution clause (Clause 9) also does not indicate uncapped damages.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the Cooperation Agreement, the liability of the parties does not appear to be uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether a party's liability is uncapped in case of a breach of their obligations under the contract, including specific breaches like IP infringement or confidentiality. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context to see if there's any mention of liability caps or exceptions. The context is a legal agreement between QIWI and Otkritie. Let me scan through the clauses.\n\nLooking at Clause 4.1, there's a mention of a fee that QIWI might have to pay if they terminate their obligation early. The fee is capped at RUB 50,000,000. That's a specific cap for that particular obligation. But the question is about general liability for breaches, not just this specific termination fee.\n\nOther clauses like 3.8 and 3.7 talk about non-binding agreements on certain items and the Steering Committee's role, but not liability. There's also a mention in 4.1 about the fee not exceeding fifty million rubles, which is a cap. However, the user is asking if liability is uncapped in general. \n\nI don't see any other clauses that discuss liability caps or exclusions. The absence of a general liability cap clause in the provided context suggests that unless specified otherwise, liability might not be capped. But the example in 4.1 shows that at least in some cases, there's a cap. However, the question is about whether liability is uncapped in general. Since the context doesn't mention a general cap, and the example given has a cap, but the question is about other breaches like IP or confidentiality, which aren't addressed here. \n\nWait, the user is asking if the liability is uncapped for breaches, including specific ones. The answer would depend on whether the contract has a general liability cap. Since the provided context doesn't mention a general cap, but does have a specific cap in 4.1, but other breaches aren't addressed. So, unless there's a clause elsewhere in the contract (not provided here) that caps liability, the default would be that liability isn't capped. However, the presence of a specific cap in one clause doesn't necessarily mean others are uncapped. \n\nBut the user is asking about the entire contract. Since the context doesn't include a general liability cap, the answer would be that liability isn't capped unless specified otherwise. Therefore, for breaches",

Workers' Compensation insurance with minimum liability limits.\n\n2. An occurrence-based Commercial General Liability Insurance Policy with minimum liability limits.\n\nThe policies must name SDBF, Padres LP, the City of San Diego, and their subsidiary/affiliated companies and directors/officers/employees as Additional Insureds. The policies must also contain Cross Liability Endorsements and a Waiver of Subrogation in favor of SDBF.\n\nSponsor must provide SDBF with certificates of insurance evidencing compliance with these insurance requirements prior to the commencement of the sponsorship and annually prior to the expiration of each required insurance policy.",

I need to check the provided context for any mentions of insurance.\n\nLooking through the context, the first part says, \"All policies shall be endorsed to provide a Waiver of Subrogation in favor of SDBF.\" So that's about insurance policies having a waiver for SDBF. Then it mentions that the Sponsor must provide certificates of insurance to SDBF before the sponsorship starts and annually. That sounds like the Sponsor needs to have insurance in place that covers SDBF, probably liability or something similar. \n\nThe Waiver of Subrogation part is important because it means if there's a loss, the insurance company can't go after SDBF. So the Sponsor is required to have insurance that includes this waiver for SDBF's benefit. Also, the Sponsor has to prove compliance with these insurance provisions by providing certificates. \n\nOther parts of the context talk about payments and approvals, but the insurance requirement is clearly outlined in the first few paragraphs. The key points are the Waiver of Subrogation, the notice in case of cancellation, and the certificates of insurance. \n\nSo yes, there's definitely an insurance requirement here. The Sponsor must maintain insurance with a waiver of subrogation in favor of SDBF and provide proof through certificates. That's the main point.

Let me scan through the sections again.\n\nLooking at section 3.10, it talks about the Distributor not actively promoting or selling Airspan Products outside the Territory without approval. But it allows selling to customers outside the Territory if the request is unsolicited. So that's about distribution, not licensing.\n\nSection 3.12 mentions a National Accounts Consulting Agreement where the Distributor gets consulting fees and commissions for sales. But again, that's about sales, not licensing.\n\nIn the Services section (3.1), the Distributor is supposed to identify customers and project opportunities. Still, no mention of licensing.\n\nLooking at the indemnity section (17.4), there's a part about returning Equipment and Software if Airspan can't perform remedies. The refund is for the depreciated value. But that's about returns, not licensing.\n\nSection 18 says Airspan pays no commissions; the Distributor's compensation is the difference in pricing. Also, the agreement isn't a joint venture. Still no license grant.\n\nThe question is about a license grant to a licensee and their affiliates. The contract mentions the Distributor selling or sublicensing products, but that's under 3.10. However, the key here is whether there's a license grant. The Distributor is allowed to sell or sublicense, but does that imply a license? Or is the license already granted by Airspan to the Distributor?\n\nWait, the contract says \"Airspan Products\" which might be licensed or sold. The Distributor is authorized to sell or sublicense, but the license grant itself would be from Airspan to the Distributor. However, the question is whether the contract contains a license grant to a licensee (the Distributor) and their affiliates. \n\nLooking through the entire context, there's no explicit section where Airspan grants a license to the Distributor. The Distributor is allowed to sell or sublicense, but that's more about distribution rights rather than a license to use the products. The contract refers to \"Airspan Products\" which might be proprietary, so the Distributor's rights are limited to selling them, not necessarily licensing them. \n\nAlso, in section",

The user is asking for the name of the contract, so I need to look through the sections and any other details given.\n\nLooking at the context, there are several sections mentioned like Section 3 (Prospectus; Offering), Section 4 (Representations and Warranties of the Company, the MHC and the Bank), Section 16 (Construction), Section 17 (Counterparts), and Section 18. There's also mention of the MHC Application being approved by the OTS and a Prospectus authorized. \n\nIn Section 2, there's a part about the Company and the Bank retaining an Agent for the distribution of shares. The Agent's role includes consulting, advising, and assisting in the stock offering. The compensation and reimbursement details are also outlined here. \n\nThe document seems to be a legal agreement between the Company, the MHC, the Bank, and the Agent. The sections cover various aspects like the offering process, representations, construction law (Kansas), counterparts, and the role of the Agent. \n\nThe key part might be in the last sentence of the provided context: \"If the foregoing correctly sets forth the arrangement among the Company, the MHC, the Bank and the Agent, please indicate acceptance thereof in the space provided below for that purpose, whereupon this letter and the Agent's acceptance shall constitute a binding agreement.\" This suggests that the document itself is a binding agreement. \n\nLooking at the sections again, Section 17 is titled \"Counterparts\" and mentions that the Agreement can be executed in separate counterparts. The word \"Agreement\" is used here, which is capitalized, indicating it's part of the formal title. \n\nAlso, the context starts with \"Section 3. Prospectus; Offering...\" which implies that the document is structured into sections, typical of a formal contract or agreement. \n\nPutting this together, the name of the contract is likely the \"Agreement\" between the parties involved. But to be more specific, considering the sections and the context of the offering, it might be called the \"Underwriting Agreement\" or \"Stock Offering Agreement.\" However, the exact name isn't explicitly stated in the provided text.

The context seems to be a legal document, possibly a supplement or an agreement related to a fund, given mentions of the Fund, Remarketing Agent, Calculation and Paying Agent, and various sections. \n\nLooking at the beginning of the context, there's a mention of \"Section 2.7(a) of the Supplement\" and later \"Section 3.

Also, there's a part where it says \"Statement\" has the meaning set forth in the preamble, and \"Supplement\" is similarly defined. \n\nThe document also includes sections like \"Section 22.

In legal documents, the contract's name is often mentioned in the preamble or the title. However, the context provided doesn't have a clear title at the top. Instead, looking at the sections and definitions might help. The term \"Supplement\" is used repeatedly, and there's a mention of \"the Supplement\" in the definitions.

The user is asking whether a party has obligations after the termination or expiration of a contract, including things like post-termination transitions, payments, IP transfer, etc. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context to find relevant sections. The context is from a contract's Section 10 and 11, focusing on Term and Termination, and Miscellaneous. \n\nLooking at Section 10.7 Property: It says that upon termination, each party must return the other's property, including proprietary information, within 30 days, except what's required by law or to meet ongoing obligations. So that's a clear post-termination obligation about returning property.\n\nSection 10.8 Survival mentions that certain sections (like 3.6, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11) survive termination. This means those sections' terms remain in effect even after the contract ends. For example, Section 6 includes Regulatory Notices and Recordkeeping, which might involve ongoing duties.\n\nAlso, in 10.1, it says that contracts with Marketers survive termination according to their own terms. So there's a survival of certain agreements. \n\nIn 10.2 Termination for Breach, if there's a material breach not cured, termination can happen. But if the breaching party is trying to cure it, there's an extension. Also, if CAPSUGEL is breached, CARDAX can use their IP for development. That's a post-termination IP transfer scenario.\n\nSection 10.4 (even though not fully visible in the context) might mention termination due to product feasibility issues. The visible part says CARDAX can terminate if development isn't feasible due to legal or technical issues. Then, there's a mention of returning property in 10.7. \n\nSection 11.1 Dispute Resolution is mentioned in Survival (10.8), so dispute resolution processes would still apply after termination. \n\nAlso, 6.5 Recordkeeping requires CAPSUGEL to keep records, which would survive termination as per 10.8. \n\nSo putting it all together: Yes, parties have obligations post-termination. These include returning property (10.7), survival of certain sections (like dispute resolution, records, etc.), possible IP transfer if there's a breach (10.2), and adherence to surviving",

After termination or expiration of the franchise agreement, the franchisee and its owners agree not to have any direct or indirect interest in a Competitive Business located at the franchise site, within 3 miles of the franchise unit, or within 3 miles of any other Pretzel Time unit in operation or under development for a period of 12 months (Section 20.G).\n\nThe agreement also restricts the franchisee from recruiting or hiring any employees who were employed by Pretzel Time or another Pretzel Time franchisee within the prior 6 months, without Pretzel Time's prior written permission (Section 21.A(2)).\n\nSo in summary, the franchise agreement imposes non-compete and non-solicitation restrictions on the franchisee both during the contract term and for a period after the contract ends.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether a party is restricted from contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty during or after the contract ends. I need to check the provided context for any such restrictions.\n\nLooking through the context, there's a section about Confidential Information (20.E) where the Franchisee agrees to stop using confidential info after termination. Then there's a Covenant Not to Compete in 20.G. That section says that after termination or expiration, the Franchisee and Owners can't be involved in a Competitive Business within certain areas for 12 months. \n\nThe Competitive Business is defined as being at the Site, within 3 miles of the Unit, or near other Pretzel Time units. But does this include soliciting customers or partners? The Covenant Not to Compete might imply that they can't set up a competing business, which would involve customers, but the exact wording about soliciting isn't there. \n\nAlso, there's a mention of Confidential Information, which might prevent using that info to contact customers, but the question is about soliciting in general. The Covenant Not to Compete is more about location and ownership, not direct solicitation. The context doesn't explicitly mention restrictions on soliciting customers or partners during the contract term. \n\nSo, based on the provided text, the Covenant Not to Compete applies after termination for 12 months, but it's about not operating a competitive business in certain areas, not necessarily about soliciting. There's no explicit mention of restrictions during the contract period. Therefore, the answer would be that the restrictions apply after the contract ends, specifically regarding not engaging in a competitive business within certain areas, but there's no direct mention of soliciting customers or partners during the contract or after. However, the Covenant Not to Compete might indirectly prevent soliciting if it's part of setting up a competitive business. But the answer should be based strictly on the given context.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: The context provided does not explicitly mention restrictions on soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty during the contract term. However, **after termination or expiration of the Agreement**, the Covenant Not to Compete (20.G) restricts the Franchisee and its Owners from engaging in a \"Competitive Business\" within specified geographic areas for 12 months. This restriction applies to direct or indirect ownership, involvement, or interest in such businesses but does not explicitly address solic",
