      "question": "Is a party\u2019s liability uncapped upon the breach of its obligation in the contract? This also includes uncap liability for a particular type of breach such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality obligation.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the context provided in the Cooperation Agreement, there does not appear to be any uncapped liability for a party's breach of the contract. The agreement does not explicitly state that a party's liability is uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.\n\nThe relevant sections are:\n\n1. Clause 5 on Confidential Information, which states that the obligations of confidentiality shall remain in force until the relevant information enters the public domain otherwise than by the default of a party. This suggests there is no uncapped liability for breach of the confidentiality obligation.\n\n2. Clause 4.1 regarding QIWI's obligation to settle transactions through Otkritie's bank. This clause states that if QIWI terminates this obligation, it shall pay a fee to Otkritie, but this fee is capped at RUB 50,000,000. This indicates a cap on liability for breach of this specific obligation.\n\n3. The agreement does not contain any other provisions that suggest uncapped liability for breach of the contract or specific types of breaches. The dispute resolution clause (Clause 9) also does not indicate uncapped damages.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the Cooperation Agreement, the liability of the parties does not appear to be uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.",
      "generated_response": "Based on the provided context, there is no explicit statement that a party's liability is uncapped upon the breach of its obligation in the contract. However, the contract does not contain any language that limits the liability of the parties for breaches of their obligations.\n\nIn fact, the contract does not contain any specific provisions regarding liability caps or limitations for breaches of confidentiality or intellectual property (IP) infringement. This suggests that the parties may be liable for unlimited damages in the event of a breach of their obligations.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that the contract does not contain any language that explicitly states that the parties' liability is uncapped. Therefore, it is possible that the parties may have intended to limit their liability in some way, but this is not explicitly stated in the contract.\n\nTo determine the parties' liability for breaches of their obligations, it would be necessary to review the contract in its entirety and consider any applicable laws and regulations.",

      "question": "Is there a requirement for insurance that must be maintained by one party for the benefit of the counterparty?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, according to the General Provisions of the Sponsorship Agreement, the Sponsor (Rubio's Fresh Mexican Grill) must obtain and continuously maintain certain insurance policies for the benefit of the counterparty, SDBF (San Diego Ballpark Funding LLC):\n\nSpecifically, Section 8(c) states that Sponsor must obtain and continuously maintain the following insurance policies:\n\n1. Workers' Compensation insurance with minimum liability limits.\n\n2. An occurrence-based Commercial General Liability Insurance Policy with minimum liability limits.\n\nThe policies must name SDBF, Padres LP, the City of San Diego, and their subsidiary/affiliated companies and directors/officers/employees as Additional Insureds. The policies must also contain Cross Liability Endorsements and a Waiver of Subrogation in favor of SDBF.\n\nSponsor must provide SDBF with certificates of insurance evidencing compliance with these insurance requirements prior to the commencement of the sponsorship and annually prior to the expiration of each required insurance policy.",
      "generated_response": "Based on the provided context, there is no explicit requirement for insurance that must be maintained by one party for the benefit of the counterparty in the Sponsorship Agreement. However, it is worth noting that the General Provisions are incorporated into the Agreement, but the specific details of the General Provisions are not provided in the given context.\n\nIf we were to look at the typical General Provisions for sponsorship agreements, it is common to see clauses requiring one party to maintain certain types of insurance, such as liability insurance, to protect the other party in case of certain events or accidents. However, without access to the full General Provisions, it is impossible to confirm whether such a requirement exists in this specific agreement.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the Agreement does not contain any language that explicitly requires one party to maintain insurance for the benefit of the counterparty. Therefore, based on the provided context, it appears that there is no requirement for insurance that must be maintained by one party for the benefit of the counterparty.",

APPOINTMENT.      -----------\n\n1.1  Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, Airspan hereby appoints Distributor as an independent, exclusive distributor to assist Airspan in marketing the Airspan Products to customers in the Territory, and Distributor hereby accepts such appointment as of the Effective Date of this Agreement. Distributor's appointment as a distributor of the Airspan Products grants to Distributor only a license to resell the\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 1\n\nAirspan Products to Distributor's customers in the Territory, and does not transfer any right, title, or interest in any of the Airspan Software to Distributor.\n\n1.2  Distributor's relationship to Airspan is that of an independent contractor, and nothing in this Agreement shall constitute Distributor as the agent or employee of Airspan.  Distributor shall have no authority to accept any order or make any offer (except as herein stated), or execute any instrument or make any commitment on behalf of Airspan.  Specifically, without in any way limiting the generality of the foregoing, Distributor agrees not to make any representation, guarantee, or warranty on Airspan's behalf concerning the Airspan Products, but will refer customers to Airspan's printed literature. Nothing contained in this Agreement is to be construed as a limitation or restriction upon Airspan in the sale or other disposition of any of its products to any person, firm, or corporation inside or outside of the Territory. Airspan will pay no commissions under this Agreement.  Distributor's compensation is to be obtained solely by the difference between the price Distributor pays to Airspan and the price Distributor charges its customers. The parties also acknowledge that this Agreement is not intended to create a joint venture or partnership between Airspan and Distributor.\n\n1.3  Distributor will use its best efforts to maintain and support the Airspan Products within the Territory by devoting such attention, time, and effort as may be reasonably necessary to fully develop the available market potential.

Distributor will give Airspan thirty (30) days' prior, written notice of each new potential representation role being considered by Distributor, and Distributor will not undertake such representation without Airspan's prior, written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. Except as\n\n\n\n\n\nprovided above, in no event will Airspan consent to Distributor's consultation for or representation of a manufacturer or supplier, which is directly or indirectly, a competitor of Airspan.\n\n1.4  Distributor shall maintain a place of business at the location specified in Section 21.10 where Distributor can be contacted by Airspan, customers, and prospective customers during regular business hours with a permanent mailing address and an accessible cellular telephone, and will provide Airspan with written notice promptly upon any change in address.  Distributor agrees to assume all of the expenses of this place of business, including rent, stenographic services, and all other expenses except as specifically assumed in writing by Airspan.\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 2\n\n1.5  Airspan will provide Distributor with such commercial and technical assistance and training as may reasonably be necessary, in Airspan's sole judgment, to enable Distributor to effectively carry out its activities under this Agreement and, in connection therewith, to provide such sales promotional materials, as Airspan may deem appropriate.  Airspan will provide such technical support as is reasonable and necessary to maintain the product line as a viable competitor in the market.\n\n2.

Confidential treatment has been requested with respect to the omitted portions.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 7\n\nAirspan warrants that during the term of this Agreement, the prices at      which Airspan sells to Distributor products supplied under this Agreement      shall be no less favorable to the Distributor than those prices at which      Airspan sells, at substantially the same time in the United States, similar      products and pursuant to similar terms and conditions as those by which      Airspan sells Products to the Distributor under this Agreement.  Products      shall only be deemed similar if they provide like functionality.  The terms      and conditions shall only be deemed similar if the product is supplied      pursuant to an agreement or arrangement of similar duration and commitment,      provides for similar warranties and after service commitments, involves      similar spare part and support commitments, has the same payment and other      financial terms, and otherwise has similar terms and conditions.\n\n6.2  The Contract Price is shown in Schedule IV and shall include      applicable duties, taxes or imposts, including all export or import duties.      Sales taxes and contractor's excise taxes shall be itemized on all Purchase      Orders.  The parties agree that the Contract Price in Schedule IV shall be      firm for a minimum period of twenty-four (24) months from the Effective      Date. After the above period of twenty-four (24) months, Exhibit B may be      revised by Airspan giving thirty (30) days written notice to Distributor.\n\n7.  PAYMENT TERMS.\n\n\n\n\n\n7.1  Airspan will issue an invoice (the \"Invoice\") to Distributor in      accordance with the payment terms below. The Invoice specifically will      identify the Equipment, Software, or other items shipped, and the Contract      Price of such items.  Any Installation Services or other services provided      by Airspan will be invoiced separately following completion of such      services.  The Invoice also shall state the total due to Airspan from      Distributor (the \"Invoice Total\"), which shall include the Contract Price,      and any applicable taxes, duties, and other fees due pursuant to Section 6      of this Agreement. Payment of the Invoice Total is due (without any right      of set-off) Net forty-five (45) days after the date of invoice.\n\n7.2  If Distributor disputes any invoice or part thereof, Distributor      must notify Airspan in writing within twenty-five (25) days of the invoice      date giving details of the reason for such dispute.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 8\n\nDistributor and Airspan agree to work together in good faith to resolve the      dispute as quickly as possible. Distributor may withhold payment of such      disputed amounts until resolution of the dispute. Any parts of the invoice      not under dispute shall be paid net forty-five (45) days after the date of      invoice. On resolution of the dispute, Distributor shall immediately pay      any amounts due in full.\n\n7.3  Distributor will make payment by wire or telegraphic transfer to      the bank account set forth below or, on receipt of written notification      from Airspan, to another designated bank within the United States.\n\nBank:            Seafirst Bank, 10555 N.E. 8th, Bellevue, WA98004, USA.      Account name:    Airspan Networks Inc.      Account number:  68777507      Routing Number:  125 - 0000 - 24      Further instructions: \"Reference (Distributor's name), Purchase Order      number, Payment of Invoice number\"\n\nPayment will be deemed to have been made upon receipt of funds in Airspan's      bank.\n\n7.4  If the cost to Airspan of performing this Agreement increases as a      result of any change to the law or increase in import duty or freight duty,      Airspan may, at any time, add such increase to the Contract Price by      notifying Distributor in writing of such increase.\n\n8.   DELIVERY, TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS.\n\n8.1  All Equipment and Software will be delivered by Airspan CIP (as      defined in Incoterms 2000) to an airport in South Dakota that completes      international customs clearances and shipped to a location within the city      limits of the above arrival airport, such airport and delivery location are      to be agreed upon in writing by the parties for each Purchase Order.      Airspan will be responsible for and pay all packing, shipping, freight, and      insurance charges to the agreed upon location within the city limits. If      requested by Distributor, Airspan may arrange for shipment to be made to      Distributor's identified warehouse facilities or freight forwarder outside      of the city limits, subject to approval in writing by Airspan and agreement      to any additional charges in advance of shipment.  Unless specified in the      Purchase Order, Airspan will select the mode of shipment and the carrier.\n\nIn this Agreement, \"Incoterms\" means the most recent international rules      for the interpretation of trade terms published by the International      Chamber of Commerce as in force on the Effective Date.  Unless the context      otherwise requires, any term or expression which is defined in or given a      particular meaning by the provisions of the Incoterms shall have the same      meaning in this\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 9\n\nAgreement, but if there is any conflict between the provisions of the      Incoterms and this Agreement, the latter shall prevail.\n\n8.2 All risk of loss or damage to the Equipment and Software will pass to      Distributor on collection by the freight forwarder from Airspan. However,      Airspan will insure the Equipment against loss or damage in transit to the      agreed to location as set forth in the Purchase Order within the city      limits of the arrival airport as set forth in Paragraph 8.1.\n\n8.3 Title to the Equipment shall pass to Distributor on collection by the      freight forwarder from Airspan.\n\n8.4  If Distributor has any Airspan owned Equipment in its possession:\n\na.   Distributor shall ensure that Equipment is clearly marked as the      property of Airspan, and if asked, shall inform any third parties that the      Equipment is the property of Airspan;\n\nb.   Distributor shall not purport to create any security, mortgage, lien      or pledge over the Equipment, or otherwise deal with the Equipment without      Airspan's written consent;\n\n\n\n\n\nc.   In the event of any threatened seizure of the Equipment by any third      parties, and on termination or expiration of this Agreement, or any      Contract made pursuant to it, Airspan shall have the right, without      prejudice to any other remedy, to enter without prior notice any premises      and to repossess and take away or otherwise deal with the Equipment.\n\n8.5  The Software shall at all times remain the exclusive property of      Airspan, subject to the uses provided herein.\n\n8.6  Unless Distributor clearly advises Airspan to the contrary in      writing, Airspan may make partial deliveries on account of Purchase Orders.      Delay in delivery of any installment shall not relieve Distributor of its      obligation to accept said installment, provided that said delay does not      exceed sixty (60) days from Airspan's scheduled ship date and unless      Distributor has clearly advised Airspan to cancel the delayed installment      in writing at least fifteen (15) days prior to its revised planned shipment      date or its actual shipment date by Airspan.\n\n8.7  Airspan will use reasonable efforts to meet Distributor's requested      delivery schedules for Equipment and Software, but Airspan reserves the      right to refuse, or delay delivery to Distributor when Distributor's credit      is impaired,\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 10\n\nwhen Distributor is delinquent in payments or fails to meet other credit or      financial requirements reasonably established by Airspan, or when      Distributor has failed to perform its obligations under this Agreement.\n\n8.8  Should orders for Equipment and Software exceed Airspan's available      inventory, Airspan will allocate its available inventory and make      deliveries on a basis that Airspan deems equitable, in its sole discretion,      and without liability to Distributor on account of the method of allocation      chosen or its implementation.  In any event, Airspan shall not be liable      for any direct, indirect, consequential, or special losses or damages      (including, but not limited to, loss of income or profit and loss of data)      that may be suffered by the Distributor or by any other person for failure      to deliver or for any delay or error in delivery of Equipment or Software      for any reason whatsoever.\n\n9.   TRADEMARKS AND COPYRIGHTS.\n\n9.1  Distributor acknowledges Airspan's exclusive right, title, and interest in and to any trademarks, trade names, logos and designations which Airspan may at any time have adopted, used, or registered in the United States of America and in the Territory (the \"Trademarks\"), and will not at any time do or cause to be done any act or thing contesting or in any way impairing or tending to impair any part of said right, title, and interest.  In connection with any reference to the Trademarks, Distributor shall not in any manner represent that it has an ownership interest in the Trademarks or registration(s) thereof, and Distributor acknowledges that no action by it or on its behalf shall create in Distributor's favor any right, title, or interest in or to the Trademarks.\n\n9.2  Distributor recognizes the validity of Airspan's copyright in any written material to which Airspan shall have made a claim to copyright protection, and Distributor specifically recognizes Airspan's exclusive right to copyright protection and/or registration of any translation of any advertising, promotional, or descriptive material furnished to Distributor by Airspan.\n\n9.3  Whenever Distributor refers to the Trademarks in advertising or in any other manner to identify the products, Distributor shall clearly indicate Airspan's ownership of the Trademarks and before distributing or publishing any advertising, descriptive, or promotional materials, Distributor shall affirmatively provide Airspan with an opportunity to inspect and approve such materials.\n\n9.4  Distributor agrees that when referring to the Trademarks, it shall diligently comply with all laws pertaining to the Trademarks at any time in force in the Territory.\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 11\n\n9.5  Distributor shall promptly notify Airspan of any and all infringements, imitations, illegal uses, or misuses of the Trademarks which come to Distributor's attention.  Distributor also agrees that it shall not at any time take any action in the courts or before the administrative agencies of the Territory or otherwise to prevent the infringement, imitation, illegal use, or misuse of the Trademarks, it being clearly understood by Distributor that such action falls wholly within the authority of Airspan as sole owner of the Trademarks.\n\n9.6  Distributor agrees to render to Airspan all assistance in connection with any matter pertaining to the protection of the Trademarks, whether in the courts or before the administrative agencies of the Territory or otherwise, and to make promptly available to Airspan, its Distributors, and attorneys all of Distributor's files, records, and other information pertaining to the\n\n\n\n\n\nadvertising, promotion, and sale of the Airspan Products.  All assistance requested by Distributor in this paragraph shall be at AIRSPAN's expense.  This Expense includes costs, attorneys' and consultants' fees, and reimbursement of time spent by officers, agents and employees of Distributor.\n\n9.7  Distributor agrees and undertakes that it will not at any time, whether during the term of this Agreement or after its expiration or termination, adopt, use, or register without Airspan's prior, written consent any work or symbol or combination thereof which is similar to any of the Trademarks.\n\n9.8 In the advertising and sale of Airspan Products, Distributor may use the Trademarks in relation to those Airspan Products.  Distributor will not make or permit the alteration or removal of any tags, labels, or other identifying marks placed by Airspan on Airspan Products.  Distributor will not use or give any third party permission to use the Trademarks. Distributor will not use, or give any third party permission to use, the names \"Airspan Communications Ltd.\", \"Airspan Networks Incorporated\", \"ACL\", \"ANI\" or abbreviations or derivations thereof in Distributor's corporate titles, or in any way which might result in confusion as to Airspan and Distributor being separate and distinct entities. Distributor admits Airspan's exclusive ownership of the name \"Airspan Networks Incorporated\", \"Airspan Communications Ltd.\", \"ANI\", \"ACL\", and any abbreviations or derivations thereof and all of Airspan's Trademarks (whether registered or not).  Distributor shall not take any action inconsistent with Airspan's ownership of such Trademarks; therefore, Distributor shall treat all of Airspan's items distinctively (as to typography) and shall only use exact reproductions of all Airspan's symbols (including Airspan's logo).   Distributor shall not adopt or use any Trademark or product name which may be confusingly similar to any Airspan Trademark.  Distributor may use the Airspan logo as it appears on Airspan's letterhead.\n\n10.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND TRADE SECRETS.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 12\n\n10.1  In this Agreement, the term \"Confidential Information\" shall mean the information of Airspan disclosed to Distributor in connection with its performance under this Agreement, which is in written, recorded, photographic, machine-readable, or other physical form or oral information reduced to writing as soon as practicable after disclosure to Distributor, and which is conspicuously marked \"Confidential\", \"Proprietary\", \"Private\", or in any other manner indicating its confidential and/or proprietary nature.  Without limitation, Confidential Information includes:  (1) Airspan's software products, materials, data reports, programs, documentation, diagrams, and all related technical information; (2) all information relating to Airspan's business and products which is critical to Airspan's position in the marketplace, including future plans of Airspan relating to the fields of endeavor in which Distributor performs services for Airspan, the nature of certain work projects to which Distributor is exposed, and the identity of persons working on those projects; and (3) any improvements, enhancements, or modifications to the above made by or on behalf of Airspan during the performance under this Agreement which are provided, made available, or disclosed by or on behalf of Airspan to Distributor, or used by Airspan or any of Airspan's other Distributors in connection with their own sales activities.\n\n10.2  Trade secrets are confidential information that includes ideas, concepts, techniques, processes, inventions, knowledge, and know-how developed by Airspan which:  (1) derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use; and (2) is subject to the efforts of Airspan that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.  (This \"trade secret\" language comes from the Uniform Trade Secrets Act.)\n\n10.3  Distributor covenants and agrees that it will use the Confidential Information solely for the performance of services under this Agreement, and shall not disclose such Confidential Information to any other person (including Airspan employees in any other division, group, or entity), firm, or corporation.\n\n10.4  Distributor shall use the same degree of care in safeguarding the Confidential Information as it uses for its own confidential information of like importance, but no less than reasonable care.  Upon discovery of any disclosure or misuse of Confidential Information, Distributor shall endeavor to prevent any further disclosure or misuse.\n\n10.5  All Confidential Information shall remain the property of Airspan, and such Confidential Information and all copies thereof shall promptly be returned to Airspan upon request or, at Airspan 's option, destroyed, in which case Airspan shall be notified in writing when it has been destroyed.\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 13\n\n10.6  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as granting to or conferring upon Distributor any rights, by license or otherwise, express or implied, in Airspan's Confidential Information, other than the right to use the Confidential Information for the purpose of this Agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n10.7  Any copies of the Confidential Information made by Distributor shall reproduce proprietary marking and legends included therein, but the provisions of this Agreement supersede any provisions of such legends inconsistent herewith.\n\n10.8  The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall not be disclosed by Distributor to others, except with the prior, written consent of Airspan, or as may be required by law or as necessary to establish its rights hereunder.\n\n10.9  If, in connection with its performance, Distributor discloses to Airspan any ideas, developments, or inventions conceived or actually reduced to practice by Distributor prior to its performance hereunder, no relationship, confidential or otherwise, express or implied, is established with Airspan by the disclosure thereof.  With respect to any such disclosure, no obligation of any kind is assumed by nor may be implied against Airspan, its subsidiary, or associated companies unless a formal, separate, written contract regarding the subject of disclosure is consummated by the parties, and then the obligation shall be only as expressed in the separate contract.\n\n10.10  Distributor agrees that any breach of the provisions of this Section by Distributor or Distributor's personnel, agents, or subcontractors, or any third party providing products or services to Distributor will cause immediate and irreparable injury to Airspan and that, in the event of such breach, Airspan shall be entitled to injunctive relief and any and all other remedies available at law or in equity.\n\n10.11  After Distributor has received Airspan's Confidential Information and know-how, it will be impossible to segregate Airspan's knowledge and know- how from other knowledge acquired independently by Distributor.  Accordingly, during the performance of this Agreement and for three (3) months after termination of services under this Agreement, Distributor will not offer services to third parties which compete with the services provided by Airspan under this Agreement, or otherwise use the knowledge acquired from Airspan in order to compete with Airspan or its customers.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary above, Distributor is not precluded from any activities which concern product sectors or industries other than those that concern products or services similar to those offered by Airspan in connection with this Agreement.  Nothing in this paragraph will be construed to prevent Distributor from providing service to existing customers of Distributor which would result in their interruption of service to the public.\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 14\n\n10.12 During the performance of this Agreement and for three (3) months after termination of services under this Agreement, Airspan will not offer products or services to third parties which compete with the products or services provided by Distributor under this Agreement, or otherwise use the knowledge acquired from Distributor in order to compete with Distributor its customers\n\n10.13 The obligations of this Section 10 shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement.\n\n11.  SOFTWARE LICENSE.\n\n11.1 Airspan grants Distributor, and Distributor hereby accepts, a nonexclusive, non-transferable license to use, and to sublicense as set forth below, Software provided by Airspan hereunder only on a single System or unit of Equipment, as may be applicable.  No license is granted to use the Software on multiple Systems or in conjunction with Equipment furnished by a party other than Airspan, unless specifically agreed to in writing by Airspan.  Software licensed under this Agreement is defined as: (a) any digital instruction sequence or control data contained on any media, including but not limited to, any magnetic-, electronic-, optical-, or organic device, and the term Software shall include any enhancement, modification, extension, part, portion or expansion thereof or implementation or downloading from network of any of the foregoing, for use exclusively on a System or a unit of Equipment; and (b) all associated documentation used to describe, maintain and use the Software.\n\n11.2 Any Software provided to Distributor by Airspan will be treated as the exclusive property of Airspan, and Distributor will:  (a) treat such Software as Confidential Information under Section 10 of this Agreement; (b) utilize such Software or any portions or aspects thereof (including any methods or concepts utilized therein) solely on Systems or Equipment provided by Airspan; (c) forthwith return to Airspan all memory media, documentation and/or other material that has been modified, updated or replaced; (d) except to the extent permitted by applicable law not modify, disassemble or decompile such Software, or reverse engineer any portion of the Software or functioning of Systems or Equipment, or permit others to do so, without Airspan's prior written consent; (e) except to the extent permitted by applicable law not reproduce or copy such Software in whole or in part except for backup and archival purposes or as otherwise permitted in writing by Airspan; (f) not perform or release benchmarks or other comparisons of the Software; and (g) not remove any trademark, tradename, copyright, notice or other proprietary notice from the Software and Distributor shall be responsible for the conservation of the same on any back-up copy of the Software.\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 15\n\n\n\n\n\n11.3 In the event of a breach of this license by Distributor, then Airspan may, in its discretion, terminate the license with immediate effect, whereupon Distributor shall return to Airspan all Software and copies thereof within ten (10) days.\n\n12        EXCUSABLE DELAY.\n\nAirspan shall not suffer any liability for non-performance, defective performance, or late performance under this Agreement due to causes beyond its control and without its fault or negligence such as, but not limited to, acts of God, war (including civil war), civil unrest, acts of government, fire, floods, explosions, the elements, epidemics, quarantine, restrictions, strikes, lock- outs, plant shutdown, material shortages, or delays in transportation or delays of its suppliers or subcontractors for like cause.\n\nIn the event of excusable delay as defined in the preceding sentence, then Airspan, upon giving prompt written notice to Distributor, shall be excused from such performance on a day-to-day basis to the extent of such prevention, restriction, or interference (and Distributor shall likewise be excused from performance of its obligations on a day-to-day basis to the extent Distributor's obligations relate to the performance so prevented, restricted, or interfered with), provided that Airspan shall use its best endeavors to avoid or remove such causes of non-performance and both parties shall proceed to perform with dispatch whenever such causes are removed or cease to exist.\n\n13.  TERM AND TERMINATION.\n\n13.1  This Agreement shall remain in effect for sixty (60) months from the Effective Date (the \"Initial Term\"). After the Initial Term, the term of the Agreement may be extended by a further period of five (5) years by mutual written agreement by the parties in the form of an amendment to this Agreement. If Distributor wishes to extend the term of the Agreement beyond the Initial Term, it  must notify Airspan in writing at least six (6) months prior to then end of the Initial Term. However, nothing contained herein shall be interpreted as requiring either party to renew or extend this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this section or of any other provisions of this Agreement, this Agreement may be terminated prior to the expiration of its stated term as set forth below.\n\n13.2  Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time during the term of this Agreement if  either party fails materially to comply with any covenant, term, or provision of this Agreement, by written notice given to the other party not less than thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of such termination. Either party's right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 13.2 may not be exercised unless said\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 16\n\nparty shall have given the other party written notice of the failure, and the other party has not cured the failure within the thirty (30) day period following notice from said party.\n\n13.3  This Agreement terminates automatically for just cause, with no further act or action of either party if:  (a) a receiver is appointed for Distributor or its property; (b) Distributor&sbsp;makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors; (c) any proceedings are commenced by, for, or against Distributor under any bankruptcy, insolvency, or debtor's relief law; or (d) Distributor is liquidated, dissolved, or otherwise terminates its activities.\n\n13.4 In the event of termination by either party for any reason, Distributor shall provide Airspan with lists of existing customers as well as other information necessary for an orderly changeover of representation in the Territory.\n\n13.5  Upon termination, Distributor shall immediately return to Airspan all Confidential Information, and Distributor agrees that neither it nor any company or organization controlled or directed by it shall divulge the contents of such material to any person at any time, notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement.\n\n13.6 Airspan shall not be liable to Distributor for damages of any kind, including incidental or consequential damages, on account of the termination of this agreement in accordance with this section 13.  Airspan shall not be liable to Distributor on account of termination or expiration of this Agreement for reimbursement or damages for loss of goodwill, prospective profits, or anticipated orders, or on account of any expenditures, investments, leases, or commitments made by either party, or for any other reason whatsoever based upon or growing out of such termination or expiration.  Airspan will recognize payments due to Distributor for orders received up to ninety (90) days after the termination or expiration of this Agreement.\n\n13.7  Distributor acknowledges and agrees that: (a) Distributor has no expectation and has received no assurances that its business relationship with Airspan will continue beyond the states term of this agreement or its earlier termination in accordance with this section, that any investment by Distributor in the promotion of Airspan's Products will be recovered or recouped, or that Distributor shall obtain any anticipated amount of profits by virtue of this Agreement; and (b) Distributor shall not have or acquire by virtue of this Agreement or otherwise any vested, proprietary, or other right in the promotion of Airspan's Products or in any goodwill created by its efforts hereunder.\n\n\n\n\n\n13.8  This Section 13.8, as well as the provisions of Sections 9, 10, 11, 16, 17 and 18, shall survive the termination of this Agreement.\n\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPage 17\n\n14.  WARRANTY.\n\n14.1 THE WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN SECTIONS 14 AND 15 OF THIS AGREEMENT ARE IN LIEU OF, AND Airspan HEREBY DISCLAIMS, ALL OTHER WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED TERMS AND WARRANTIES OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\n\n14.2 Subject to Sections 14.3 and 14.4, Airspan warrants that the Equipment sold to Distributor under this Agreement shall, under normal use and service, be free from defects in materials and faulty workmanship, and that the Software licensed to Distributor under this Agreement shall conform in all material respects to Airspan's published specifications therefor.

(the \"Agent\"), as follows:\n\n         Section 1. The  Offering.  In accordance  with the Stock  Issuance Plan adopted by its Board of Directors (the \"Plan\"),  the Company will offer and sell up to  1,101,643  shares of its common  stock,  par  value,  $.01 per share (the \"Shares\" or \"Common  Stock\"),  in a  subscription  offering  (the  \"Subscription Offering\") to (1) depositors of the Bank with account balances of $50.00 or more as of September 30, 1998 (\"Eligible  Account  Holders\"),  (2) the Employee Stock Ownership Plan of the Bank (the \"ESOP\"), (3) depositors of the Bank with account balances  of $50.00 or more as of  December  31,  1999  (\"Supplemental  Eligible Account Holders\"), and (4) employees, officers and directors of the Bank. To the extent  Shares  remain  unsold in the  Subscription  Offering,  the  Company  is offering for sale in a community  offering  (the  \"Community  Offering\" and when referred to together  with the  Subscription  Offering,  the  \"Subscription  and Community  Offering\")  the  Shares  not  so  subscribed  for or  ordered  in the Subscription Offering to members of the general public, with preference given to natural persons residing in the New Mexico counties of Otero and Lincoln\n\n(\"Other Subscribers\"),  (all such offerees being referred to in the aggregate as \"Eligible  Offerees\").  It is anticipated  that shares not subscribed for in the Subscription  and Community  Offering will be offered to certain  members of the general  public on a best efforts basis through a selected  dealers  arrangement (the \"Syndicated  Community  Offering\") (the  Subscription  Offering,  Community Offering and Syndicated  Community Offering are collectively  referred to as the \"Offering\").  It is acknowledged  that the purchase of Shares in the Offering is subject to the maximum and minimum purchase limitations as described in the Plan and that the Company and the Bank may  reject,  in whole or in part,  any orders received in the Community Offering or Syndicated Community Offering. The Company will  issue the Shares at a  purchase  price of $10.00 per share (the  \"Purchase Price\").\n\n         The Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange  Commission (the \"Commission\")  a  registration  statement  on Form  S-1  (File  No.  333- ) (the \"Registration  Statement\")  containing a prospectus relating to the Offering for the  registration  of the  Shares  under the  Securities  Act of 1933 (the \"1933 Act\"),  and has filed such amendments  thereof and such amended  prospectuses as may have been  required to the date hereof.  The term  \"Registration  Statement\" shall  include  all  exhibits  thereto,  as  amended,  including  post-effective amendments.  The prospectus, as amended, on file with the Commission at the time the Registration  Statement initially became effective is hereinafter called the \"Prospectus,\"  except that if any Prospectus is filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 424(b) or (c) of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the 1933 Act (the \"1933 Act  Regulations\")  differing  from the prospectus on file at the time  the  Registration   Statement   initially  becomes  effective,   the  term \"Prospectus\"  shall refer to the prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) or (c) from and after the time said prospectus is filed with the Commission.\n\n         In accordance  with Title 12, Parts 575 and 563b of the Code of Federal Regulations  (the \"MHC  Regulations\"),  the Company has filed with the Office of Thrift  Supervision (the \"OTS\") an Application on Form MHC-2 with respect to the stock  issuance  (the  \"MHC  Application\"),  including  the  Prospectus  and the Valuation  Appraisal Report prepared by RP Financial,  LC (the  \"Appraisal\") and has filed such amendments  thereto as may have been required by the OTS. The MHC Application  has been  approved by the OTS and the related  Prospectus  has been authorized for use by the OTS.\n\n\n\n\n\n         Section 2.

Subject to the terms and conditions  herein set forth,  the Company and the Bank have retained the Agent to consult with and to advise the Bank, the MHC and the Company,  and to assist the Company,  on a best  efforts  basis,  in the distribution  of the shares of Common Stock in the  Offering.

It is  acknowledged  by the Company, the MHC and the Bank that the Agent  shall not be  required  to take or purchase any Shares or be  obligated to take any action  which is  inconsistent  with all applicable laws, regulations, decisions or orders.\n\n         The  obligations of the Agent  pursuant to this  Agreement  (other than those set forth in  Sections  2(d),  8 and 9 hereof)  shall  terminate  upon the completion  or  termination  or  abandonment  of the Plan by the Company or upon termination  of the  Offering,  but in no event  later  than the date  (the \"End Date\") which is 45 days after the Closing  Date (as  hereinafter  defined).  All fees or  expenses  due to the Agent but  unpaid  will be payable to the Agent in next day funds at the earlier of the Closing  Date (as  hereinafter  defined) or the End Date.  In the event the  Offering is extended  beyond the End Date,  the Company, the MHC, the Bank and the Agent may agree to renew this Agreement under mutually acceptable terms.\n\n         In the event the Company is unable to sell a minimum of 708,050  Shares within the period  herein  provided,  this  Agreement  shall  terminate  and the Company shall refund to any persons who have  subscribed  for any of the Shares, the full amount which it may have  received  from them plus accrued  interest as set forth in the  Prospectus;  and none of the parties to this  Agreement  shall have any obligation to the other parties hereunder,  except as set forth in this Section 2 and in Sections 6, 8 and 9 hereof.\n\n         In the event the Offering is terminated,  the Agent shall be reimbursed for its actual accountable out-of-pocket expenses.\n\n         If all  conditions  precedent  to  the  consummation  of the  Offering, including, without limitation, the sale of all Shares required by the Plan to be sold, are satisfied,  the Company  agrees to issue,  or have issued,  the Shares sold in the Offering and to release for delivery certificates for such Shares on the Closing Date (as hereinafter  defined) against payment to the Company by any means authorized by the Plan; provided, however, that no funds shall be released to the Company  until the  conditions  specified  in Section 7 hereof shall have been  complied  with to the  reasonable  satisfaction  of the  Agent  and  their counsel.  The release of Shares against payment therefor shall be made on a date and at a place  acceptable  to the  Company,  the MHC,  the Bank and the  Agent. Certificates  for  shares  shall be  delivered  directly  to the  purchasers  in accordance with their directions.

The discussion                of  statutes  or  regulations  described  or  referred  to in the                Prospectus   are  accurate   summaries  and  fairly  present  the                information   required  to  be  shown.  The  information  in  the                Prospectus relating to the tax consequences of the stock offering                has been  reviewed  by such  counsel  and  fairly  describes  the                opinions  rendered  by Luse Lehman  Gorman  Pomerenk & Schick and                _____________________  to the Company,  the MHC and the Bank with                respect to such matters.\n\n                    (xxiii) The  Company  and the MHC have been duly  registered                and are in good  standing as savings and loan  holding  companies                under the HOLA.\n\n                    (xxiv) In addition, such counsel shall state that during the                preparation of the MHC Application,  the  Registration  Statement                and the Prospectus, they participated in conferences with certain                officers of, the independent public and internal accountants for,                and other  representatives of the Company,  the MHC and the Bank,                at which  conferences  the contents of the MHC  Application,  the                Registration  Statement and the  Prospectus  and related  matters                were  discussed  and,  while such counsel have not  confirmed the                accuracy or completeness of or otherwise verified the information                contained in the MHC Application,  the Registration  Statement or                the  Prospectus,  and do not assume any  responsibility  for such                information,   based  upon  such  conferences  and  a  review  of                documents deemed relevant for the purpose of rendering their view                (relying as to materiality as to factual  matters on certificates                of officers and other factual representations by the Company, the                MHC and the Bank), nothing has come to their attention that would                lead them to believe that the MHC  Application,  the Registration                Statement, the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto                (other than the  financial  statements,  the notes  thereto,  and                other tabular, financial, statistical and appraisal data included                therein as to which no view need be rendered) contained an untrue                statement of a material  fact or omitted to state a material fact                required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements                therein,  in light of the  circumstances  under  which  they were                made, not misleading.\n\n         In giving such opinion, such counsel may rely as to all matters of fact on  certificates  of officers or directors of the Company,  the MHC and the Bank and certificates of public officials. The opinion of Luse Lehman Gorman Pomerenk & Schick  shall be  governed  by the  Legal  Opinion  Accord  (\"Accord\")  of the American  Bar  Association  Section of  Business  Law (1991).  The term  \"Actual Knowledge\"  as used herein  shall have the meaning set forth in the Accord.  For purposes of such opinion, no proceedings shall be deemed to be pending, no order or stop order shall be deemed to be issued,  and no action shall be deemed to be instituted unless, in each case, a director or executive officer of the Company, the MHC or the Bank shall have received a copy of such\n\n                                       27\n\nproceedings,  order,  stop order or action.  In  addition,  such  opinion may be limited to present  statutes,  regulations and judicial  interpretations  and to\n\n\n\n\n\nfacts as they  presently  exist;  in rendering  such opinion,  such counsel need assume no  obligation  to revise or  supplement  it should the  present  laws be changed by legislative or regulatory action, judicial decision or otherwise; and such counsel need express no view, opinion or belief with respect to whether any proposed  or  pending  legislation,  if  enacted,  or any  proposed  or  pending regulations or policy statements issued by any regulatory agency, whether or not promulgated  pursuant to any such legislation,  would affect the validity of the Offering or any aspect  thereof.  Such counsel may assume that any  agreement is the valid and binding obligation of any parties to such agreement other than the Company, the MHC or the Bank.\n\n         The  favorable  opinion,  dated as of the Closing Date and addressed to the  Agent and for their  benefit,  of the  Bank's  local  counsel,  in form and substance to the effect that, to the best of such counsel's  knowledge,  (i) the Company,  the MHC and the Bank have good and marketable  title to all properties and assets which are  material to the  business of the Company,  the MHC and the Bank and to those properties and assets described in the Registration  Statement and  Prospectus,  as owned  by them,  free  and  clear  of all  liens,  charges, encumbrances or  restrictions,  except such as are described in the Registration Statement and Prospectus, or are not material in relation to the business of the Company,  the MHC and the Bank  considered  as one  enterprise;  (ii) all of the leases and  subleases  material to the business of the Company,  the MHC and the Bank under which the Company, the MHC and the Bank hold properties, as described in the Registration Statement and Prospectus,  are in full force and effect; and (iii) the Bank is duly qualified as a foreign  corporation to transact  business and is in good standing in each  jurisdiction in which its ownership of property or  leasing  of  property  or  the  conduct  of  its  business   requires   such qualification,  unless  the  failure to be so  qualified  in one or more of such jurisdictions  would  not  have a  material  adverse  effect  on the  condition, financial or otherwise, or the business, operations or income of the Bank.\n\n          (d)  At the Closing Date,  the Agent shall have received the favorable                opinion,  dated as of the  Closing  Date,  of Silver,  Freedman &                Taff, L.L.P.,  the Agent's counsel,  with respect to such matters                as the Agent may reasonably  require.  Such opinion may rely upon                the opinions of counsel to the Company, the MHC and the Bank, and                as  to  matters  of  fact,  upon  certificates  of  officers  and                directors of the Company, the MHC and the Bank delivered pursuant                hereto or as such counsel shall reasonably request.\n\n          (e)  At the Closing Date, the Agent shall receive a certificate of the                Chief  Executive  Officer  and  the  Principal  Financial  and/or                Accounting  Officer of the Company,  the MHC and the Bank in form                and substance  reasonably  satisfactory  to the Agent's  Counsel,                dated as of such Closing Date, to the effect that:  (i) they have                carefully  reviewed the Prospectus and, in their opinion,  at the                time  the  Prospectus   became  authorized  for  final  use,  the                Prospectus  did not  contain any untrue  statement  of a material                fact or omit to state a material fact  necessary in order to make                the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which                they were made, not misleading;

 (iv) the  representations  and warranties in Section 4                are true and  correct  with the same  force and  effect as though                expressly  made at and as of the Closing  Date;

An  indemnifying  party  may  participate  at its own                expense in the  defense of such  action.  In  addition,  if it so                elects within a reasonable time after receipt of such notice,  an                indemnifying party,  jointly with any other indemnifying  parties                receiving  such  notice,  may assume  defense of such action with                counsel chosen by it and approved by the indemnified parties that                are defendants in such action,  unless such  indemnified  parties                reasonably object to such assumption on the ground that there may                be legal defenses available to them that are different from or in                addition to those  available to such  indemnifying  party.  If an                indemnifying  party  assumes  the  defense  of such  action,  the                indemnifying  parties  shall  not be  liable  for  any  fees  and                expenses  of  counsel  for  the  indemnified   parties   incurred                thereafter in connection  with such action,  proceeding or claim,                other than reasonable costs\n\n                                       35\n\n               of investigation.  In no event shall the indemnifying  parties be                liable for the fees and expenses of more than one  separate  firm                of attorneys (and any special  counsel that said firm may retain)                for each  indemnified  party in  connection  with any one action,                proceeding  or claim or separate but similar or related  actions,                proceedings or claims in the same jurisdiction arising out of the                same general allegations or circumstances.\n\n          (d)  The  agreements  contained  in this  Section  8 and in  Section 9                hereof and the representations and warranties of the Company, the                MHC  and the  Bank  set  forth  in this  Agreement  shall  remain                operative  and in full  force and effect  regardless  of: (i) any                investigation  made by or on behalf  of agent or their  officers,                directors or controlling persons,  agent or employees or by or on                behalf  of the  Company,  the MHC or the  Bank  or any  officers,                directors  or  controlling  persons,  agent or  employees  of the                Company,  the  MHC or the  Bank;  (ii)  delivery  of and  payment                hereunder  for the  Shares;  or  (iii)  any  termination  of this\n\n\n\n\n\n               Agreement.\n\n         Section 9.  Contribution.  In order to provide  for just and  equitable contribution  in  circumstances  in which the  indemnification  provided  for in Section 8 is due in  accordance  with its terms but is for any reason  held by a court to be unavailable  from the Company,  the MHC, the Bank or the Agent,  the Company,  the MHC,  the Bank and the Agent  shall  contribute  to the  aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including any investigation,  legal and other  expenses  incurred in connection  with, and any amount paid in settlement of, any action,  suit or proceeding of any claims asserted,  but after deducting any  contribution  received by the Company,  the MHC, the Bank or the Agent from persons  other  than  the  other  party  thereto,  who may  also be  liable  for contribution)  in such  proportion  so that the  Agent is  responsible  for that portion  represented by the percentage  that the fees paid to the Agent pursuant to  Section 2 of this  Agreement  (not  including  expenses)  bears to the gross proceeds  received by the Company  from the sale of the Shares in the  Offering, and the Company,  the MHC and the Bank shall be responsible for the balance. If, however,  the allocation provided above is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified  party failed to give the notice required under Section 8 above, then each indemnifying  party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified  party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative fault of the Company, the MHC and the Bank on the one hand and the Agent on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses,  claims,  damages or  liabilities  (or actions,  proceedings  or claims in respect  thereto),  but also the  relative  benefits  received  by the Company,  the MHC and the Bank on the one hand and the Agent on the  other  from the Offering (before deducting expenses). The relative fault shall be determined by  reference  to,  among other  things,  whether  the untrue or alleged  untrue statement  of a material  fact or the  omission  or alleged  omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, the MHC and/or the Bank on the one hand or the Agent on the other and the parties' relative intent, good faith,  knowledge,  access to  information  and  opportunity  to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company, the MHC, the Bank and the Agent agree that it would not be just and equitable if  contribution  pursuant to this Section 9 were determined by pro-rata allocation or by any other\n\n                                       36\n\nmethod  of   allocation   which  does  not  take  into  account  the   equitable considerations  referred to above in this  Section 9. The amount paid or payable by  an  indemnified  party  as a  result  of  the  losses,  claims,  damages  or liabilities (or actions,  proceedings or claims in respect thereof)  referred to above in this  Section 9 shall be deemed to include any legal or other  expenses reasonably  incurred by such indemnified party in connection with  investigating or defending any such action,  proceeding or claim. It is expressly  agreed that the Agent shall not be liable for any loss, liability,  claim, damage or expense or be required  to  contribute  any amount  which in the  aggregate  exceeds the amount paid (excluding reimbursable expenses) to the Agent under this Agreement. It is understood  that the above stated  limitation on the Agent's  liability is essential  to the  Agent and that the Agent  would  not have  entered  into this Agreement  if such  limitation  had not been  agreed to by the  parties  to this Agreement.  No person found guilty of any fraudulent  misrepresentation  (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to  contribution from any person who was not found guilty of such  fraudulent  misrepresentation. The  obligations  of the Company,  the MHC and the Bank under this Section 9 and under Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability  which the Company and the Bank may  otherwise  have.  For purposes of this Section 9, each of the Agent's, the Company's,  the MHC or the Bank's officers and directors and each person, if any,  who  controls  the Agent or the  Company or the MHC or the Bank within the meaning  of the  1933  Act and the  1934 Act  shall  have  the  same  rights  to contribution as the Agent, the Company,  the MHC or the Bank. Any party entitled to contribution, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action, suit,  claim or  proceeding  against  such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against another party under this Section 9, will notify such party from whom  contribution may be sought,  but the omission to so notify such party shall not relieve the party from whom contribution may be sought from any other  obligation it may have hereunder or otherwise than under this Section 9.\n\n         Section 10. Survival of Agreements,  Representations  and  Indemnities. The respective  indemnities of the Company,  the MHC, the Bank and the Agent and the representations and warranties and other statements of the Company, the MHC, the Bank and the Agent set forth in or made  pursuant  to this  Agreement  shall remain in full force and effect,  regardless of any  termination or cancellation of this Agreement or any  investigation  made by or on behalf of the Agent,  the Company,  the MHC, the Bank or any  controlling  person referred to in Section 8 hereof,  and shall  survive the  issuance of the Shares,  and any  successor  or assign of the Agent,  the Company,  the MHC, the Bank, and any such  controlling person  shall  be  entitled  to  the  benefit  of  the  respective   agreements, indemnities, warranties and representations.\n\n         Section 11.  Termination.  The Agent may  terminate  this  Agreement by giving  the  notice  indicated  below in this  Section 11 at any time after this Agreement becomes effective as follows:\n\n          (a)  In the  event  the  Company  fails to sell the  required  minimum                number of the Shares by _________,  2000, and in accordance  with                the provisions of the Plan or as required by the MHC Regulations,                and applicable law, this Agreement shall terminate upon refund by                the Company to each person who has  subscribed for or ordered any                of the Shares the full amount which it may\n\n\n\n\n\n                                       37\n\n               have  received  from  such  person,  together  with  interest  as                provided in the Prospectus,  and no party to this Agreement shall                have any obligation to the other hereunder, except for payment by                the  Company,  the MHC and/or  the Bank as set forth in  Sections                2(a), 6, 8 and 9 hereof.\n\n          (b)  If any of the  conditions  specified  in Section 7 shall not have                been  fulfilled  when and as  required by this  Agreement  unless                waived in writing, or by the Closing Date, this Agreement and all                of the Agent's  obligations  hereunder  may be  cancelled  by the                Agent  by  notifying  the  Company,  the MHC and the Bank of such                cancellation in writing or by telegram at any time at or prior to                the  Closing  Date,  and any such  cancellation  shall be without                liability  of any party to any other  party  except as  otherwise                provided in Sections 2(a), 6, 8 and 9 hereof.\n\n          (c)  If the Agent  elects to terminate  this  Agreement as provided in                this Section, the Company, the MHC and the Bank shall be notified                promptly by telephone or telegram, confirmed by letter.\n\n         The Company,  the MHC and the Bank may terminate  this Agreement in the event the Agent is in material breach of the  representations  and warranties or covenants  contained  in Section 5 and such  breach has not been cured after the Company,  the MHC and the Bank  have  provided  the  Agent  with  notice of such breach.\n\n         This Agreement may also be terminated by mutual written  consent of the parties hereto.\n\n         Section 12.

With respect to the Remarketing Agent's responsibilities, but without affecting the Calculation and Paying Agent's role as intermediary (if applicable), the Remarketing Agent hereby agrees that, if the Remarketing Agent obtains a bid at the Purchase Price for any VRRM-MFP Shares being remarketed, which, if accepted, would be binding on the bidder for the consummation of the sale of such VRRM-MFP Shares (an \"actionable bid\"), and the Remarketing Agent elects in its sole discretion to accept such actionable bid, the Remarketing Agent shall (i) purchase the Tendered VRRM-MFP Shares, as a principal and not as an agent, from the Beneficial Owner or Holder thereof on the Purchase Date at the Purchase Price, (ii) resell such VRRM-MFP Shares, as a principal and not as an agent, to the Person making such actionable bid at the Purchase Price, and (iii) record such purchase and resale on its books and records in accordance with this provision.

Except as otherwise expressly provided for herein, the purchase and delivery of Tendered VRRM-MFP Shares and the remarketing thereof, and payments with respect to the foregoing, will be accomplished in accordance with the applicable procedures of the Securities Depository.\n\n(h) Return of Unsold VRRM-MFP Shares. Any VRRM-MFP Shares unsold in a remarketing will be returned to the relevant tendering Beneficial Owners or their Agent Members, or the relevant tendering Holders, as the case may be, by the Remarketing Agent; provided that such tender will continue until the earlier of the occurrence of a successful remarketing or the Failed Remarketing Mandatory Redemption Date.\n\n(i) Timing Requirements. The Remarketing Agent agrees to the remarketing timing requirements applicable to it in the Supplement. The Remarketing Agent may, in its sole discretion, modify the settlement procedures set forth therein with respect to any Remarketing upon ten (10) days' prior written notice to the Fund and the Calculation and Paying Agent, provided any such modification does not adversely affect the Holders, the Beneficial Owners, the Calculation and Paying Agent or the Fund.\n\n(j) Purchases by Remarketing Agent. If the Remarketing Agent in its sole discretion decides to purchase unsold VRRM- MFP Shares for its own account, on each Purchase Date, the Remarketing Agent will settle such purchase through delivery against payment of the Purchase Price for such VRRM-MFP Shares to be received by the Remarketing Agent by 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on such Purchase Date.

Whenever the Fund intends or expects to include any Taxable Allocation in any dividend on VRRM-MFP Shares, the Fund shall provide a Notice of Taxable Allocation in accordance with Section 2.7(a) of the Supplement. Whenever such advance notice is received from the Fund, the Calculation and Paying Agent will notify each Holder and the Remarketing Agent. The Remarketing Agent shall promptly notify each potential Beneficial Owner or its Agent Member after receipt of such advance notice by the Remarketing Agent.\n\nSection 3. Representations, Warranties and Covenants of the Remarketing Agent and the Fund.\n\n(a) The Remarketing Agent hereby represents, warrants and agrees that it has, and during the term of this Agreement shall maintain, all licenses, consents and other rights required for the use of any index or other data in connection with calculation of the Dividend Rate or dissemination thereof.\n\n(b) The Fund represents and warrants to, and agrees with, the Remarketing Agent as as of each Purchase Date, Remarketing Date or New Mode Commencement Date, as applicable (each, a \"Representation Date\"), that (i) the Fund has made all the filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"Commission\") that are required to be made under the 1940 Act and the 1940 Act Regulations (collectively, the \"1940 Act Documents\"), (ii) each 1940 Act Document complies in all material respects with the requirements of the 1940 Act and the 1940 Act Regulations, and each 1940 Act Document did not at the time of filing with the Commission include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and (iii) the applicable Remarketing Materials, as amended or supplemented, including by any subsequently filed 1940 Act Document on or prior to such Representation Date (or, if applicable, by any document filed pursuant to the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act Regulations), as provided by the Fund, will not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided, however, that the Fund makes no representations or warranties with respect to information provided by the Remarketing Agent specifically for use in the Remarketing Materials.\n\n(c) The financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the 1940 Act Documents, together with the related notes and schedules, present fairly the financial position of the Fund as of the dates indicated and the results of operations, cash flows and changes in shareholders' equity of the Fund for the periods specified and have been prepared in compliance with the requirements of the 1940 Act and the 1940 Act Regulations and in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved; the other financial and statistical data contained or incorporated by reference in the 1940 Act Documents are accurately and fairly presented and prepared on a basis consistent with the financial statements and books and records of the Fund.\n\n(d) The Fund agrees (i) to deliver to the Remarketing Agent, within fifteen (15) calendar days following the last day of each calendar month beginning with [\u25cf], a report of 6\n\n\n\n\n\nportfolio holdings of the Fund as of the close of business as of the last Business Day of such calendar month, listing portfolio holdings of the Fund by CUSIP and principal amount, and (ii) that, on or after such fifteenth calendar day (or earlier, with the Fund's prior approval) the Remarketing Agent may provide such report and/or the information therein to investors in the VRRM- MFP Shares, upon the investor's request.\n\nSection 4. Fees and Expenses. For the performance of its services as Remarketing Agent hereunder, the Fund shall pay to the Remarketing Agent in arrears on the first day of each calendar month (or, if such day is not a Business Day, on the next succeeding Business Day) a monthly fee for each MFP Share Outstanding on the first calendar day of the preceding calendar month (or the date hereof in the case of the first such payment), in an amount, rounded upward to the nearest dollar, equal to (a) the product of (i) the rate of compensation as then in effect, as shall be agreed upon from time to time in writing by the Fund and the Remarketing Agent, times $[\u25cf] multiplied by (ii) the actual number of days from and including such first calendar day of the preceding calendar month (or the date hereof in the case of the first such payment) to and including the last calendar day of such preceding calendar month or, if applicable, the date of termination of this Agreement, if earlier, or the date of any prior redemption or liquidation for such share (as the case may be), divided by (b) 360. The obligation of the Fund to make the payments required by this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement and remain in full force and effect until all such payments shall have been made in full.\n\nSection 5. Resignation, Suspension and Removal of the Remarketing Agent.\n\n(a) The Remarketing Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder with respect to the VRRM-MFP Shares by giving 90 days' prior written notice to the Fund and the Calculation and Paying Agent.\n\n(b) The Fund may remove the Remarketing Agent with respect to the VRRM-MFP Shares by giving at least 60 days' prior written notice to the Remarketing Agent (and will provide prior notice also to the Calculation and Paying Agent, if any); provided, however, that no such removal shall become effective for an additional 30 days unless the Fund shall have appointed at least one nationally recognized securities dealer with expertise in remarketing variable rate securities as a successor Remarketing Agent for the VRRM-MFP Shares and the successor Remarketing Agent shall have entered into a remarketing agreement with the Fund, in form and substance satisfactory to the Fund, in which it shall have agreed to, among other duties, conduct remarketings in respect of VRRM-MFP Shares and determine the Dividend Rate on each Business Day for the VRRM-MFP Shares in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Supplement.\n\nIn each of the occurrences described in clause (a) or (b), the Fund shall use its best efforts to appoint a successor Remarketing Agent for such VRRM-MFP Shares and enter into a remarketing agreement with such Person as soon as reasonably practicable.\n\nSection 6. Dealing in the VRRM-MFP Shares. The Remarketing Agent in its sole discretion may purchase for its own account VRRM-MFP Shares in a remarketing; however, subject to the last two sentences in Section 2(c) above, the Remarketing Agent shall not be obligated to purchase any VRRM-MFP Shares that would otherwise remain unsold in a 7\n\n\n\n\n\nremarketing. None of the Fund, the Calculation and Paying Agent nor the Remarketing Agent (subject to the last sentence in Section 2(c) above) shall be obligated in any case to provide funds to make payment to a Beneficial Owner or its Agent Member or a Holder upon such Beneficial Owner's or Holder's tender of its VRRM-MFP Shares in a remarketing unless, in each case, such VRRM-MFP Shares were acquired for the account of the Fund, the Calculation and Paying Agent or the Remarketing Agent, as applicable. The Remarketing Agent may exercise any vote or join in any action which any Holder of VRRM-MFP Shares may be entitled to exercise or take pursuant to the Statement with like effect as if it did not act in any capacity hereunder. The Remarketing Agent, in its individual capacity, either as principal or agent, may also engage in or have an interest in any financial or other transaction with the Fund as freely as if it did not act in any capacity hereunder.\n\nSection 7. Information.\n\n(a) The Fund agrees to furnish to the Remarketing Agent: (i) copies of the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Statement, the Supplement and its bylaws and any amendment thereto and each report or other document mailed or made available to Holders (including annual reports to shareholders) or filed by the Fund with the Commission (including any documents incorporated therein by reference) as the Remarketing Agent may reasonably request from time to time; (ii) notice of the creation of any subsidiary by the Fund; (iii) notice of the purchase of VRRM-MFP Shares by a subsidiary or affiliate of the Fund as soon as the Fund shall become aware of such purchase; (iv) notice of any change (including being put on Credit Watch or Watchlist), suspension or termination in or of the ratings on the VRRM-MFP Shares by any NRSRO then rating the VRRM-MFP Shares or any change of an NRSRO rating the VRRM-MFP Shares as promptly as practicable upon the occurrence thereof or the occurrence of any of the events set forth in clause (b)(i) or (b)(ii) of Section 8 hereof (with the occurrence of any of the events described in clause (b)(ii) to be determined without regard to the opinion of the Remarketing Agent referred to therein); and (v) in connection with a remarketing, a Remarketing Memorandum, and such other remarketing information, as the Remarketing Agent may reasonably request from time to time, including but not limited to the financial condition of the Fund. The Fund agrees to provide the Remarketing Agent with as many copies of the foregoing materials and information as the Remarketing Agent may reasonably request for use in connection with a remarketing or Transition Remarketing, as the case may be, of VRRM-MFP Shares and consents to the use thereof for such purpose.\n\n(b) If at any time during the term of this Agreement any event or condition known to the Fund relating to or affecting the Fund or the VRRM-MFP Shares shall occur which might affect the accuracy or completeness of any statement of a material fact contained in any of the reports, documents, materials and information referred to in clause (a)(v) above or any document incorporated therein by reference (collectively, the \"Remarketing Materials\") or any other materials or information made publicly available by the Fund, the Fund shall promptly notify the Remarketing Agent in writing of the circumstances and details of such event or condition and the Fund shall promptly prepare or cause to be prepared and delivered to the Remarketing Agent, at the Fund's expense, a supplement or amendment to the Remarketing Materials describing the circumstances and details of such event or condition. 8\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 8. Conditions to Obligations of the Remarketing Agent. The obligations of the Remarketing Agent with respect to VRRM-MFP Shares under this Agreement have been undertaken in reliance on, and shall be subject to: (a) the due performance in all material respects by the Fund of its obligations and agreements as set forth in this Agreement (including Sections 3(c) and 7(b) hereof); and (b) the non-occurrence of any of the following events: (i) all of the VRRM-MFP Shares shall have been redeemed by the Fund; (ii) without the prior written consent of the Remarketing Agent, the Supplement, the Statement, the Declaration, the by-laws of the Fund, or the Tender and Paying Agent Agreement shall either not be in full force and effect or have been amended in any manner that in the reasonable opinion of the Remarketing Agent materially changes the nature of the VRRM- MFP Shares or the remarketing procedures; (iii) legislation, or a decision by a court of the United States shall be rendered, or a stop order, ruling, regulation or official statement by, or on behalf of, the Commission or other governmental agency having jurisdiction of the subject matter shall be made, to the effect that the offering or sale of the VRRM-MFP Shares is or would be in violation of any provision of the 1933 Act as then in effect, or the 1934 Act as then in effect, or with the purpose or effect of otherwise prohibiting the offering or sale of the VRRM-MFP Shares, as contemplated hereby, without registration under the 1933 Act; (iv) any legislation, resolution, ordinance, rule or regulation shall be enacted by, any governmental body, department or agency of the United States or the State of New York, or a decision by any court of competent jurisdiction within the United States or the State of New York shall be rendered, which, in the Remarketing Agent's reasonable opinion, materially adversely affects the marketability of the VRRM-MFP Shares; (v) additional material restrictions not in force as of the date hereof shall have been imposed upon trading in securities generally by any governmental authority or by any national securities exchange, which, in the Remarketing Agent's reasonable opinion, would cause the performance of the Remarketing Agent's obligations hereunder to violate applicable law; (vi) any litigation shall be instituted and be outstanding, to restrain or enjoin the sale or remarketing of the VRRM-MFP Shares or in any way protesting or affecting any authority of the Fund with respect to the validity of the VRRM- MFP Shares or this Agreement, or the existence or powers of the Fund to perform its obligations hereunder; (vii) a general banking moratorium has been declared by federal or New York authorities having jurisdiction, a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or clearance services or a force majeure event shall have occurred which in the reasonable opinion of the Remarketing Agent materially adversely affects the settlement or clearance of the VRRM-MFP Shares; or (viii) a material misstatement or omission in the Remarketing Materials has occurred, so that it is not advisable, in the reasonable judgment of the Remarketing Agent, to attempt to remarket the VRRM-MFP Shares, provided that the Remarketing Agent, upon identifying any such material misstatement or omission in the Remarketing Materials, shall promptly notify the Fund. In the event of the failure of any such conditions with respect to the VRMM-MFP Shares, the Remarketing Agent may terminate its obligations under this Agreement with respect to the VRMM-MFP Shares as provided in Section 10(b).\n\nSection 9. Indemnification.\n\n(a) The Fund and the Investment Adviser, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Remarketing Agent and its respective officers, directors, employees and control persons within the meaning of the 1934 Act (collectively, the \"Indemnified Persons\" 9\n\n\n\n\n\nand individually, an \"Indemnified Person\") from and against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which any Indemnified Person may become subject insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any of the Remarketing Materials or the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading (except with respect to information provided by the Remarketing Agent specifically for use therein), or arise out of, or are based upon, any violation by the Fund or the Investment Adviser of, or any failure by the Fund or the Investment Adviser to perform, any of its obligations under, this Agreement. The Fund and the Investment Adviser agree to promptly reimburse each Indemnified Person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Person in investigating, defending or preparing to defend any such action or claim; provided, however, that neither the Fund nor the Investment Adviser shall be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of the use by the Remarketing Agent of any information that is not contained in the Remarketing Materials (in the form provided for use in connection with the remarketing). The indemnity agreement in this paragraph shall be in addition to any liability or obligation which the Fund or the Investment Adviser may otherwise have to any Indemnified Person and shall extend upon the same terms and conditions to each Person, if any, who controls any Indemnified Person within the meaning of the 1934 Act.\n\n(b) The Fund agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnified Persons from and against every loss, liability or expense, including without limitation, damages, fines, suits, actions, demands, costs, out-of-pocket expenses, and reasonable legal fees and expenses (collectively, \"Losses\"), that may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against, any Indemnified Person for or in respect of its (1) execution and delivery of this Agreement, (2) compliance or attempted compliance with or reliance upon any instruction or other direction upon which the Remarketing Agent is authorized to rely pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and (3) performance under this Agreement, except to the extent that the Loss resulted from such Indemnified Person's gross negligence, willful misconduct, bad faith, violations of law or violations of the terms and conditions of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Fund agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnified Persons from and against any and all Losses that may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against, any Indemnified Person for or in respect of the failure of the Remarketing Agent to deliver Remarketing Materials during the course of a remarketing, if such failure is due to the failure by the Fund to provide to the Remarketing Agent such Remarketing Materials for delivery (regardless of whether the Remarketing Agent has requested such Remarketing Materials), notwithstanding that such failure by the Remarketing Agent to deliver Remarketing Materials during the course of a Remarketing could be deemed a violation of law by an Indemnified Person. The indemnity agreement in this paragraph shall be in addition to any liability or obligation which the Fund may otherwise have to any Indemnified Person.\n\n(c) Each Indemnified Person shall give notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each of the Fund and the Investment Adviser (collectively, the \"Indemnifying Persons\" and individually, an \"Indemnifying Person\") of any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify the Indemnifying Persons 10\n\n\n\n\n\nshall not relieve any Indemnifying Person from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. No settlement or compromise of any such action shall be made without the consent of the Indemnifying Persons, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.\n\n(d) In case any such action is brought against any Indemnified Person, and it notifies each Indemnifying Person from which it seeks indemnification of the commencement thereof, such Indemnifying Person (which may be the Fund and/or the Investment Adviser, in the case of notification of either) will be entitled to participate in, and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any other Indemnifying Person, similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof so long as its interests are not adverse to those of the Indemnified Person, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, and after notice from each Indemnifying Person to such Indemnified Person of its election to assume the defense thereof, the Indemnifying Person will not be liable to such Indemnified Person under this Section 9 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. Upon assumption by any Indemnifying Person of the defense of any such action or proceeding, the Indemnified Person shall have the right to participate in such action or proceeding and to retain its own counsel but the Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any legal expenses of other counsel subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with the defense thereof unless (i) the Indemnifying Person has agreed to pay such fees and expenses, (ii) the Indemnifying Person shall have failed to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person in a timely manner, or (iii) the Indemnified Person shall have been advised by counsel that there are actual or potential conflicting interests between the Indemnifying Persons and the Indemnified Person, including situations in which there are one or more legal defenses available to the Indemnified Person that are different from or additional to those available to each of the Fund and the Investment Adviser. If the Indemnifying Person elects not to assume the defense of any such suit, it will reimburse the Indemnified Persons for the reasonable fees and expenses of any counsel retained by them. In the event that the parties to any such action (including impleaded parties) include one or more Indemnifying Persons and one or more Indemnified Persons, and one or more Indemnified Persons shall have been advised by counsel reasonably satisfactory to each Indemnifying Person that there may be one or more legal defenses available to any of the Indemnified Persons, which are different from, additional to, or in conflict with those available to any of the Indemnifying Persons, the Indemnifying Persons will reimburse the Indemnified Persons for the reasonable fees and expenses of any counsel retained by the Indemnified Persons (it being understood that the Indemnifying Persons shall not, in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (plus local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, which firm shall be designated by the Indemnified Persons, the Remarketing Agent or each Indemnifying Person, as the case may be). Each Indemnifying Person agrees promptly to notify each Indemnified Person of the commencement of any litigation or proceedings against it in connection with the remarketing of the VRRM-MFP Shares. No Indemnifying Person shall consent to the terms of any compromise or settlement of any action defended by any Indemnifying Person in accordance with the foregoing without the prior consent of the Indemnified Person. No Indemnifying Person shall be liable under this Section 9 for the amount of any compromise or settlement of any action 11\n\n\n\n\n\nunless such compromise or settlement has been approved in writing by such Indemnifying Person, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.\n\n(e) If the indemnification provided for in subparagraph (a) of this Section 9 is unavailable, because of limitations imposed by securities laws or for any other reason, to a party that would otherwise have been an Indemnified Person under subparagraph (a) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then the party that would have been an Indemnifying Person thereunder shall, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion so that the Remarketing Agent is responsible for that portion represented by the percentage that the Remarketing Agent's fee (calculated for a one year period) with respect to such remarketing bears to the aggregate liquidation preference of such VRRM-MFP Shares being remarketed but will not exceed the amount of such fee (calculated for a one year period) and each of the Fund and the Investment Adviser is responsible for the balance; provided, however, that no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereon referred to above in this subparagraph (e)) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claims (which shall be limited as provided in this subparagraph (e) above if the Indemnifying Person has assumed the defense of any such action in accordance with the provisions thereof).\n\n(f) The indemnity agreements contained in clauses (a), (b) and (c) of this Section 9 shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Remarketing Agent, and shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement and the remarketing of any VRRM-MFP Shares hereunder.\n\nSection 10. Termination of Remarketing Agreement. (a) This Agreement shall terminate as to the Remarketing Agent and its obligations hereunder with respect to VRRM-MFP Shares upon the earliest to occur of (a) the effective date of the resignation or removal of such Remarketing Agent pursuant to Section 5(a) and Section 5(b), respectively, (b) the completion of a successful Transition Remarketing on a New Mode Commencement Date in connection with transition to a new Mode, or (c) the date on which no VRRM-MFP Shares are Outstanding.\n\n(b) In addition, the Remarketing Agent may terminate this Agreement and all of its obligations hereunder with respect to the VRRM-MFP Shares, by notifying the Fund and the Calculation and Paying Agent of its election to do so, if any of the conditions referred to or set forth in Section 8 hereof with respect to the VRRM-MFP Shares have not been met or satisfied in full and such failure shall have continued for a period of 30 days after the Remarketing Agent has given notice thereof to the Fund specifying the condition which has not been met and requiring it to be met; provided, however, that termination of this Agreement with respect to the VRRM-MFP Shares by the Remarketing Agent after giving the required notices with respect to the VRRM- MFP Shares shall be immediate in the event of the occurrence and continuation of 12\n\n\n\n\n\nany event set forth in Section 8(b)(i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) hereof with respect to the VRRM-MFP Shares, or in the event the Remarketing Agent determines, in its sole discretion, that it shall not have received all of the information, whether or not specifically referenced herein, necessary to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement with respect to the VRRM-MFP Shares.\n\nSection 11. Remarketing Agent's Performance; Duty of Care.\n\n(a) The duties and obligations of the Remarketing Agent shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this Agreement and the Supplement. No implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement, or the Supplement. In the absence of bad faith on the part of the Remarketing Agent, the Remarketing Agent may conclusively rely upon any document furnished to it, which purports to conform to the requirements of this Agreement and the Statement, as to the truth of the statements expressed in any of such documents. The Remarketing Agent shall be protected in acting upon any document or communication reasonably believed by it to have been signed, presented or made by the proper party or parties.

If CARDAX, Affiliates or their respective employees, servants or agents, or CAPSUGEL, its Affiliates or their respective employees, servants or agents (in each case an \"Indemnified Party\"), receive any written claim which such Indemnified Party believes is the subject of indemnity hereunder by the other Party hereto (an \"Indemnifying Party\"), the Indemnified Party shall, as soon as reasonably practicable after forming such belief, give notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party, provided that the failure to give timely notice to the Indemnifying Party as contemplated hereby shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any liability to the Indemnified Party unless the Indemnifying Party demonstrates that the defense of such claim is prejudiced by such failure. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, by prompt notice to the Indemnified Party to assume the defense of such claim at its cost, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party does not so assume the defense of such claim or, having done so, does not diligently pursue such defense, the Indemnified Party may assume the defense, with counsel of its choice, but at the cost of the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party so assumes the defense, it shall have absolute control of the litigation; the Indemnified Party may, nevertheless, participate therein through counsel of its choice and at its cost. The Party not assuming the defense of any such claim shall render all reasonable assistance to the Party assuming such defense, and out-of-pocket costs of such assistance shall be for the account of the Indemnifying Party. No such claim shall be settled other than by the Party defending the same, and then only with the consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided that the Indemnified Party shall have no obligation to consent to any settlement of any such claim which (i) imposes on the Indemnified Party any liability or obligation which cannot be assumed or performed in full by the Indemnifying Party, (ii) does not unconditionally release the Indemnified Party, (iii) does require a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates or (iv) does impose any restrictions on the conduct of business by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates.   8.4 Limitation of Damages.  IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OR LOST PROFITS ARISING UNDER OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT. Except in the event of (i) a Party's gross negligence or willful misconduct and/or (ii) a Party's breach of its confidentiality obligation, the total liability of one Party to the other Party (and its Affiliates) arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the Products, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), statute or otherwise, shall, to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law, be limited to the amount of revenues it receives under this Agreement.   8.5 Insurance. During the Term and for a period of two (2) years after the termination of the Agreement or the expiry date of the last batch manufactured whichever is later, thereafter, each Party shall obtain and maintain, at its sole expense adequate product liability insurance for the Product as it reasonably deems necessary and appropriate. Evidence of coverage, in the form of certificates of insurance, shall be provided promptly upon registration of the Product in given countries and as reasonably requested thereafter.

A material breach that is subject to cure that is not cured within [***] of written notice of breach shall be cause for termination, provided that if the breaching party is diligently pursuing in good faith the remedy of the breach at the expiration of such [***] cure period, then such [***] cure period shall be extended for a reasonable period to effect the cure. Upon any breach by CAPSUGEL, CARDAX shall be permitted to use all Intellectual Property of CAPSUGEL used in the Formulation and the Product to the extent necessary for the development and marketing of the Product. Upon any breach by CARDAX, CAPSUGEL shall be permitted to use all Intellectual Property of CARDAX used in the Active Ingredient and the Product to the extent necessary for the development and marketing of the Product in accordance with the terms of this Agreement as of the date of such termination.   10.3 Termination for Bankruptcy .

Neither Party shall be liable to the other for default or delay in the performance of any of its obligations under this Agreement if such default or delay shall be caused directly or indirectly by accident, fire, flood, riot, war, terrorism, act of God, embargo, strike, failure or delay of normal source of supply of materials, or delay of carriers, equipment failure or complete or partial shutdown of plant by any of the foregoing causes or other causes beyond its reasonable control, including FDA action (\"Force Majeure\").   10.6 No Waiver. The failure of either Party to terminate this Agreement by reason of the breach of any of its provisions by the other Party shall not be construed as a waiver of the rights or remedies available for any subsequent breach of the terms and provisions of this Agreement.   10.7 Property. In the event of termination of this Agreement for whatever cause, in addition to the other obligations of the Parties hereunder, each Party shall return to the other Party or to the other Party's designee no later than thirty (30) days after the effective date of termination all of such other Party's property, including all proprietary information, in its possession, except to the extent required to be retained by law or to comply with such Party's continuing obligations hereunder.   10.8 Survival.

      "question": "Is a party restricted from contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty, whether during the contract or after the contract ends (or both)?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, the franchise agreement contains restrictions on the franchisee's ability to compete with Pretzel Time, both during the term of the franchise agreement and after its termination or expiration.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n1. During the term of the franchise agreement, the franchisee agrees that neither it, its affiliates, nor its owners will have any direct or indirect interest in a \"Competitive Business\" located at the franchise site, within 3 miles of the franchise unit, or within 3 miles of any other Pretzel Time unit in operation or under development (Section 21.A).\n\n2. After termination or expiration of the franchise agreement, the franchisee and its owners agree not to have any direct or indirect interest in a Competitive Business located at the franchise site, within 3 miles of the franchise unit, or within 3 miles of any other Pretzel Time unit in operation or under development for a period of 12 months (Section 20.G).\n\nThe agreement also restricts the franchisee from recruiting or hiring any employees who were employed by Pretzel Time or another Pretzel Time franchisee within the prior 6 months, without Pretzel Time's prior written permission (Section 21.A(2)).\n\nSo in summary, the franchise agreement imposes non-compete and non-solicitation restrictions on the franchisee both during the contract term and for a period after the contract ends.",
      "generated_response": "Based on the provided context, there is no specific section that directly addresses restrictions on contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty. However, Section 6 (TRADEMARKS AND LIMITATIONS) mentions the use of service marks and trademarks, which may imply some restrictions on using the counterparty's intellectual property.\n\nSection 6.E (TRADEMARK ENFORCEMENT) states that the franchisor has the right to enforce its trademarks, but it does not explicitly restrict the franchisee from contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the franchisor.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided context, it appears that there is no explicit restriction on contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty. However, it is always best to consult the full contract or seek legal advice to confirm the specific terms and conditions of the agreement.",

Franchisee shall have no exclusive Territory based on this Agreement.\n\n         2.D.     RESERVATION OF RIGHTS.\n\n         Except as expressly limited by Section 2.C., Pretzel Time (on behalf of itself,  its Affiliates and its designees)  retains all rights,  in its sole and exclusive discretion,  to offer to sell the Products and services authorized for Pretzel Time Units under the Marks  hereinafter  described in Section 6 or other trade names, trademarks, service marks and commercial symbols through similar or dissimilar  channels of distribution and national  accounts and pursuant to such terms and  conditions  as Pretzel Time deems  appropriate.

FRANCHISEE  ACKNOWLEDGES  THAT  ABSENT A SEPARATE  AREA  DEVELOPER'S  AGREEMENT, PRETZEL  TIME  HAS THE  RIGHT  TO  PLACE  UNITS  AT ANY  LOCATION,  AT ITS  SOLE DISCRETION, AND WITHOUT REGARD TO THE IMPACT UPON THE FRANCHISEE'S BUSINESS.\n\n         Franchisee  acknowledges that because complete and detailed  uniformity under many varying  conditions  may not be possible or  practical,  Pretzel Time specifically reserves the right and privilege,  at its sole discretion and as it may deem in the best  interests of all  concerned in any specific  instance,  to\n\n\n\n\n\nvary standards for any Franchisee based upon the peculiarities of the particular Site,  landlords'  requirements,  business potential,  or other conditions which Pretzel  Time deems to be of  importance  to the  successful  operation  of such Franchisee's business.\n\n         2.E.     OPTION TO DEVELOP OTHER SITES WITHIN THE TERRITORY.\n\n         If Franchisee  seeks to add a different type of Pretzel Time Unit, such as a kiosk or a cart,  within the Territory,  then  Franchisee must seek Pretzel Time's  approval by  notifying  Pretzel  Time,  in  writing,  that he desires to develop  and  operate  other  units,  including  a cart  or  kiosk,  within  the Territory.  If Pretzel  Time has fully  negotiated  a lease  agreement  for such location,  then  Franchisee  shall (1) obtain the  consent  of the  landlord  to execute such lease and execute such lease,  if applicable;  (2) execute  Pretzel Time's then current form of Satellite Unit Addendum  (containing  Pretzel Time's then  current  fees  and  expense  requirements)  and such  ancillary  documents (including guarantees) as are then customarily used by Pretzel Time in the grant of franchises for Pretzel Time Units as modified for use in connection  with the Site, as necessary, and (3) pay Pretzel Time's reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in locating such additional  Site and negotiating the lease  agreement, all within ten (10) business days after Pretzel Time's delivery to Franchisee of the lease agreement and the franchise documents.\n\n         If Franchisee  timely notifies  Pretzel Time in writing that Franchisee desires to develop and operate an additional  Pretzel Time Unit, such as a kiosk or cart,  within its Territory and Pretzel Time has not fully negotiated a lease agreement for such location, then Franchisee will have thirty (30) days in which to negotiate and deliver to Pretzel Time a lease agreement for such site in form for execution.  If Pretzel Time  disapproves  the lease agreement for failure to meet  Pretzel  Time's  requirements,  Franchisee  will have ten (10) days within which to negotiate  and deliver to Pretzel Time a revised  lease  agreement  for such  location  in form for  execution.  If  Pretzel  Time  approves  the  lease agreement  for such  location  as  meeting  Pretzel  Time's  requirements,  then Franchisee  will (1) execute  such lease  agreement;  (2) execute the  franchise documents;   and  (3)  pay  Pretzel  Time's  reasonable  out-of-pocket  expenses incurred,  if any, in locating such  additional  Site and  negotiating the lease agreement,  all within ten (10) business days after Pretzel  Time's  delivery to Franchisee of the lease agreement and the franchise documents.\n\n         2.F.     TERM OF FRANCHISE.\n\n         The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date of this Agreement  and shall expire  twenty (20) years from the  effective  date of this Agreement.  References in this  Agreement to the term of this Agreement mean the initial term and any renewal term.\n\n3.       OTHER DISTRIBUTION METHODS.\n\n         3.A.     SPECIAL DISTRIBUTION ARRANGEMENTS.\n\n         Franchisee  acknowledges  and agrees that (1) Franchisee is not granted any rights to operate Special  Distribution  Arrangements  within or outside the Territory  pursuant to this agreement;  and (2) the right to operate or grant to others the right to operate  Special  Distribution  Arrangements  is reserved to Pretzel Time;  and (3) Pretzel Time has no obligation to offer to Franchisee the right to operate Special Distribution Arrangements;  and (4) Pretzel Time or its designees  may instead  operate or grant to others the right to operate  Special Distribution Arrangements within and/or outside the Territory.\n\n4.       FRANCHISE AND OTHER FEES.\n\n         4.A.     INITIAL FRANCHISE FEE.\n\n         The initial franchise fee is Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00).

The franchise fee is fully  earned  by  Pretzel  Time  upon the  payment  in full  thereof  and is nonrefundable   (except  as   specifically   provided  in  this   agreement)  as consideration for expenses incurred by Pretzel Time in furnishing assistance and services to Franchisee  and for Pretzel  Time's lost or deferred  opportunity to franchise others,  and not as compensation for the use of the copyrighted works, Marks or Trade Dress. Franchisee acknowledges and agrees that this franchise fee is reasonable. The fee is not reduced if Pretzel Time is unable to obtain a TCBY Franchise.  An  additional  $1,000 is payable by Franchisee to Pretzel Time as a Yogurt Fee if Yogurt Product is included in the Franchise.\n\n         4.B.     DEFERRAL OF FRANCHISE FEE.\n\n         Payment of the initial  franchise fee is deferred for  franchises to be located in Minnesota and for Minnesota  residents until the franchise Unit opens at which time the franchise fee must be paid in full to Pretzel Time.  Franchise fees for Maryland  residents  and  franchises  to be located in Maryland will be escrowed  until the unit is  opened.  There may be other  stores in which  state administrators have required fees or royalties to be deferred or escrowed.\n\n         4.C.     ROYALTY FEE.\n\n\n\n\n\n         Franchisee,  in  partial  consideration  of the  grant of a  franchise, agrees to pay to Pretzel  Time a  continuing  Royalty of seven  percent  (7%) of Franchisee's  net  revenues  (as  defined  in  Section  1) on a weekly  basis as specified in this  Section;  provided  only 4% Royalty  shall be payable on TCBY frozen yogurt and other TCBY frozen yogurt products.  The Royalty is not uniform as to  all  franchisees,  it is  fully  earned,  and  is  nonrefundable  in  any circumstance.  Franchisee  shall pay weekly by electronic  funds  transfer (ACH) without offset,  defalcation,  credit or deduction of any nature to Pretzel Time the royalty fee, the advertising  fund fee and all other amounts due and payable on each Wednesday for the immediately  preceding week. The Royalty shall be paid by electronic funds transfer from Franchisee's  general operating  account.  The Royalty is paid,  in part,  to  compensate  Pretzel  Time for  various  services provided  to  Franchisee  after the Unit opens,  including,  but not limited to, quality, service, and cleanliness inspections. Pretzel Time, upon written notice to  Franchisee,  shall  have the right to  change  the  timing  of  Franchisee's payments of Royalty  Fees and  Advertising  Fund Fees due under this  Agreement. Franchisee  shall not subordinate to any other  obligation his obligation to pay the Royalty Fee or any other fee or charge hereunder.\n\n         4.D.     ADVERTISING FUND FEE.\n\n         Franchisee  agrees to pay on a weekly basis to Pretzel Time, as partial consideration  for the grant of the Franchise,  an  Advertising  Fund Fee of one percent  (1%) of Net revenues  for the  preceding  week as defined in Section 1. Franchisee  herein  acknowledges that the Advertising Fund Fee is not uniform as to all franchisees.  The Advertising Fund Fee is fully earned and nonrefundable. The  Advertising  Fund Fee shall be paid by electronic  funds  transfer from the Franchisee's  general  operating  account on Wednesday of each week based on the preceding week's Net revenues.\n\n         4.E.     TRANSFER FEE.\n\n         If Franchisee desires to assign his rights under the Franchise to a new franchisee,  Franchisee  (Assignor of the  Franchise),  agrees to pay to Pretzel Time a transfer  fee equal to the  greater of SIX  THOUSAND  TWO  HUNDRED  FIFTY DOLLARS  ($6,250.00) or the then current  transfer fee being paid by franchisees upon the assignment, gift, bequeath or transfer of ownership of the Franchise to cover administrative costs and expenses. The transfer fee is non-refundable. The fee shall be due and payable by the current  Franchisee to Pretzel Time five (5) days prior to the transfer of the Franchise to the assignee.  Additionally,  the assignee  of the  Franchisee  shall pay  Pretzel  Time an  additional  amount of Twenty-Five  Thousand Dollars  ($25,000.00) (plus $1,000.00 if Yogurt Product is included),  for any  additional  units that are not existing  stores or the then current initial franchisee fee for traditional Pretzel Time Units.\n\n         4.F.     FEES FOR ADDITIONAL FRANCHISES.\n\n          In the event that Franchisee  meets Pretzel Time's  qualifications  to open  additional  Franchises at sites  acceptable to both Franchisee and Pretzel Time,  which  approval is at the sole  discretion of Pretzel  Time,  the initial franchisee  fee shall be the greater of FIVE THOUSAND  DOLLARS  ($5,000.00)(plus $1,000.00 if Yogurt  Product is included) or the then current fee for additional franchises set by Pretzel Time, at its sole discretion. The decision to grant an additional  franchise  location shall be in the sole  discretion of Pretzel Time and at no time does Pretzel Time promise or guarantee that additional franchises will be offered  or  approved.  Such  decisions  will be made on a  case-to-case basis,  based on  factors  including,  but not  limited to the  availability  of suitable locations,  quality of standards maintained in the Franchisee's current Units,   the  impact  of  additional   locations  upon  the  operations  of  the Franchisee's  current Units, the geographical  distance between the Franchisee's existing and proposed  location,  the business  plan of Pretzel  Time,  national contracts  with  major  corporations,  the  population  of  the  area  near  the prospective  site,  the quality of the site,  and other  economic  and  business factors.  Under no  circumstances  is  Franchisee  entitled to demand or require Pretzel Time to grant to Franchisee a Franchise or a similar variation thereof.\n\n         4.G.     FEES FOR RENEWAL OF FRANCHISE.\n\n         Franchisee  agrees that in consideration of the grant of the \"Successor Franchise\"  (defined in Section 5.A.),  Franchisee shall pay the current renewal fee as of the  date of  renewal  and  execute  a  general  release  in the  form prescribed  by Pretzel Time in  accordance  with Section 5.B. The renewal fee is due and payable thirty (30) days prior to the renewal day.\n\n         4.H.     PAYMENT BY ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER.\n\n         Franchisee agrees to pay all Royalties,  Advertising Fund Fees, amounts due Pretzel Time for purchases by Franchisee from Pretzel Time or its Affiliates and other amounts which  Franchisee  owes to Pretzel Time via  electronic  funds transfer from Franchisee's general account,  which shall be initiated by Pretzel Time and any transfer fees shall be paid by Franchisee  every  Wednesday for the preceding week based upon the Net Revenues.  Franchisee herein agrees to execute and complete all necessary  documentation required by Pretzel Time to permit the wire transfer to Pretzel Time (in the form attached  hereto as Exhibit E or such other form as Pretzel Time shall accept). Under this procedure, Franchisee shall authorize  Pretzel  Time to initiate  debit  entries  and/or  credit  correction entries  to  Franchisee's   general  operating  bank  account  for  payments  of Royalties,  Advertising Fund Fees and other amounts payable under this Agreement and any late or interest  charges due thereon.  Franchisee  shall make the funds\n\n\n\n\n\navailable to Pretzel Time for  withdrawal by  electronic  transfer no later than one day prior to the due date for payment therefor.  The Royalty and Advertising Fund Fees amount actually  transferred from Franchisee's  account shall be based on the Unit's Net Revenues  indicated on the reports  submitted by Franchisee as required  hereunder.  If Franchisee  has not reported the Unit's Net Revenues to Pretzel  Time  for any week as  required  herein,  then  Pretzel  Time  shall be authorized  to  debit  Franchisee's  account  in an  amount  equal  to the  fees transferred from Franchisee's  account for the last reporting period for which a report of the Unit's Net  Revenues  was  provided  to Pretzel  Time as  required hereunder.  If,  at any  time,  Pretzel  Time  determines  that  Franchisee  has under-reported the Unit's Net Revenues, or underpaid Royalty or Advertising Fund Fees or other  amounts  due  hereunder,  Pretzel  Time  shall be  authorized  to initiate  immediately a debit to Franchisee's  account in the appropriate amount in  accordance  with the foregoing  procedure,  plus interest as provided for in this  Agreement.  Any  overpayment  shall be  credited to  Franchisee's  account through a credit  effective  as of the first week after  Franchisee  and Pretzel Time  determine  that such credit is due.  Notwithstanding  any  designation  by Franchisee, Pretzel Time shall have the sole discretion to apply any payments by Franchisee to any past  indebtedness  of Franchisee  for Royalty or  Advertising Fund Fees,  purchases from Pretzel Time and/or its  Affiliates,  interest or any other indebtedness,  including,  without  limitation,  payment of rental sums in arrears for the Unit.\n\n         4.I.     LATE CHARGE AND INTEREST.\n\n         To compensate Pretzel Time for the increased  administrative expense of handling late payments,  Pretzel Time may charge Franchisee a $50.00 late charge for each delinquent payment.  All Royalty and Advertising Fund Fees, amounts due for  purchases by  Franchisee  from Pretzel  Time or its  Affiliates,  and other amounts  which  Franchisee  owes to Pretzel  Time or its  Affiliates  shall bear interest  after  their due date at a rate equal to the  lesser of: (1)  eighteen percent (18%) per annum for the number of days which such payment is due; or (2) the highest  applicable  legal rate  permitted  by  applicable  law.  Franchisee acknowledges  that this  Section  shall  not  constitute  Pretzel  Time's or its Affiliates' agreement to accept such payments after they are due or a commitment by Pretzel  Time or its  Affiliates  to extend  credit to or  otherwise  finance operation of the Unit.  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of this Section  4.I., Franchisee  acknowledges and agrees that his failure to pay all amounts when due shall constitute grounds for termination of this Agreement.\n\n5.       RENEWAL OF FRANCHISE TERM.\n\n         5.A.     FRANCHISEE'S RIGHT TO A SUCCESSOR FRANCHISE.\n\n         Upon the expiration of the initial term of this  Agreement,  Franchisee shall  have the one time  right to obtain a  successor  franchise  to  operate a Pretzel  Time Unit at the Site (a  \"Successor  Franchise\")  for a single term of five (5) years  immediately  following the expiration of the initial term of the Franchise upon giving Pretzel Time six (6) months notice prior to the expiration of the then current term if:\n\n         (1) Franchisee and its Owners have complied with this Agreement and any          amendment  during the initial  term of this  Agreement  in all material          respects; and\n\n         (2) Franchisee  maintains  possession of the Site and agrees to remodel          and/or expand the Unit, add or replace equipment, furnishings, fixtures          and signs and  otherwise  modify  the Unit to bring it into  compliance          with   specifications  and  standards  then  applicable  under  new  or          Successor Franchises for Pretzel Time Units; or if Franchisee is unable          to maintain  possession  of the Site, or if, in the judgment of Pretzel          Time,  the Unit should be  relocated,  Franchisee  secures a substitute          site approved by Pretzel Time and agrees to develop  expeditiously such          substitute  site in compliance with  specifications  and standards then          applicable  under new or successor  franchises  for Pretzel Time units;          and\n\n         (3) Pretzel  Time has not given notice of its election not to renew six          (6) months  prior to the  expiration  of the  initial  twenty (20) year          term; and\n\n         (4)  Franchisee  is not in default of any material term or condition of          the lease  agreement,  or any other agreement  between Pretzel Time and          Franchisee; and\n\n         (5) Franchisee executes Pretzel Time's then current Franchise Agreement          and  other  ancillary  agreements  required  and being  offered  to new          Franchisees on the date of renewal, which agreements shall supersede in          all respects this  Agreement and the terms of which may differ from the          terms of this Agreement,  including,  without limitation,  Royalty Fees          and  Advertising  Fund  Fees,  other  fees  and  charges,   performance          criteria,  and a provision which allows Pretzel Time and its Affiliates          to reserve  the right,  both within and  outside of the  Territory,  to          offer and sell at wholesale or retail, through channels of distribution          distinct  from  those  of a  Franchise,  Products  and  services  which          comprise,  or may in the  future  comprise a part of the  Pretzel  Time          System, which Products may be resold at retail to the general public by          such entities; and\n\n         (6) Franchisee is in full  compliance  with Pretzel  Time's  Operations Manual; and\n\n         (7) On renewal,  Franchisee  agrees to pay the current renewal fee, the          Royalty and  Advertising  Fund fees specified in Pretzel Time's current\n\n\n\n\n\n         Franchise  Agreement then being offered new  Franchisees on the date of          renewal; and\n\n         (8) Franchisee shall execute general releases,  in form satisfactory to          Pretzel  Time,  of any and all  claims  against  Pretzel  Time  and its          Affiliates and their officers, directors, employees, agents, successors          and assigns arising under this Agreement; and\n\n         (10)   Franchisee   has  complied  with  Pretzel  Time's  then  current          qualification and training requirements.\n\n         Following receipt of Franchisee's election to renew, Pretzel Time shall provide Franchisee with an execution copy of the form of Franchise  Agreement to be entered into for the renewal  term.  If the  Franchisee  does not execute and return the renewal Franchise Agreement within thirty (30) days of receipt,  then Franchisee  shall be deemed to have  withdrawn  its notice of renewal,  and this Agreement shall terminate at the end of the current term.\n\n         Pretzel Time may, at its option, with reasonable cause and upon written notice,  elect not to renew the Franchise  Agreement.  Pretzel Time shall notify Franchisee  of the  nonrenewal  not  less  than  six  (6)  months  prior  to the expiration  of the term of this  Agreement.  If  applicable  law  requires  that Pretzel Time give longer  notice to  Franchisee  prior to the  expiration of the term than is specified in the Franchise Agreement,  the Franchise Agreement will remain in effect on a  month-to-month  basis until the requisite notice has been given.\n\n         5.B.     RELEASES.\n\n         Franchisee  and its Owners  shall  execute  general  releases,  in form satisfactory  to Pretzel Time (the  general form of which is attached  hereto as Exhibit \"K\"), of any and all claims against  Pretzel Time and its Affiliates and their  respective  shareholders,   officers,   directors,   employees,   agents, successors and assigns.

Without  limiting the generality of the  foregoing,  Pretzel Time shall not have liability  with  respect  to any of the  following,  all of  which  are the sole responsibility of Franchisee:\n\n          (1). if   construction   of  the  Unit  does  not  fully  satisfy  the                requirements  (if  any)  of  the  landlord,  the  architect,  the                contractor,  and any governmental  agency having  jurisdiction or                does not fully satisfy the criteria  established  by Pretzel Time                for construction and development of Pretzel Time Units;\n\n          (2). if the Unit improvements are not structurally  sound or free from                defects or deficiencies;\n\n          (3). if there are any construction delays or cost overruns; or\n\n          (4). if  there  are  any  disputes  with  any  landlord,   contractor,                subcontractor,  architect,  supplier or governmental  agency with                respect to any aspect of the design, construction,  provision, or                equipping of the Unit.\n\n9.       UNIT OPENING.\n\n         9.A.     COMMENCEMENT OF OPERATIONS.\n\n         Franchisee shall commence operation of the Franchise the earlier of: 1) one  hundred  fifty (150) days after the  execution  of this  Agreement;  (2) as specified in the lease for the Site; or (3) as otherwise required or approved in writing by Pretzel Time. Failure to open the Unit within the aforementioned time period shall  result in the  termination  of this  Franchise  Agreement  and all franchise fees paid by Franchisee shall be nonrefundable.  Franchisee agrees not to open the Unit for business until the following has occurred:\n\n          (1). Pretzel  Time  approves  the  Unit  pursuant  to its  Pre-Opening                Checklist;\n\n          (2). Pre-opening  training of Franchisee  and Unit  personnel has been                completed to Pretzel Time's satisfaction;\n\n          (3). The  initial  franchise  fee and all  other  amounts  then due to                Pretzel Time have been paid in full;\n\n         (4).  Pretzel  Time has been  furnished  with  copies of all  insurance          policies  required  by  this  Agreement,  or  such  other  evidence  of          insurance  coverage and payment of premiums as Pretzel  Time  requests;          and\n\n     (5) Franchisee has executed Pretzel Time's wire transfer agreement.\n\n         Franchisee  agrees  to open the  Unit for  business  on or  before  the opening date specified in the lease if it has the  Landlord's  approval and only after Pretzel Time notifies Franchisee that the conditions set forth in Sections 8 and 9 have been satisfied.\n\n10.      FRANCHISEE TRAINING.\n\n         10.A.    INITIAL TRAINING.\n\n         Franchisee  acknowledges and agrees that, while Pretzel Time's training program will provide  Franchisee  with the  fundamental  knowledge  necessary to operate a unit,  Franchisee  cannot  expect  success  unless he devotes his best personal efforts to the business and exercises good business judgment in dealing with customers,  suppliers, and employees.  Prior to the Unit's opening, Pretzel Time shall  furnish an initial  training  program on the  operation of a Pretzel Time Unit which shall take place at Pretzel Time's  headquarters  in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania,  or at a location  which will  provide the best  training  for the\n\n\n\n\n\nFranchisee,  which may or may not be close to Pretzel Time's  headquarters.  The Franchisee agrees that he and his Unit Manager shall attend the initial training session held four (4) to eight (8) weeks prior to the Unit's  projected  opening date. Pretzel Time will not charge for the initial training of the Franchisee or if a corporation or partnership,  the Principal Owners of the Franchisee and the Unit  Manager.  All  incidental  expenses  relative  to the  required  training, including  travel  expenses,  hotel/motel  expenses,  and  meals  shall  be  the responsibility  of  the  Franchisee  while  attending  training.  Prior  to  the commencement  of the  operation  of the Unit,  the  manager  of the Unit  (\"Unit Manager\") and the  Franchisee or if a corporation or  partnership,  one Owner of the Franchisee as identified in Exhibit B, who will be personally overseeing the Unit shall attend and  successfully  complete the Pretzel Time initial  training program to the satisfaction of Pretzel Time.\n\n         The  Franchisee  and his  Unit  Manager  must  satisfactorily  complete Pretzel  Time's  training as  determined  by Pretzel  Time, in its sole opinion, before  Franchisee is allowed to operate the Franchise.  If Pretzel Time, in its sole discretion, determines that Franchisee is unable to satisfactorily complete the  training  program,  Pretzel  Time  shall have the right to  terminate  this Agreement and no franchise fees shall be refunded.  The initial training program shall cover material aspects of the operation of a Pretzel Time Unit,  including financial   controls,   employee  relations,   food  preparation,   service  and operational techniques,  sampling, recipes and cooking procedures, marketing and public  relations,  cleanliness and maintenance  procedures,  and maintenance of Pretzel  Time  System  standards.  Franchisee  shall  receive  one  copy  of the Operations Manual, which cannot be reproduced, in whole or in part. In the event that  the  Franchisee's  copy  is  lost  destroyed  or  significantly   damaged, Franchisee  shall be  obligated  to obtain from Pretzel  Time,  at  Franchisee's expense a replacement copy of the Operations Manual.\n\n         10.B.    EMPLOYEE TRAINING.\n\n         Pretzel  Time may  provide  to  Franchisee,  at  Franchisee's  request, guidance in the selection of a Unit Manager and may provide periodic evaluations of  Franchisee's  Unit,  Managers  and  employees,  but  without  any  liability therefore to Pretzel Time. Franchisee shall hire all employees of the franchise, be exclusively  responsible for the terms of their employment and  compensation, and  implement a training  program for  employees of the  franchise.  Franchisee agrees  to  maintain  a staff  of  trained  employees  to  operate  the  Unit in compliance with Pretzel Time's standards.\n\n         In the event the Unit Manager ceases to hold such full-time position at the  Unit,  Franchisee  shall  have  thirty  (30)  days in  which to  appoint  a substitute  or  replacement  Unit  Manager,  who must  attend  and  successfully complete,  to  Pretzel  Time's  satisfaction  the  initial  training  program as specified  above within sixty (60) days after  employment  as Unit  Manager.  If Pretzel  Time in its sole  discretion  determines  that the Unit  Manager or any subsequently  appointed Unit Manager has failed to  satisfactorily  complete the initial  training  program or any  additional  or  refresher  training  program, Franchisee  agrees to  immediately  hire a substitute  Unit Manager and promptly arrange  for such  person  to  complete  the  initial  training  program  to the satisfaction  of Pretzel Time.  Franchisee  agrees to notify Pretzel Time of any new  Unit  Managers  for the  Unit  within  seven  (7)  business  days of  their employment.  In the event  Franchisee  operates more than one (1) Unit, at least one (1)  trained and  competent  Unit  Manager  referred to above shall act as a full-time manager in each Territory. Franchisee shall keep Pretzel Time informed at all times of the identity of any Unit Manager(s) of the Unit.\n\n         All Unit  Managers  of the Unit must  have  successfully  completed  an initial training program as specified by Pretzel Time at the sole expense of the Franchisee, including, but not limited to, salary and incidental travel expenses attendant to any training provided by Pretzel Time. Franchisee and Unit Managers who  successfully  complete  training will receive a Training  Certificate  from Pretzel Time.  Pretzel Time shall make training  available to Franchisee's  Unit Manager during Pretzel Time's regularly  scheduled training course. In no event, will  Pretzel Time be under any  obligation  to provide  individual  training to Franchisee's  Unit  Managers.  Franchisee  agrees that each Unit  Manager  shall participate at Franchisee's  expense in Pretzel Time's initial  training program and all other mandatory  training  programs which may subsequently be offered by Pretzel Time.\n\n         10.C.  ON-SITE TRAINING.\n\n         Additionally,   Pretzel   Time  will   provide   on-site   training  at Franchisee's  business  location for a period of five (5) days,  generally to be commenced  immediately  prior to  Franchisee's  day of opening and continued the first three (3) days of operation.  Franchisee  herein agrees to notify  Pretzel Time,  in writing,  of his opening  date  twenty (20) days prior  thereto.  This training  will include all  functions  required for the proper  operation of the franchise.\n\n         Should Franchisee  request  additional  assistance from Pretzel Time in order to facilitate  the opening of the  Franchise,  and should Pretzel Time, in its discretion,  deem it necessary,  feasible and appropriate to comply with the request or should Pretzel Time determine that  additional  training is required, Franchisee  shall  reimburse  Pretzel Time at Pretzel  Time's then current daily training  service fee, for the expense of Pretzel Time providing such additional assistance and for its training  related  expenses,  which may include,  travel, room and board.\n\n         10.D.    COMPANY GROWTH.\n\n         Throughout  the  term of  this  Agreement,  Pretzel  Time  may  provide Franchisee  with  information  on company  growth and  operations as well as new\n\n\n\n\n\ntechniques developed to reduce costs and/or enhance sales or profits.\n\n         10.E.    RETRAINING PROGRAMS.\n\n         Pretzel  Time shall  provide  re-training  programs  at a  location  of Pretzel Time's choice from time to time for  experienced  franchisees  and their managers and/or employees.  Pretzel Time may charge fees for refresher  training courses  for  previously  trained  and  experienced  managers.  Fees for special programs will be based upon Pretzel Time's actual costs and attendance  shall be required. Attendance at retraining programs or seminars shall be at Franchisee's sole expense,  provided,  however,  that attendance will not be required at more than two (2) such  programs  in any  calendar  year and shall  not  collectively exceed ten (10) business days in duration during any calendar year.\n\n         10.F.    OTHER GUIDANCE.\n\n         Pretzel  Time may  advise  Franchisee  from  time to time of  operating problems of the Unit which come to Pretzel Time's attention and, at Franchisee's request but without any liability  therefore to Pretzel Time, Pretzel Time shall furnish to Franchisee guidance in connection with:                             (i)  Methods,  standards,   specifications  and  operating  procedures                utilized by Pretzel Time Units;\n\n          (ii) Purchasing  required  fixtures,  furnishings,  equipment,  signs,                Products, materials and supplies;\n\n          (iii) Advertising and Promotional programs;\n\n          (iv) Employee training; and\n\n          (v)  Administrative, bookkeeping, accounting and general operating and                management procedures.\n\nSuch guidance shall, in Pretzel Time's  discretion,  be furnished in the form of Pretzel  Time's  Operations  Manual,  bulletins  and  other  written  materials, electronic computer messages,  telephone  conversations  and/or consultations at Pretzel Time's offices or at the Unit. Pretzel Time will make no separate charge to  Franchisee  for  such  operating  assistance  as  Pretzel  Time  customarily provides.  From time to time, Pretzel Time may make special assistance  programs available to  Franchisee,  however,  Franchisee  will be required to pay the per diem fees and charges that Pretzel Time  establishes  from time to time for such special assistance programs.\n\n11.      ADVERTISING AND OTHER PROMOTIONS.\n\n         11.A.    PROVIDING OF ADVERTISING MATERIALS.\n\n         Franchisee  and Pretzel Time agree and  recognize  the value of uniform advertising to the goodwill and public image of Pretzel Time Units. Pretzel Time has  instituted  and  maintains and  administers  an  advertising  fund for such advertising  or  public  relations   programs  as  Pretzel  Time,  in  its  sole discretion,  may deem  necessary  or  appropriate  to  advertise  or promote the Pretzel Time System,  nationally or regionally.  Pretzel Time will  periodically provide Franchisee with programs,  promotional  concepts,  and other information designed to enhance the operation of the  Franchise.  In addition,  Pretzel Time may  provide  optional  special  promotions  from time to time  which will be at Franchisee's cost, which may be mandatory. At its initial opening, Pretzel Time, at  Franchisee's  expense,  shall  designate  and supply an initial  quantity of forms,  literature,   display,  and  promotional  materials.  Pretzel  Time,  in consideration of the Advertising Fund Fee, shall periodically provide Franchisee with  camera  ready  advertising  materials.   Multiple  copies  of  advertising materials will be furnished to Franchisee for an additional  fee,  including any related shipping, handling and storage charges.\n\n         11.B.    CONTROL OF ADVERTISING PROGRAMS AND CONCEPTS.\n\n         Pretzel Time shall direct all such programs,  with sole discretion over the creative concepts, materials,  endorsements, and media used therein, and the placement  and  allocation  thereof.   The  manner,   media  and  cost  of  such advertising,  public  relations  and  promotional  mailings  shall be solely and completely  within the  discretion of Pretzel Time.  Pretzel Time shall have the right to determine, in its sole discretion,  the target and market areas for the development  and  implementation  of such  programs.  Pretzel  Time may  expend, disburse and use funds from the Advertising  Fund, in its sole  discretion,  for the following purposes:\n\n                  (1) The  creation  and  development  of nonlocal  advertising,          promotional campaigns,  and public relations to promote and enhance the          value of the Service  Marks and the  business  of all the Pretzel  Time          retail establishments;\n\n                  (2) Payments to Pretzel Time of such reasonable sums as may be          necessary  for actual  costs of  advertising  production,  direct  mail          purchases, and other media marketing tools;\n\n                  (3) Payment of salaries and  benefits  for staff  personnel in          the  marketing  and  public  relations  department  as  well  as  other          administrative  costs and overhead expenses of the department  incurred          by Pretzel Time;\n\n                  (4) The  costs of  employing  advertising,  marketing,  public          relations and promotion  agencies to assist in preparing and conducting          media programs and activities and supporting public  relations,  market\n\n\n\n\n\n         research and other advertising, promotion and marketing activities;\n\n                  (5) Market  research  expenditures  related to the development          and evaluation of the effectiveness of advertising and sales promotion;          and\n\n                  (6)  Costs  of  organizing   and  providing   facilities   for          international, national, or regional franchisee conferences.\n\n         Franchisee  understands and  acknowledges  that the Advertising Fund is intended to maximize  recognition  of the Marks and  patronage  of Pretzel  Time Units.  Although  Pretzel Time will endeavor to utilize the Advertising  Fund to develop   advertising  and  marketing   materials  and  programs  and  to  place advertising that will benefit all Pretzel Time Units, Pretzel Time undertakes no obligation to ensure that  expenditures by the Advertising  Fund in or affecting any geographic area are  proportionate or equivalent to the contributions to the Advertising Fund by Pretzel Time Units operating in that geographic area or that any  Pretzel  Time  Units  will  benefit   directly  or  in  proportion  to  its contribution  to the  Advertising  Fund from the  development of advertising and marketing materials or the placement of Advertising.\n\n         11.C.    SEGREGATION OF ADVERTISING FUND.\n\n         Pretzel  Time  herein   agrees  to   administratively   segregate   the Advertising  Fund on its books and  records.  Fees paid by  Franchisee  into the advertising  fund  shall  not  under any  circumstance  be used for the  general operating  expenses of Pretzel Time but shall and will be used  exclusively  for advertising  as outlined  herein.  Pretzel  Time may spend in any fiscal year an amount greater or less than the aggregate  contributions  of the  franchisees to the fund in that  year and  Pretzel  Time  may  make  loans to the fund  bearing reasonable  interest  to cover  any  deficits  of the fund and cause the fund to invest any surplus for future use by the fund. It is anticipated,  and it is the intent of Pretzel Time that all  contributions to the Fund shall be expended for advertising  and  promotional  purposes during Pretzel Time's fiscal year within which  contributions  are made.  Any monies not  expended  in the fiscal year in which they were  contributed  shall be applied and used for Fund expenses in the following year.\n\n                   11.D. SUSPENSION OF ADVERTISING FUND FEES.\n\n         Pretzel  Time  reserves  the right to  suspend  contributions/fees  and operations of the  Advertising  Fund for one or more  periods,  and the right to terminate the  Advertising  Fund, upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice to Franchisee.  All unspent monies on the date of termination  shall be distributed to Pretzel Time's  franchisees and Pretzel Time, its Affiliates and designees in proportion to their  respective  contributions  to the Advertising Fund upon the same terms and  conditions set forth herein upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice Franchisee.\n\n         11.E.    FRANCHISEE'S REQUIRED ADVERTISING EXPENDITURES.\n\n         In addition to any contributions by Franchisee to the Advertising Fund, Franchisee is required to spend on marketing and related programs such amount as is  required  pursuant  to the terms and  conditions  of  Franchisee's  lease or sublease.  Franchisee  acknowledges  such amounts will vary from lease to lease, and therefore, all Pretzel Time Unit franchisees will not be obligated to expend the same amount on local advertising and marketing of the Unit.\n\n         11.F.    USE OF TRADEMARK REFERENCES AND APPROVAL                   OF FRANCHISEE'S MARKETING.\n\n         Franchisee further agrees that all advertising, promotion and marketing by Franchisee shall be completely clear and factual and not misleading and shall conform to the highest  standards of ethical  marketing and  promotion  policies which may be prescribed from time to time by Pretzel Time.  Franchisee agrees to use the  registration  symbol of \"R\" within a circle (7 ) in connection with its use of the Marks.  Franchisee  agrees to refrain  from any business or marketing practice  which may be  injurious  to the  business of Pretzel Time and the good will associated with the Marks and other Pretzel Time Units.  Prior to their use by  Franchisee,  all  press  releases,  literature,  and  samples  of all  local advertising, marketing, point-of-purchase, and related materials not prepared or previously  approved  by Pretzel  Time shall be  submitted  to Pretzel  Time for approval,  which shall not be unreasonably  withheld.  If written disapproval is not received within twenty (20) days from the date of receipt by Pretzel Time of such  materials,  Pretzel Time shall be deemed to have  approved the  materials. Franchisee  agrees not to use  promotional or advertising  materials  which have been  disapproved  by Pretzel Time or that have not been approved for use within the preceding twelve months.\n\n         In  addition,  any  pamphlets,  brochures,  cards or other  promotional materials  offering  free Products may only be used if prepared by Pretzel Time, unless  otherwise  approved  in  advance by Pretzel  Time.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing, Pretzel Time will give favorable consideration to Franchisee's use of free product cards developed by Franchisee, if the cards clearly state that they may only be  redeemed  at Pretzel  Time Units  owned by  Franchisee.  Franchisee agrees to list and advertise the Franchise in the regular white pages  telephone directories distributed within Franchisee's metropolitan area.\n\n         Franchisee  agrees to distribute and display at Franchisee's  location, literature,  display and promotional  materials  including  special  promotional materials  as  Pretzel  Time may from  time to time make  available.  Franchisee agrees that only those advertising,  promotional  materials,  or items which are authorized  by  Pretzel  Time in  writing  prior to use  shall be used,  sold or\n\n\n\n\n\ndistributed,  and no  alternate  display or use of the Pretzel Time Service Mark shall be made without the prior written permission of Pretzel Time.  Replacement or updated literature, display,  point-of-purchase and promotional materials may be obtained from Pretzel Time for a fee including shipping.\n\n12.      ADHERENCE TO UNIFORM STANDARDS.\n\n         12.A.    STANDARDS AND OPERATIONS MANUAL.\n\n         Franchisee  acknowledges  and agrees that the  operation of the Pretzel Time Unit in accordance with the specifications, standards, operating procedures and rules Pretzel Time prescribes for the operation of Pretzel Time Units is the essence of this Agreement and is essential to preserve the goodwill of the Marks and all  Pretzel  Time  Units.  Franchisee  agrees to operate his Unit in strict compliance and adhere to Pretzel Time's Unit design,  signage,  interior  decor, equipment and  inventory  requirements  and rules and  standards and  procedures (hereinafter  referred to as \"Standards\") set forth in any Operations  Manual or Training  Manual,  as periodically  modified and supplemented by Pretzel Time in its  discretion  during the term of this  Agreement  (\"Operations  Manual\")  and acknowledges that the same are reasonable,  necessary and essential to the image and success of each Unit and the  Pretzel  Time System and agrees to comply with all such  requirements  and  procedures.

CONFIDENTIALITY OF OPERATIONS MANUAL.\n\n         Pretzel Time will make  available to Franchisee  during the term of the Franchise (1) copy of the Operations  Manual by loaning a copy of the Operations Manual to Franchisee. Franchisee acknowledges and agrees that all manuals loaned to Franchisee contain  confidential and proprietary  material and information of Pretzel  Time  provided  to  Franchisee  is to be  used  by  Franchisee  only in connection  with the  operation of the  franchised  Unit and other  Pretzel Time Units. The Operations Manual contains trade secrets and confidential information and will  remain the  property  of Pretzel  Time and shall be  returned to it on termination of this Agreement.  Franchisee  covenants not to reveal the contents of the Operations  Manual to  unauthorized  persons.  Franchisee may not, at any time,  copy the Operations  Manual,  in whole or in part,  either  physically or electronically. In the event Franchisee's copy of the Operations Manual is lost, destroyed or significantly damaged, Franchisee shall be obligated to obtain from Pretzel Time, at Pretzel Time's then applicable  charge,  a replacement  copy of the Operations Manual.\n\n         12.C.    INCORPORATION OF OPERATIONS MANUAL INTO AGREEMENT.\n\n         The  Operations  Manual's  specifications,   standards,  and  operating procedures  communicated to Franchisee in writing shall be deemed a part of this Agreement and are  incorporated  herein by  reference.  Such  Operations  Manual provisions and all reasonable  modifications shall be binding upon Franchisee to the same extent as if set forth verbatim in this Franchise  Agreement,  and such provisions  may be  changed  from  time to time by  Pretzel  Time,  in its  sole discretion,  provided that changes are  reasonably  designed to enhance  Pretzel Time's  Products,  the Pretzel  Time  System,  or  franchise  operation  and are uniformly  applied  with  respect  to all  franchisees.  Any  administrative  or financial  Section set forth in the  Operations  Manual shall be in addition to, and not in derogation or limitation  of, any right or remedy  granted to Pretzel Time  under  the  Franchise  Agreement,  the  Operations  Manual,  or any  other document,  or  otherwise  available  to  Pretzel  Time,  at  law  or in  equity, including,  without limitation,  the right to terminate a franchise in the event of certain defaults or delinquencies.\n\n         12.D.    MODIFICATIONS/UPDATES OF OPERATIONS MANUAL.\n\n          Franchisee  understands  and agrees  that the  Pretzel  Time System is constantly  being  modified  and  improved,  and  that  such  modifications  and improvements  require  changes  from time to time in the  system of  operations. Franchisee  further  agrees  to  accept  and  comply  with  such  modifications, revisions,  and additions to the Pretzel Time System and Operations Manual which Pretzel Time in the good faith exercise of its judgment believes to be desirable and reasonably necessary in the time period indicated by Pretzel Time.\n\n         Franchisee  agrees  that  Standards  may be  periodically  modified  by Pretzel  Time and that such  modifications  may  obligate  Franchisee  to invest additional capital in the Unit and/or incur higher operating costs. Pretzel Time will not obligate  Franchisee to invest  additional  capital at a time when such investment cannot in Pretzel Time's reasonable  judgment be amortized during the remaining term of this  Agreement.  Franchisee  hereby agrees that standards and specifications  prescribed  from  time  to  time in the  Operations  Manual,  or otherwise  communicated  to  Franchisee  in  writing  or  electronically,  shall constitute provisions of this Agreement as if fully set forth herein.\n\n13.      UNIT IMAGE AND OPERATION.\n\n         13.A.    CONDITION AND APPEARANCE OF UNIT.\n\n         Franchisee agrees that:\n\n                  (1) neither the Unit nor the Site will be used for any purpose          other than the operation of a Pretzel Time Unit in full compliance with          this Agreement or other agreements with Pretzel Time; and\n\n                  (2)  Franchisee  will maintain the condition and appearance of          the Unit, its equipment, furnishings, fixtures, and signs in accordance          with the  specifications  and standards of Pretzel Time and  consistent          with  the  image  of a  Pretzel  Time  Unit  as a  first-class,  clean,          sanitary,  attractive and efficiently  operated food service  business;          and\n\n                  (3)  Franchisee  will  perform  such  maintenance  (including,          without limitation,  maintenance  procedures and routines which Pretzel          Time  prescribes  from  time  to  time)  with  respect  to  the  decor,\n\n\n\n\n\n         equipment, fixtures,  furnishings,  vehicles, and signs of the Unit and          the Site,  as may be required or directed by Pretzel  Time from time to          time to maintain such condition,  appearance,  and efficient operation,          including, without limitation:\n\n          (a)  continuous  and thorough  cleaning and sanitation of the interior                and exterior of the Unit;\n\n          (b)  thorough repainting and redecorating of the interior and exterior                of the Unit and/or the Site at reasonable intervals;\n\n          (c)  interior and exterior repair of the Unit and/or Site; and\n\n          (d)  repair or replacement of damaged, worn out or obsolete                   furnishings,  equipment,  fixtures  and signs,  provided  that                   Pretzel  Time  will not  require  Franchisee  to  replace  any                   obsolete equipment unless Pretzel Time has initiated a program                   to  replace  such  equipment  as it becomes  necessary  in its                   company-owned Pretzel Time Units; and\n\n                  (4) Franchisee  will not make any material  alterations to the          Site or to the appearance of the Unit as originally developed,  without          prior approval in writing by Pretzel Time; and\n\n                  (5) Upon notice from Pretzel  Time,  Franchisee  shall remodel          and conform  Franchisee's  building design, Trade Dress, color schemes,          and  presentation  of Marks to Pretzel Time's then current public image          within a  reasonable  amount of time,  which  shall not  exceed six (6)          months.  Such a remodeling may include extensive  structural changes to          the Unit  fixtures and  improvements  as well as such other  changes as          Pretzel Time may direct and Franchisee  shall  undertake such a program          promptly upon notice from Pretzel Time;  provided the remodeling  shall          not be  required  until  such time as  Pretzel  Time has  commenced  or          completed a similar  program in at least fifty  percent  (50%) of those          Pretzel Time Units owned and operated by Pretzel Time. This requirement          shall not apply in the  event  notice  from  Pretzel  Time is  received          during the last year of the term hereof or the term of any agreement by          virtue of which Franchisee occupies the Unit.\n\n         In addition to Pretzel Time's rights to terminate this Agreement as set forth herein,  if Franchisee  does not maintain the condition and  appearance of the Unit as herein  required,  Pretzel  Time,  may,  upon not less than ten (10) days'  written  notice  (or, in cases of health or  sanitation  hazards or other public endangerment, immediately on oral or written notice) to Franchisee:\n\n          (i)  arrange  for  the  necessary  cleaning  or  sanitation,   repair,                remodeling, upgrading, painting or decorating; or\n\n          (ii) replace the necessary fixtures, furnishings, equipment, signs.\n\n         If Franchisee  fails or refuses to initiate  within ten (10) days after receipt  of  a  notice  that  the  general  state  of  repair,  appearance,  and cleanliness of your store does not meet Pretzel Time's standards, and thereafter continue in good faith and with due  diligence a bona fide  program to undertake and complete required  maintenance or refurbishing,  Pretzel Time has the right, but is not  obligated,  to enter upon the  premises  of the Unit and effect such maintenance and  refurbishing on Franchisee's  behalf,  and Franchisee shall pay the entire cost thereof to Pretzel Time on demand.\n\n         13.B.  UNIT MENU.\n\n         Franchisee  agrees that the Unit shall offer for sale all  Products and no other  products,  which Pretzel Time, in its sole  discretion,  may authorize and/or require from time to time for the Unit.  Franchisee  agrees that the Unit shall not offer for sale or sell any  Products  or  services at or from the Unit which have not been  approved in writing by Pretzel Time or use the Site or Unit for any purpose  other than the  operation  of a Pretzel  Time Unit.  Franchisee agrees that the Unit shall not sell any  Products at, from or away from the Site until Pretzel Time, in its sole discretion,  has approved the same, provided the foregoing  shall not limit  Franchisee  to sample in front of the lease  line as limited in  Franchisee's  lease.  Pretzel Time  reserves the right to change the types of  authorized  Products and require  Franchisee to offer to sell and sell the  new,  modified  or  substituted  Products.  Pretzel  Time may  develop  new Products,  methods  of  operations,  and  standards  and may  provide  you  with information about developments.  Franchisee also acknowledges and agrees that if Pretzel Time requires the Unit to use new or  substitute  products not currently offered at Pretzel  Time  Units,  Franchisee  agrees to offer such  Products  in compliance  with  Pretzel  Time's   specifications,   standards  and  procedures prescribed in the  Operations  Manuals or otherwise in writing and to diligently pursue  obtaining  any  permits  and  take  such  actions  (including,   without limitation,  constructing  improvements  and  acquiring  fixtures,  furnishings, equipment,  supplies, and materials) required to offer such Products. Franchisee acknowledges  and  understands  that such  modifications  to the  Products to be offered  by the Unit  may  require  Franchisee  to incur  additional  costs  and expenses to operate the Unit, including, without limitation, the purchase and/or lease of additional or substitute furnishings,  furniture, fixtures or equipment and Franchisee agrees to incur such expenses in connection therewith.\n\n         13.C.    ADHERENCE TO APPROVED ITEMS.\n\n\n\n\n\n         The  reputation  and goodwill of all Pretzel Time Units are based upon, and can only be maintained by, the sale of  distinctive,  high-quality  Products and the  presentation,  packaging  and service of Products in an  efficient  and appealing  manner.  Pretzel  Time has  developed  and shall  continue to develop certain  proprietary food products which will be prepared by or for Pretzel Time according to Pretzel Time's recipes and formulas. Pretzel Time has developed and shall continue to develop  standards and  specifications  for fresh  hand-rolled pretzels, frozen pretzels,  pretzel toppings,  beverages and other healthy snack food  products,   materials  and  supplies   incorporated  in  or  used  in  the preparation, baking, or serving of Products authorized by Pretzel Time. The need for quality and quantity control in the Products offered for sale at the Unit is acknowledged  by  Franchisee.  All  Products  offered by  Franchisee  must be of uniform  quality and quantity  and offered for sale to the public in  accordance with Pretzel Time's  specifications  as set forth in Pretzel  Time's  Operations Manual and as may be amended from time to time.\n\n         Pretzel  Time has  approved  and shall  review and  continue to approve suppliers and  distributors  of the  foregoing  Products,  supplies,  materials, equipment,  fixtures  and  machines  that  meet  Pretzel  Time's  standards  and requirements  including,  without  limitation,  quality,  quantity and portions, prices,  output requirements,  distribution methods and locations,  standards of service, financial capability,  customer service and other criteria.  Franchisee agrees that minimum standards for items of inventory,  Products,  machines,  and equipment  may  be  recognized  by  brand  name  rather  than  by  technical  or engineering description.\n\n         Franchisee  agrees  that  it  will  use  all  equipment  and  Products, including, without limitation, food products,  smallwares,  equipment, and paper products as designated by Pretzel Time and shall purchase Pretzel Time's private label  food  products,   materials,  supplies  and  proprietary  food  products, ingredients,  spices, sauces, mixes,  beverages,  materials and supplies used in the  preparation of Products  developed by or for Pretzel Time or its Affiliates whether or not pursuant to a special recipe or formula or bearing the Marks only from Pretzel  Time,  its  Affiliates  or  non-affiliated  sources  designated by Pretzel Time.  Franchisee  further agrees to purchase only from distributors and suppliers  approved  or  required by Pretzel  Time.  Franchisee  agrees that the approved Products, equipment, smallwares, and inventory used on the premises may alter from time to time as Pretzel Time reasonably deems  necessary.  Franchisee agrees to offer for sale only those  Products  approved  by Pretzel  Time and no others without the prior written approval of Pretzel Time. Franchisee shall not, after receipt in writing of any modification of an approved or required supplier or distributor,  manufacturer  of equipment,  products,  materials,  supplies or other items  reorder any product  from any  supplier or  distributor  that is no longer  approved.  Pretzel Time may approve or require a single  distributor  or supplier  for any  Products,  materials or supplies and may approve or require a distributor or supplier only as to certain products, materials and supplies, and such approval may be temporary pending a further  evaluation of such distributor or supplier by Pretzel Time. Pretzel Time may concentrate  purchases with one or more distributors or suppliers to obtain lower prices and/or advertising support and/or  services for the benefit of Pretzel Time, the Pretzel Time System and/or Pretzel Time Units.\n\n         Pretzel Time will loan to Franchisee a list of approved  brand Products for use during the term of this  Franchise  Agreement  at the  initial  training session.  Franchisee  agrees to not copy the list.  Franchisee will,  during the term of this Agreement and after its  termination  or  expiration,  maintain the list  and its  contents  in  strict  confidence,  and  upon  the  expiration  or termination of this Franchise Agreement,  whichever is earlier, will immediately return it to Pretzel Time.  Pretzel Time shall promptly provide  Franchisee with any  amendments to the  designated  list of inventory of available  Products and supplies to be carried and sold at Franchisee's  location.  Franchisee  shall at all times  maintain an adequate  inventory of approved  Products  sufficient  in quality and variety to realize the full potential of the Unit.\n\n         13.D.    EXCEPTION PROCESS.\n\n         If   Franchisee   proposes  to  purchase   materials  or  supplies  not theretofore  approved by Pretzel Time as meeting its  specifications,  or from a supplier or  distributor  not  previously  approved by Pretzel Time,  Franchisee shall first notify Pretzel Time and request  Pretzel  Time's  approval using the special exception form provided to Franchisee in its Operations  Manual, and pay any reasonable fees that Pretzel Time designates therefor.  Further,  Franchisee agrees to use all forms  specified and developed by Pretzel Time for  requesting any exceptions in products or suppliers.  Pretzel Time may require submission of sufficient information and samples to determine whether such materials, supplies or suppliers meet its specifications as well as financial  information regarding the  supplier.  Pretzel Time will advise  Franchisee  within a  reasonable  time whether such\n\nmaterials or supplies meet its specifications.  Pretzel Time does not maintain a formal criteria for approving materials,  supplies or suppliers.  All approvals, disapprovals  and  revocations of approval of suppliers will be  communicated to Franchisee,  in writing,  and shall be in the sole  discretion  of Pretzel Time. Franchisee  must  comply  with  the  following  conditions  in  order  to seek a substitution for a Pretzel Time approved Product:\n\n                  (1) Franchisee  shall submit a written request to Pretzel Time\n\n\n\n\n\n                  for approval of a non-approved supplier or product;\n\n                  (2)  Franchisee  and  supplier  shall  demonstrate  to Pretzel                   Time's  reasonable  satisfaction that it is able to supply the                   commodity  which  meets  Pretzel  Time's   specifications   to                   Franchisee; and\n\n                  (3)  The  supplier   shall   demonstrate   to  Pretzel  Time's                   reasonable  satisfaction that the supplier is of good standing                   in the  business  community  with  respect  to  its  financial                   soundness and the  reliability  of its product and service and                   shall  request  in  writing  to  Pretzel  Time to be  named an                   approved supplier.\n\n         13.E.  PROMOTIONAL ALLOWANCES.\n\n         Franchisee  acknowledges  and agrees that Pretzel Time may, in its sole discretion,  collect  and  retain all  allowances,  benefits,  credits,  monies, payments  or  rebates   (collectively   \"Promotional   Rebates\"),   whether  for promotional,  advertising  or other  purposes,  offered to Franchisee or Pretzel Time or its Affiliates by manufacturers,  suppliers and distributors  based upon Franchisee's  purchases of Products or other products and materials.  Franchisee assigns to Pretzel  Time or its designee all of  Franchisee's  right,  title and interest  in and to any and  all  such  Promotional  Allowances  and  authorizes Pretzel  Time or its  designee to collect any such  Promotional  Allowances  for remission to the general operating funds of Pretzel Time.\n\n14.      FRANCHISEE OPERATIONS.\n\n         14.A.    MANAGEMENT.\n\n         Franchisee agrees that he will at all times faithfully,  honestly,  and diligently  perform his obligations  hereunder,  that he will continuously exert his best efforts and shall  continually  train and  supervise  his  personnel to Pretzel Time's  reasonable  standards,  in  furtherance  of the mutual  business interests of both Pretzel Time and Franchisee and that he will not engage in any other business or activity that may conflict with his obligations  hereunder.  A Unit  shall be under  the  direct,  on-premises  supervision  of a  trained  and competent  Franchisee  or a  trained  and  competent  employee  acting as a Unit Manager  at  all  times.  Franchisee  shall  remain  active  in  overseeing  the operations of the Unit  conducted  under the  supervision  of such Unit Manager. Pretzel  Time shall have the right to deal with the Unit  Manager and  assistant managers on matters  pertaining to the  day-to-day  operations of, and reporting requirements  for the Unit.  Franchisee shall be required to notify Pretzel Time within seven (7) business days of changing Unit Managers.  Franchisee shall hire all employees of the Unit and shall be exclusively  responsible for the terms of their  employment and compensation and for the proper training of such employees in the operation of the Unit.\n\n         If the Unit at any time is not being  managed by you or a Unit  Manager who shall have satisfactorily completed Pretzel Time's training program, Pretzel Time is  authorized,  but is not  required to  immediately  appoint a Manager to maintain  the  operations  of the Unit for you.  Pretzel  Time has the  right to change a reasonable fee for such management  services,  not to exceed our costs, and to cease to provide such  management  services at any time.  Pretzel  Time's right to manage a Unit and obtain  reimbursement  for costs also  applies in the event of your death or disability.\n\n         14.B.  SUFFICIENT WORKING CAPITAL.\n\n         Franchisee shall maintain an adequate sales force to serve properly all customers,  and shall  carry at all times a stock of  merchandise  of such size, character,  quality and price to produce the maximum return to Franchisee and so as to produce all of the gross  revenue  which may be produced by such manner of operation.\n\n         14.C.  FILING OF OPERATIONS AND SALES REPORTS.\n\n         Franchisee's  net revenues and operational  analysis are to be reported on or before Tuesday at 12:00 P.M.

If the gross sales report is not submitted as herein  specified,  Pretzel Time may, at its option,  charge a late fee of $50.00 to Franchisee.  There will only be one late fee for each late report.\n\n         14.D.    EMPLOYEE DRESS AND CUSTOMER SERVICE.\n\n         The  presentation  of an uniform  image is  essential  to a  successful franchise  system.  Franchisee  shall cause all  employees of  Franchisee  while working  at the  franchise  location  to dress  appropriately  (in the  specific uniform  approved and  designated  by Pretzel  Time) in keeping with the Pretzel Time image,  as Pretzel Time may designate  from time to time, to present a neat and clean  appearance  and to render  confident  and  courteous  service  to the Franchise's customers.\n\n         14.E.  COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND GOOD BUSINESS PRACTICES.\n\n         Franchisee  shall secure and maintain in force in his name all required licenses,  permits,  and  certificates  relating to the conduct of his  business pursuant to this  Agreement.  Franchisee  will  conduct the  Franchise in strict compliance  with  all  applicable  laws,  ordinances,   regulations,  and  other requirements  of any federal,  state,  county,  municipal  or other  government, including,   without  limitation,  those  laws  and  regulations  pertaining  to preparation,  purchase  and  handling of food  products,  occupational  hazards,\n\n\n\n\n\nhealth,  safety and sanitation,  worker's compensation  insurance,  unemployment insurance,  and  withholding  and payment of all taxes.  While  Pretzel Time may advise  Franchisee  as  a  courtesy  on  any  applicable  laws,  ordinances,  or regulations,  Pretzel Time  undertakes  no duty to do so and  Franchisee  hereby acknowledges  it is Franchisee's  sole duty to inquire  regarding and concerning all laws,  ordinances,  and  regulations  affecting  the Unit,  its  operations, employees and Franchisee.\n\n         Franchisee shall in all dealings with its customers, suppliers, Pretzel Time, and public officials adhere to high standards of honesty,  integrity, fair dealing and ethical conduct.  Franchisee  agrees to refrain from any business or advertising  practice which may be injurious to the business of Pretzel Time and the goodwill associated with the Marks and other Pretzel Time Units.\n\n         Franchisee  shall notify  Pretzel  Time within three (3) business  days after the commencement of any action, suit, proceeding or issuance of any order, writ, injunction, award or court decree which may adversely affect the operation or financial  condition of Franchisee or the unit or immediately  notify Pretzel Time of any notice of health or sanitation violation.\n\n         14.F.    PAYMENT OF TAXES.\n\n         Franchisee  shall be  solely  responsible  for  payment  of all  taxes, including, but not limited to, real estate, sales, payroll,  franchise,  income, personal  property,  and gross  receipts taxes which are assessed as a result of Franchisee's operation of the Franchise.\n\n         14.G.    SALE OF PRODUCT.\n\n         Franchisee agrees not to sell or offer to sell any materials, supplies, or  inventory  used in the  preparation  of any of the  Products  other  than to Pretzel  Time and that he shall  not  sell,  dispense,  give  away or  otherwise provide without Pretzel Time's prior written consent any product except by means of retail sales in the  franchise  location.  Franchisee  may only sell finished Products  and may not sell any Products to any person or entity  purchasing  the Products for resale.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  Franchisee may offer free samples of  Products  at or  directly  in front of the Unit to retail  customers only.\n\n         14.H.    COOPERATION.\n\n         Franchisee  agrees that he shall  cooperate with Pretzel Time in taking any action, or refraining from any action, which in the judgment of Pretzel Time is  necessary or desirable to promote and enhance the quality of the products of the Franchise location, the service provided by the Franchisee,  or the image of the Franchise in the community.\n\n         14.I.    INSURANCE.\n\n         Franchisee shall maintain at Franchisee's expense, in form, amounts and with insurers  satisfactory  to Pretzel Time,  which  insurers must have an A.M. Best  Company  rating of \"A-\" or better and naming  Pretzel  Time an  additional insured,  insurance  against all types of public  liability with personal injury coverage and property damage coverage. In addition to coverage as aforesaid such insurance  shall  include  coverages as set forth in the  Operations  Manual and shall contain a provision  obligating  all insurers to provide a written  notice Pretzel Time of any  cancellation  or  modification  of coverage at least thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of such modification or cancellation.\n\n         The insurance afforded by the policy or policies  respecting  liability shall  not be  limited  in any  way by  reason  of any  insurance  which  may be maintained  by  Pretzel  Time.  Within  sixty  (60) days of the  signing of this Agreement,  but in no event later than the date on which Franchisee  acquires an interest in the real  property  (by lease or  purchase) on which it will develop and operate the Franchise,  a Certificate of Insurance  showing  compliance with the foregoing  requirements shall be furnished by Franchisee to Pretzel Time for approval.  Such certificate shall state that said policy or policies will not be canceled or altered  without at least thirty (30) days prior  written  notice to Pretzel Time and shall reflect proof of payment of premiums. Maintenance of such insurance  and the  performance  by  Franchisee  of the  obligations  under this Section shall not relieve Franchisee of liability under the indemnity  provision set forth in this  Agreement.  Minimum  limits as required above may be modified from time to time, as conditions require by written notice to Franchisee.\n\n         Should  Franchisee not procure and maintain such insurance  coverage as required  by Pretzel  Time,  Pretzel  Time  shall have the right and  authority, without any obligation to do so, immediately procure such insurance coverage and to charge same to Franchisee,  which charges  together with a reasonable fee for expenses incurred by Pretzel Time in connection with such procurement,  shall be payable by Franchisee immediately upon notice.\n\n         Franchisee  shall fully  cooperate  with Pretzel Time in its efforts to obtain  such  insurance  policies,  promptly  execute  all forms or  instruments required to obtain or maintain such insurance policies, allow inspections of the Unit or vehicles  which are  required to obtain and maintain  insurance  and pay Pretzel Time on demand for any costs or premiums.\n\n         14.J.    SUGGESTED RETAIL PRICES.\n\n         Pretzel  Time  may  from  time to time  advise  or  offer  guidance  to Franchisee  relative to prices for Products  offered for sale by Franchisee that in Pretzel Time's judgment  constitute good business practice.  Franchisee shall not be  obligated  to accept any such advice or guidance and shall have the sole right  to  determine  and to sell  products  at any  price  that it  determines.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhenever Pretzel Time recommends a retail price, such  recommendations are based on Pretzel  Time's  experience  concerning  all factors that enter into a proper price, but such recommendation is in no manner binding on Franchisee and no such advice or guidance  shall be deemed or construed to impose upon  Franchisee  any obligation  to charge any  fixed,  minimum  or  maximum  prices for any  product offered for sale by the Franchise.  Pretzel Time reserves the right to advertise retail  prices of Pretzel Time  Products,  provided  that such retail prices are qualified as \"suggested.\" The parties understand and agree that such advertising shall not be  construed  as  requiring  Franchisee  to adhere to such prices but Franchisee shall have complete freedom to establish retail prices.\n\n15.      ACCOUNTING, REPORTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\n\n         15.A.  ESTABLISHMENT OF ACCOUNTING SYSTEM.\n\n         Franchisee  shall  establish at his own expense a complete and accurate bookkeeping,  accounting,  record keeping and data processing system prepared in accordance with generally accepted  accounting  principles and conforming to the requirements and formats that Pretzel Time prescribes from time to time. Pretzel Time shall provide  Franchisee with forms on which to maintain certain sales and operational  data.  Franchisee  shall furnish to Pretzel Time on said forms that Pretzel Time prescribes from time to time:\n\n         (i) On Tuesday of each week,  a report on the Unit's net  revenues  and          sales and operations for the previous week;\n\n         (ii) Every six calendar month period,  a balance sheet and a profit and          loss statement for the Unit for the previous  semi-annual  period and a          year to-date  statement  of  financial  condition as of the end of such          previous period; and\n\n         (iii) Within  thirty (30) days after  Franchisee's  year end, an annual financial report.\n\nThe reports  required in Section 15.A. (ii) and (iii) if not audited,  should be signed  by the  Franchisee  or its  financial  officer,  attesting  that (1) the reports are true and accurate,  (2) they are prepared in accordance with GAPP on a basis  consistent  with prior periods,  (3) they fully describe and completely disclose the information sought, and (4) the signer has made diligent efforts to ascertain the truth and completeness of the information.\n\n         15.B.   MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS.\n\n         Franchisee  agrees, at all times, he shall keep and maintain  adequate, accurate,  true, and proper records, books, reports, data, and accounts relative to the  franchise  in the English  language  and in  accordance  with  generally accepted accounting principles, and retain the records for a period of three (3) years  after  the date they  were  prepared,  from  which  there may be  readily determined the  information  required in the operating  reports to be filed with Pretzel Time. Such records include, without limitation, daily cash reports, cash receipts  journal  and general  ledger,  cash  disbursements  journal and weekly payroll register,  monthly bank statements and daily deposit slips and cancelled checks;  tax returns,  supplier  invoices,  dated cash  register  tapes,  weekly inventories, sales reports, financial statements and tax returns.\n\n         Franchisee hereby authorizes  Pretzel Time to utilize the data supplied by  Franchisee  under this  Section  in any  publication,  discovery  statement, Offering  Circular,  or  advertisements  related  to the sale of  Franchises  or related  entities  by Pretzel  Time,  anywhere,  at any time,  without  specific compensation therefor.\n\n16.      AUDITS AND INSPECTIONS.\n\n         16.A.    AUDITS.\n\n         Pretzel  Time or its  designee  shall have the right at any time during business  hours and without prior notice to  Franchisee,  to inspect,  audit and copy or the right to cause to be  inspected,  audited and copied,  the  business records,  bookkeeping and accounting  records,  sales and income tax records and returns and other records of the Franchised Business,  including but not limited to,  daily  cash  reports,  cash  receipts  journal  and  general  ledger,  cash disbursements  journal and weekly payroll register,  monthly bank statements and daily deposit slips and cancelled checks; tax returns,  supplier invoices, dated cash register tapes, weekly inventories, sales reports, financial statements and tax returns and the books and records of any  corporation or  partnership  which holds the Franchise  including the personal financial records and tax returns of the Franchisee during and after the term of the Franchise Agreement.  Franchisee agrees to maintain on the premises  all sales and  operational  information  for four weeks.\n\n         Any such  inspection  or audit will take place at a time which will not interfere with  Franchisee's  normal business.  Franchisee shall fully cooperate with Pretzel Time's representatives and independent accountants hired by Pretzel Time to conduct any such inspection or audit.  If Pretzel Time deems  necessary, Franchisee shall deliver to Pretzel Time or its designated  agents copies of all bookkeeping  records not already in the  possession of Pretzel  Time,  including customer  records,  cash  register  tapes,  sales and  purchase  records and tax records,  to enable Pretzel Time or its representative or designee to adequately audit Franchisee's  gross sales.  Franchisee hereby waives any right to withhold tax records relative to the Franchise as privileged information. Each report and\n\n\n\n\n\nfinancial  statement  shall be signed and verified by  Franchisee  in the manner Pretzel Time prescribes.  Pretzel Time reserves the right to require  Franchisee to have audited or reviewed financial statements prepared on an annual basis.\n\n         In the event  that an audit  discloses  that  Franchisee's  actual  net revenues exceed  Franchisee's  reported net revenues by two percent (2%) or more for any thirty day  period,  Franchisee  is  obligated  to pay to Pretzel  Time, within  fifteen (15) days after receipt of the  inspection or audit report,  the royalty of seven percent (7%) and the  Advertising  Fund Fee of one percent (1%) of the amount of such  understatement  plus interest from the date such payments were originally due. The audit will be conducted at the expense of Pretzel Time, provided that if an audit  disclosed an  understatement  of two percent (2%), as described above,  Franchisee will bear the cost of the audit,  including without limitation,  the charges of attorneys  and any  independent  accountants,  their travel   expenses,   room  and  board,   and   compensation  of  Pretzel  Time's representatives  and  independent  accountants.  Providing  that in no case will Franchisee be obligated to pay more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) for such inspection  or audit  costs.  The  foregoing  remedies  shall be in  addition to Pretzel Time's other remedies and rights under this Agreement or applicable law.\n\n         16.B.    RIGHT OF ENTRY AND INSPECTION.\n\n         To determine  whether  Franchisee  and the Unit are complying with this Agreement and with all Pretzel Time's  standards and operations as prescribed by Pretzel Time,  Pretzel Time or its designated agents shall have the right at any reasonable time and without prior notice to Franchisee to:\n\n         a.  Inspect the Unit;\n\n         b. Observe,  photograph  and video tape the Unit's  operations for such          consecutive or intermittent periods as Pretzel Time deems necessary;\n\n         c. Remove  samples of any  Products,  materials or supplies for testing and analysis;\n\n         d.  Interview personnel of the Unit;\n\n         e.  Interview customers of the Unit; and\n\n         f. Inspect and copy any books,  records and  documents  relating to the          operation  of the Unit.  Franchisee  agrees  to  cooperate  fully  with          Pretzel Time in connection with any such inspections, observations,  photographing,  video  taping,  Product  removal and  interviews. Franchisee  shall present to his customers  such comment or evaluation  forms as Pretzel Time periodically  prescribes and shall  participate  and/or request his customers  to  participate  in any surveys  performed by or on behalf of Pretzel Time. At the conclusion of his inspection,  Pretzel Time's field  representative shall prepare a written report which shall contain all of his  observations  and conclusions.  If the field representative  determines that a condition amounting to a default of this Agreement has occurred or exists,  this conclusion shall be promptly communicated to Franchisee and Pretzel Time.\n\n17.      TRANSFER, ASSIGNMENT AND REPURCHASE.\n\n         17.A.  BY PRETZEL TIME.\n\n         This Agreement is fully transferable by Pretzel Time and shall inure to the benefit of any  assignee,  transferee  or other legal  successor  to Pretzel Time's interest  herein.  If Pretzel Time's assignee will perform any of Pretzel Time's obligations under this Agreement,  then that assignee must be financially capable of performing  those  obligations and the assignee must expressly assume and agree to perform  them.  Franchisee  agrees that Pretzel Time shall have the right,  from time to time, to delegate the  performance of any portion or all of its obligations and duties under this Agreement.\n\n         17.B.  BY FRANCHISEE.\n\n         Franchisee  understands  and  acknowledges  that the  rights and duties created by this Franchise Agreement are personal to Franchisee (or if Franchisee is a  corporation  or  partnership,  to its  Owners) and that  Pretzel  Time has granted the Franchise to Franchisee in reliance upon Pretzel Time's  perceptions of the individual or collective character,  skill, aptitude,  attitude, business ability and  financial  capacity of  Franchisee  (or its  Owners).  Accordingly, Franchisee agrees no Transfer shall be made without Pretzel Time's prior written approval.  Any Transfer  without such approval shall constitute a breach of this Agreement  and shall be void and of no  effect.  Pretzel  Time's  consent to the assignment  shall  neither  constitute  a  novation  or change  in  Franchisee's obligations under this agreement,  nor constitute a waiver of any claims Pretzel Time may have  against  Franchisee  (or its  Owners)  nor be  deemed a waiver of Pretzel Time's right to demand the transferee's exact compliance with all of the terms or conditions of this Agreement.\n\n         17.C.  CONDITIONS FOR APPROVAL OF TRANSFER.\n\n         If  Franchisee  is in full  compliance  with this  Agreement  (and,  if Franchisee is a corporation or  partnership,  its Owners are in full  compliance with this Agreement),  Pretzel Time shall not unreasonably withhold its approval of a Transfer that meets all of the following requirements:\n\n         (1) The  transferee  and its  Owners  must  meet  Pretzel  Time's  then          applicable  standards for Pretzel Time Unit  franchisees  and must have          had sufficient business experience,  aptitude,  and financial resources          to operate the Unit;\n\n\n\n\n\n         (2) Franchisee has paid such royalty,  advertising  fund fees,  amounts          owed for purchases by Franchisee  from Pretzel Time and its  Affiliates          and all other amounts owed to Pretzel Time or its  Affiliates and third          party  creditors and shall have  submitted to Pretzel Time all required          reports and statements;\n\n         (3)  Franchisee or the  transferee has paid Pretzel Time's then current          transfer fee to defray expenses  Pretzel Time incurs in connection with          the  transfer,  except that if the  proposed  Transfer  is, to or among          Owners of Franchisee, this provision shall not apply;\n\n         (4) The  Transferee  and/or its Unit  Manager  have  agreed to complete          Pretzel  Time's  training  program to Pretzel Time's  satisfaction  and          prior to the date of transfer;\n\n         (5) The  Transferee  has  agreed  to be bound by all of the  terms  and          conditions of this Agreement and executes a current Franchise Agreement          and other franchise documents, a sublease agreement,  if any, and other          documents required by Pretzel Time;\n\n         (6) Franchisee  (and its  transferring  Owners) have executed a general          release,  in form  satisfactory  to Pretzel Time, of any and all claims          against Pretzel Time and its Affiliates and their officers,  directors,          employees and agents;\n\n         (7) Pretzel Time has approved the material terms and conditions of such          Transfer,  including,  without limitation,  that the price and terms of          payment are not so burdensome as to affect  adversely the  transferee's          operation of the Unit; provided,  however, that Pretzel Time's approval          of such Transfer does not ensure the transferee's  success as a Pretzel          Time Unit  franchisee,  nor should  the  transferee  rely upon  Pretzel          Time's  approval  of such  Transfer in  determining  whether to acquire          Franchisee's  Pretzel Time Unit; (8) If Franchisee  (and/or its Owners)          finances  any  part of the  sale  price  of the  transferred  interest,          Franchisee  and/or its Owners have agreed that all  obligations  of the          transferee  under or pursuant to any  promissory  notes,  agreements or          security  interests  reserved by Franchisee or its Owners in the assets          of the Unit or the Premises shall be  subordinate  to the  transferee's          obligations  to pay royalty and service  fees and other  amounts due to          Pretzel  Time and its  Affiliates  and  otherwise  to comply  with this          Agreement;\n\n         (9) Franchisee (and its Owners) have executed a noncompetition covenant          in favor of Pretzel Time and the transferee agreeing that, for a period          of twelve (12) months commencing on the effective date of the Transfer,          Franchisee,  its  Owners  and  members  of the  immediate  families  of          Franchisee  and each of its Owners will not hold any direct or indirect          interest  as  a  disclosed  or  beneficial  owner,  investor,  partner,          director,  officer manager,  employee,  consultant,  representative  or          agent, or in any other capacity,  in a Competitive  Business located or          operating  within  three (3) miles of the Unit,  and  within  three (3)          miles of any other Pretzel Time Unit;\n\n         (10) If consent is required, the lessor of the Premises consents to the          assignment or sublease of the Premises to the transferee;\n\n         (11)  Franchisee  has complied with all of its  obligations  to Pretzel          Time, its Affiliates,  suppliers,  and distributors,  and Franchisee is          not in default under this Agreement or any other Agreement with Pretzel          Time or Pretzel Time's Affiliates;\n\n         (12)  All  improvements,  including  refurbishings,   remodelings,  new          equipment must be made prior to the Transfer; and\n\n         (13)  Franchisee  (and its Owners) has agreed that he will not directly          or  indirectly  at any time or in any manner  (except  with  respect to          Pretzel Time Units owned and operated by Franchisee)  identify  himself          or any  business  as a current or former  Pretzel  Time  Unit,  or as a          franchisee,  licensee or dealer of Pretzel Time or its Affiliates,  use          any Mark, any colorable imitation thereof or other indicia of a Pretzel          Time Unit in any manner or for any  purpose or utilize  for any purpose          any tradename,  trade or service mark or other  commercial  symbol that          suggests or indicates a connection or association  with Pretzel Time or          its Affiliates.\n\n         17.D.    TRANSFER TO A WHOLLY-OWNED CORPORATION.\n\n         Notwithstanding Section 17.B., if Franchisee is in full compliance with this  Agreement,  Franchisee may transfer this Agreement to a corporation  which conducts no business  other than the Pretzel  Time Unit and in which  Franchisee maintains management control and owns and controls one hundred percent (100%) of the equity  and  voting  power of all  issued  and  outstanding  capital  stock. Transfers of shares of such  corporation  will be subject to the  provisions  of Section 17.C.(2) and 17.C.(8).  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Franchisee  shall  remain  personally  liable  under  this  Agreement  as if the Transfer to such  corporation had not occurred.  The articles of  incorporation, by-laws and other organizational documents of such corporation shall recite that the issuance and  assignment of any interest  therein is restricted by the terms of Section 17 of this Franchise Agreement,  and all issued and outstanding stock certificates  of such  corporation  shall bear a legend reciting or referring to the restrictions hereof.\n\n         17.E.

Failure to transfer the interest in this Agreement or such interest in Franchisee within said period of time shall constitute a breach of this Agreement.\n\n         17.G.    PRETZEL TIME'S FIRST RIGHT OF REFUSAL.\n\n          If  Franchisee  (or its Owners)  shall at any time  determine to sell, assign or transfer for consideration  this Agreement or an Ownership Interest in Franchisee  or the Unit,  Franchisee  (or its Owners)  shall obtain a bona fide, executed  written offer and earnest  money deposit from a responsible  and fully disclosed purchaser (including lists of the Owners of record and beneficially of any corporate  offeror and all general and limited  partners of any  partnership offeror and, in the case of a publicly-held  corporation or limited partnership, copies of the most current annual and quarterly  reports) and shall  immediately submit to Pretzel  Time a true and  complete  copy of such  offer,  which  shall include  details of the payment  terms of the proposed  sale and the sources and terms of any financing for the proposed purchase price. To be a valid, bona fide offer, the proposed purchase price shall be denominated in a dollar amount.  The offer must apply only to an interest in this  Agreement,  Franchisee or the Unit and may not  include  an offer to  purchase  any  other  property  or  rights of Franchisee (or its Owners).  However,  if the offeror  proposes to buy any other property  or  rights  from   Franchisee   (or  its  Owners)  under  a  separate, contemporaneous offer, the price and terms of purchase offered to Franchisee (or its Owners) for the  interest in this  Agreement,  Franchisee  or the Unit shall reflect the bona fide price  offered  therefore  and shall not reflect any value for any other property or rights.\n\n\n\n\n\n          Pretzel  Time  shall  have the right,  exercisable  by written  notice delivered to Franchisee  (or its Owners) within sixty (60) days from the date of delivery  of an exact copy of such  offer to  Pretzel  Time,  to  purchase  such interest for the price and on the terms and conditions  contained in such offer, provided that Pretzel Time may substitute cash for any form of payment  proposed in such offer,  Pretzel Time's credit shall be deemed equal to the credit of any proposed  purchaser and Pretzel Time shall have not less than sixty (60) days to prepare  for  closing.  Without  regard to the  representations  and  warranties demanded by the proposed  purchaser,  if any,  Pretzel Time shall be entitled to purchase such interest subject to all customary  representations  and warranties given by the  Franchisee,  seller of the assets of a business or voting stock of an  incorporated  business,  as  applicable,   including,   without  limitation, representations  and  warranties as to ownership,  condition and title to stock, and /or assets,  liens and  encumbrances  relating to the stock  and/or  assets, validity  of  contracts  and  liabilities  of the  corporation  whose  stock  is purchased and affecting the assets, contingent or otherwise.\n\n         If Pretzel Time exercises its right of first refusal,  Franchisee  (and its Owners)  agrees that,  for a period of twelve (12) months  commencing on the date of the closing,  neither  Franchisee (nor its Owners) shall have any direct or indirect interest  (through a member of the immediate  families of Franchisee or its Owners of  otherwise)  as a  disclosed  or  beneficial  owner,  investor, partner, director, officer, employee, consultant, representative, or agent or in any other capacity in any Competitive Business located or operating within three (3) miles of the Unit,  and/or  three (3) miles of any other  Pretzel Time Unit. The  restrictions  of this Section  shall not be  applicable to the ownership of shares  of a class of  securities  listed on a stock  exchange  or traded on the over-the-counter market that represent two percent (2%) or less of the number of shares of that class of  securities  issued  and  outstanding.  If Pretzel  Time exercises its right of first refusal, Franchisee (and its Owners) further agrees that he will abide by the restrictions of Section 17.C.(13).\n\n          If  Pretzel  Time  does not  exercise  its  right  of  first  refusal, Franchisee or its Owners may complete the sale to such purchaser pursuant to and on the exact  terms of such  offer,  subject to Pretzel  Time's  approval of the Transfer as provided in Section 17,  provided that if the sale to such purchaser is not completed  within 120 days after  delivery of such offer to Pretzel Time, or if there is a  material  change  in the terms of the sale  (which  Franchisee shall  promptly  communicate  to Pretzel  Time),  Pretzel  Time's right to first refusal shall be extended for thirty (30) days after the  expiration of such 120 day period or after the material change in the terms of the sale so communicated to Pretzel Time.\n\n         17.H.    PUBLIC OR PRIVATE OFFERINGS.\n\n         In the event  Franchisee (or any of its Owners)  shall,  subject to the restrictions  and  conditions  of Transfer  contained in Section 17,  attempt to raise or secure funds by the sale of securities (including,  without limitation, common or preferred stock,  bonds,  debentures or general or limited partnership interests) in Franchisee or any affiliate of Franchisee, Franchisee, recognizing that the written information may reflect upon Pretzel Time, agrees to submit any such written information used with respect thereto prior to its inclusion in any registration  statement,  prospectus or similar offering  circular or memorandum and to obtain Pretzel Time's written consent to the method of financing prior to any offering or sale of such securities. Pretzel Time's written consent pursuant to this Section  shall not imply or  constitute  Pretzel  Time's  approval  with respect to the sale of the  securities,  the  offering  literature  submitted to Pretzel  Time or any other aspect of the  offering.  No  information  respecting Pretzel  Time  shall  be  included  in  any  disclosure   document  unless  such information  has  been  furnished  by  Pretzel  Time  in  writing   pursuant  to Franchisee's  written request,  in which Franchisee states the specific purposes for  which the  information  is to be used.  Should  Pretzel  Time,  in its sole discretion, object to any reference to it or its business or to the relationship of  Franchisee  or  a  controlled  affiliate  in  such  offering  literature  or prospectus,  such  literature or  prospectus  shall not be used unless and until Pretzel Time's objections are withdrawn.  Pretzel Time assumes no responsibility whatsoever for any offering.  Franchisee  shall pay Pretzel  Time's  expenses in connection with the offering or proposed offering.\n\n         The prospectus or other literature  utilized in any such offering shall contain the  following  language in  bold-face  type on the first  textual  page thereof:\n\n         PRETZEL  TIME,  INC. IS NOT  DIRECTLY OR  INDIRECTLY  THE ISSUER OF THE          SECURITIES OFFERED HEREBY AND ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY WITH RESPECT TO          THIS OFFERING AND/OR THE SUFFICIENCY OR ACCURACY OF THE INFORMATION SET          FORTH HEREIN,  INCLUDING ANY  STATEMENTS  WITH RESPECT TO PRETZEL TIME,          INC.  PRETZEL TIME,  INC.  DOES NOT ENDORSE OR MAKE ANY  RECOMMENDATION          WITH RESPECT TO THE INVESTMENT CONTEMPLATED BY THIS OFFERING.\n\n         Franchisee  (and each of its Owners)  agrees to  indemnify,  defend and hold harmless Pretzel Time, its parent company, subsidiaries, and Affiliates and their officers, directors, employees and agents from any and all claims, demands and  liabilities,  and all costs and expenses  (including,  without  limitation, reasonable  attorneys' fees) incurred in defending against such claims,  demands or  liabilities,  arising  from the  offer or sale of such  securities,  whether asserted  by a  purchaser  of any such  security  or by a  governmental  agency. Pretzel  Time shall have the right (but not the  obligation)  to defend any such claims,  demands or  liabilities  and/or to  participate  in the  defense of any action to which it is named as a party.\n\n18.      TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT BY FRANCHISEE.\n\n\n\n\n\n         18.A.  FRANCHISEE'S RIGHT TO TERMINATE.\n\n         If  Franchisee is in  substantial  compliance  with this  Agreement and Pretzel Time  substantially  breaches a material provision of this Agreement and (1) fails to cure such  breach  within  thirty  (30) days after  written  notice thereof is delivered to Pretzel Time or (2) if such breach cannot  reasonably be cured  within  thirty (30) days after  Pretzel  Time's  receipt of such  notice, undertake  (within  thirty (30) days after Pretzel Time's receipt of such notice and  continue  until  completion),  reasonable  efforts  to  cure  such  breach, Franchisee may terminate this Agreement. Such termination shall be effective ten (10) days after delivery to Pretzel Time of notice that such breach has not been cured and Franchisee  elects to terminate this Agreement.  A termination of this Agreement  by  Franchisee  for any reason other than a  substantial  breach of a material provision of this Agreement by Pretzel Time, and Pretzel Time's failure to cure  such  breach  as  provided  above  shall  be  deemed a  termination  by Franchisee without cause.\n\n19.      DEFAULT AND TERMINATION.\n\n         19.A.  EXACT AND COMPLETE PERFORMANCE REQUIRED.\n\n         Franchisee  acknowledges that complete  performance of all the terms of this  Agreement  is  necessary  for  the  protection  of  Pretzel  Time  and its franchisees.  It is therefore agreed that complete and exact  performance by the Franchisee  of each of his  promises  contained  herein  is a  condition  to the continuance of this Franchise.\n\n         19.B.    DEFAULT AND RIGHT TO CURE.\n\n         If Franchisee  defaults in the  performance of any of the terms of this Agreement  or the  Operations  Manual,  Pretzel  Time,  in addition to all other remedies  available to it at law or in equity and without prejudice to any other rights or remedies,  may  immediately  terminate  this Agreement by delivering a written notice to Franchisee of any breach of this Agreement and a notice period of  forty-five  (45) days shall be given to  Franchisee,  unless such default is cured by the  Franchisee  within thirty (30) days after written  notice  thereof from Pretzel Time to Franchisee.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  if the default is other  than a failure to pay a monetary  obligation  to Pretzel  Time or to a related  company and of a nature that more than thirty (30) days are  reasonably required to cure,  Franchisee  shall  commence  to cure the default  within said thirty (30) day period and shall proceed with such cure with due diligence  with a view to accomplishing the cure at the earliest possible moment, and within the period,  if any,  designated  by Pretzel Time as the allowable  additional  time within which the cure must be accomplished.\n\n         19.C.  EXTENSION OF NOTICE.\n\n         If any  applicable  law or rule  requires  a  greater  prior  notice of termination,  the prior notice required by such law or rule shall be substituted for the notice requirements herein.\n\n         19.D.  REPEATED BREACHES.\n\n         Further,   notwithstanding  anything  herein  elsewhere  contained,  if Franchisee shall repeatedly fail to comply with the terms of this Agreement,  or any of them,  of any nature,  even though such  failures may be cured within the applicable  grace  periods,  Pretzel Time shall have the right by written notice given to Franchisee  immediately  to declare this  Agreement  terminated,  which right shall be in addition to and without prejudice to any other right or remedy to which Pretzel Time may be entitled  under this  Agreement or otherwise  under applicable law. As used in this Agreement the term \"repeatedly  fail\" shall mean three (3) defaults within any twelve (12) month period, even if the defaults are later cured.          19.E.    EVENTS OF DEFAULT - 30 DAYS NOTICE - CURABLE DEFAULTS.\n\n         The  occurrence of any one of the following  events shall  constitute a default under this Agreement  requiring a 30 day notice period of termination by Pretzel Time to Franchisee:\n\n                  (i) Franchisee  fails to pay money when due to Pretzel Time as                   required  under the Franchise  Agreement,  including,  without                   limitation,  the franchise  fee, the renewal fee, the transfer                   fee, royalties, and the advertising fund fee;

or\n\n                  (iii) If Franchisee  fails to submit to Pretzel Time financial                   or other  information  when required  under this  Agreement or                   submits a financial statement which materially understates net                   revenues;

Failure  to                   relocate to other Pretzel  Time-approved  premises  within the                   time specified in this Agreement  after loss of possession due                   to eminent  domain,  destruction of premises or termination of                   lease without  Franchisee's  fault shall  constitute an act of                   Default with no right to cure and immediate  termination  upon                   notice; or\n\n                  (viii) The existence of an imminent danger to public health or                   safety or fails or refuses to comply with  standards  relating                   to the  cleanliness  or sanitation of the Unit or violates any                   health, safety or sanitation,  law ordinance or regulation and                   does not correct such  noncompliance  within  forty-eight (48)                   hours after written notice thereof is delivered to Franchisee;                   or\n\n                  (ix) The loss of the right to occupy the  premises  from which                   the  franchise  is  operated by either  Franchisee  or Pretzel                   Time; or\n\n                    (x) Material  falsification  of business records and reports                     required by Pretzel Time; or\n\n                  (xi)  Franchisee  (or any of its Owners) makes an  assignment,                   surrenders  or  transfers  control of the Unit's  operation in                   violation of this Agreement; or\n\n                  (xii)  Franchisee (or any of its Owners) has made any material                   misrepresentation  or  omission  in the  application  for  the                   Franchise or in materials submitted relating to a transfer; or\n\n                  (xiii)  Franchisee,  (or  its  Owners)  or  members  of  their                   immediate  family violate the restrictions on the operation of                   Competitive Businesses during the term of this Agreement; or\n\n                  (xiv)  Franchisee (or any of its Owners or employees) makes an                   unauthorized  use or disclosure  of or duplicates  any copy of\n\n\n\n\n\n                  any Confidential  Information or uses, duplicates or discloses                   any  portion of the  Operations  Manual in  violation  of this                   Agreement; or\n\n                  (xv) Failure on two (2) or more separate  occasions within any                   period  of  twelve  (12)  consecutive  months  or on three (3)                   occasions during the term of this Agreement to submit when due                   reports or other data, information or supporting records or to                   pay when due the  Royalty  and fees or other  payments  due to                   Pretzel Time or its  Affiliates  or otherwise  fails to comply                   with this  Agreement,  whether or not such  failures to comply                   with this Agreement,  Advertising Fund Fee are corrected after                   notice thereof is delivered to Franchisee; or\n\n                  (xvi) Fails to cure a default under this Agreement  within the                   time specified or provide proof  acceptable to Pretzel Time of                   efforts  which  are  reasonably  calculated  to  correct  such                   failure within a reasonable  time,  which shall in no event be                   more than sixty (60) days after such  notice,  if such failure                   cannot  reasonably be corrected  within twenty (20) days after                   written  notice of such  notice of  default  is  delivered  to                   Franchisee; or\n\n                  (xvii) Franchisee terminates this Agreement without cause; or\n\n                  (xviii) Franchisee  understates the Unit's net revenues in any                   report or financial  statement  by an amount  greater than two                   (2) percent; or\n\n                  (xix)  Franchisee  causes or permits to exist a default  under                   the  lease or  sublease  for the Site and  fails to cure  such                   default  within the  applicable  cure  period set forth in the                   lease or sublease; or\n\n                  (xx)  Franchisee  (or any of its Owners) fails on three (3) or                   more separate  occasions within any period of twenty-four (24)                   consecutive  months to comply with this  Agreement  whether or                   not such  failures  to comply are  corrected  after  notice of                   default  is  given,  or  failure  on two (2) or more  separate                   occasions within any period of twelve (12) consecutive  months                   to comply within the same  requirement  under this  Agreement,                   whether or not such  failures  to comply are  corrected  after                   notice of default is given.\n\n20. RIGHTS AND  OBLIGATIONS OF PRETZEL TIME AND FRANCHISEE  UPON  TERMINATION OR EXPIRATION OF THE FRANCHISE.\n\n         20.A.  AMOUNTS OWED.\n\n         Unless otherwise authorized by Pretzel Time in writing, in the event of expiration or termination  of this  Agreement for any reason,  or upon the sale, transfer or  assignment  of the  Franchise by  Franchisee,  all of  Franchisee's rights  hereunder  shall  terminate  and  Franchisee  shall cease to operate the Franchise.  Franchisee agrees to pay Pretzel Time within fifteen (15) days after the effective date of termination or expiration of this Agreement, or such later date that the amounts due to Pretzel Time are  determined,  such  Royalty  Fees, Advertising  Fund Fees,  amounts owed for purchases by  Franchisee  from Pretzel Time or its  Affiliates,  interest  due on any of the  foregoing  and all  other amounts owed to Pretzel Time or its Affiliates which are then unpaid.\n\n         Expiration or  termination  of this  Agreement for any reason shall not affect,  modify, or discharge any note, account receivable,  or debt, contingent or otherwise,  existing or arising under this Agreement, or any prior agreement, contract, or dealing between Pretzel Time and Franchisee.\n\n         20.B.    DISCONTINUANCE OF MARKS.\n\n         Franchisee  agrees to immediately  discontinue  all use of trade names, trademarks,  logotypes,  forms of advertising  and other  commercial  symbols of Pretzel Time, and forms of advertising indicative of Pretzel Time and cancel all assumed  name  registrations.  Franchisee  further  shall  remove or cause to be removed all signs and  structures  indicative  of a Pretzel  Time Unit and shall alter the premises occupied by Franchisee so as to distinguish the same from its former appearance and from a Pretzel Time franchise.  Further,  Franchisee shall discontinue  the use of any and all printed goods and materials using said trade names,  trademarks,  logos and other  commercial  symbols  of Pretzel  Time.  If Franchisee  refuses to comply  with the terms of this  Section 20 after  Pretzel Time  requests  compliance,  Pretzel  Time  shall  have the right to enter  upon Franchisee's  premises  without being deemed guilty of  trespassing or any other offense,  and make or cause to be made such  changes  at  Franchisee's  expense, which Franchisee agrees to pay upon demand.\n\n         Franchisee  agrees to not directly or  indirectly at any time or in any manner (except with respect to other Pretzel Time Units owned by the Franchisee) identify himself or any business as a current or former Pretzel Time Unit, or as a franchisee,  licensee or dealer of Pretzel Time or its Affiliates.  Franchisee further  agrees to not use any Mark,  any colorable  imitation  thereof or other indicia of a Pretzel  Time Unit in any manner or for any  purpose or utilize for any purpose any trade name,  trade or service  mark or other  commercial  symbol that suggests or indicates a connection or association  with Pretzel Time or its Affiliates.  Franchisee (or any of its Owners) agrees after  termination he will not do  business  under any name or in any  manner  that  might tend to give the general  public the  impression  that he is  associated,  affiliated,  licensed, franchised by or related to Pretzel Time.  The Franchisee (or any of its Owners) may not thereafter  use any name,  logo type, or symbol  confusingly  similar to\n\n\n\n\n\nPretzel  Time's  Service  Mark,  logo type or symbol.  If  Franchisee  continues operating a business at the franchised  location it will exert every  reasonable effort to inform the public of his new status,  including a change of  telephone number and advertising materials.\n\n         The Franchise granted to Franchisee  hereunder to sell Products bearing Pretzel Time's Marks does not include the right to sell or advertise for sale of Franchisee's  Franchise itself or of its business location.  No advertisement by Franchisee  or  other  public  solicitation  for  sale of his  interest  in this Agreement  may  include a  representation  of Pretzel  Time's  trademark  or any reference to Pretzel Time or its trademark system.\n\n         20.C.    RETURN OF MATERIALS.\n\n         Franchisee  agrees to return to  Pretzel  Time all  signs,  sign-faces, forms,  invoices,  letterhead,  and  other  materials  containing  any  Mark  or otherwise identifying or relating to a Pretzel Time Unit and allow Pretzel Time, without liability to remove all such items from the Unit. Franchisee also agrees to return all  materials  and  confidential  information  loaned to  Franchisee, including,  without limitation,  all Operations Manuals and Training Manuals and videos. Franchisee agrees to return all materials and supplies identified by the Marks in full cases or  packages  to Pretzel  Time for credit and dispose of all other materials and supplies, but not equipment,  identified by the Marks within thirty (30) days after the effective  date of  termination or expiration of this Agreement.\n\n         20.D.    TELEPHONE COMPANY.\n\n         Franchisee  agrees to notify the  telephone  company and all  telephone directory  publishers of the termination or expiration of Franchisee's  right to use any  telephone  and telecopy  numbers and any regular,  classified  or other telephone  directory  listings  associated  with any Mark and to  authorize  the transfer  thereof to Pretzel Time or at its direction.  Franchisee  acknowledges and agrees  that as between  him and  Pretzel  Time,  Pretzel  Time has the sole rights to and  interest in all  telephone  and  telecopy  numbers and  directory listings  associated  with any Mark.  Franchisee  authorizes  Pretzel Time,  and hereby appoints Pretzel Time and any of its officers as Franchisee's attorney in fact, to direct the telephone company and all telephone directory  publishers to transfer any telephone and telecopy numbers and directory  listings  relating to the Pretzel Time Units to Pretzel Time or at its  direction,  should  Franchisee fail or refuse to do so, and the telephone  company and all telephone  directory publishers  may accept such direction or this agreement as conclusive of Pretzel Time's  exclusive  rights in such  telephone and telecopy  numbers and directory listings  and Pretzel  Time's  authority to direct  their  transfer.  Franchisee agrees to execute a  collateral  assignment  of  telephone  numbers and listings agreement  which is attached hereto as Exhibit G. In no event shall Pretzel Time be responsible  for any charges  incurred by Franchisee and associated  with the telephone company prior to the date of transfer.\n\n         20.E.    CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.\n\n         Franchisee (and its Owners) agrees that upon  termination or expiration of this Agreement, he will immediately cease to use any Confidential Information of Pretzel Time or its Affiliates disclosed to him pursuant to this Agreement in any business or otherwise.  This  provision is also  applicable to the Owners if the Franchise is a corporation or partnership.\n\n         20.F.    LEASING.\n\n         If Franchisee  has leased the  premises,  Pretzel Time may, in its sole discretion  and without any  obligation to do so,  assume the lease.  Franchisee will not be entitled to any refund of the initial franchise fee,  royalties,  or Advertising Fund Fees.\n\n         20.G.    COVENANT NOT TO COMPETE.\n\n         Upon  termination of this  Agreement,  in accordance with its terms and conditions or by Franchisee  without cause, or upon expiration of this Agreement (unless the Franchise is renewed as provided for in this Agreement),  Franchisee and its Owners agree that for a period of TWELVE (12) months  commencing  on the effective  date of  termination  or expiration  or the date on which  Franchisee complies  with this Section,  whichever is later,  neither  Franchisee,  nor its Owners,  nor any person or entity  affiliated  with  Franchisee or  Franchisee's shareholders or partners shall have any direct or indirect  interest  (through a member of the immediate  families of Franchisee or its Owners or otherwise) as a disclosed or beneficial owner, investor,  partner, director,  officer, employee, consultant,  representative,  agent or in any other capacity in any  Competitive Business  located or operating:  (1) at the Site;  (2) within three (3) miles of the Unit;  and/or (3) within  three (3) miles of any other  Pretzel Time Unit in operation  or  under  development  on  the  effective  date  of  termination  or expiration of this  agreement for a period of one year after the  termination or expiration.  The  restrictions  of this Section  shall not be  applicable to the ownership  of shares of a class of  securities  listed  on a stock  exchange  or traded on the over-the-counter market that represent two percent (2%) or less of the  number  of shares  of that  class of  securities  issued  and  outstanding. Franchisee  and its Owners  expressly  acknowledge  that they possess skills and abilities of a general nature and have other  opportunities  for exploiting such skills. Consequently, enforcement of the covenants made in this Section will not deprive the Franchisee or its Owners or shareholders of their personal  goodwill or ability to earn a living.\n\nThe Franchise  Agreement contains a covenant not to compete which extends beyond\n\n\n\n\n\nthe termination of the franchise. Franchisee and its Owners acknowledge that the covenant  not to compete is fair and  reasonable,  and will not impose any undue hardship,  since the Franchisee (and its Owners) has other considerable  skills, experience and education  which will afford him the opportunity to derive income from other endeavors.\n\nNeither  Franchisee  nor any of its Owners shall divert or attempt to divert any business or any customers of any Pretzel Time Unit to any  Competitive  Business or employ or seek to employ any  person who is  employed  by Pretzel  Time,  its Affiliates  or a franchisee  of Pretzel Time nor induce or attempt to induce any such person to leave said  employment  without the prior written consent of such person's employer.\n\n         20.H.  PRETZEL TIME'S RIGHT TO PURCHASE ASSETS OF THE UNIT.\n\n         Upon  termination of this Agreement by Pretzel Time in accordance  with its terms and  conditions or by Franchisee  without cause or upon  expiration of this  Agreement  (unless the franchise  has been  renewed),  Pretzel  Time,  its Affiliates  or  its  assignee  shall  have  the  option  (not  the  obligation), exercisable  by giving  written  notice  thereof within sixty (60) days from the date of such  expiration  or  termination,  to acquire from  Franchisee  all the assets  in the Unit  including  the  equipment,  furnishings,  signs,  leasehold improvements,  usable  inventory  of  Products,  materials,  supplies  and other tangible assets of the Unit and an assignment of the lease for the Unit. Pretzel Time  shall  have the  unrestricted  right to assign  this  option to  purchase. Pretzel Time or its assignee  shall be entitled to all customary  warranties and representations  in  connection  with its  asset  purchase,  including,  without limitation,  representations  and  warranties as to ownership,  condition of and title to assets, no liens and encumbrances on the assets,  validity of contracts and agreements and liabilities  inuring to Pretzel Time or affecting the assets, contingent or otherwise.\n\n         (1) The purchase price for the assets of the Unit shall be equal to the greater of:\n\n                  The sum of the book  value  of the  Unit's  assets  (including                   furnishings,  fixtures, equipment, and leasehold improvements)                   amortized on a straight-line basis over a five (5) year period                   plus the lesser of costs and the then-current wholesale market                   value of all  usable  inventory  of  Products,  materials  and                   supplies (i.e. in good and saleable condition and not obsolete                   or discontinued), or\n\n                  The  product of the Unit's  average  cash flow for the two (2)                   most recently  completed  fiscal years  multiplied by two (2).                   \"Cash  flow\"  represents  the  Unit's  net  revenues  less all                   pretzel  unit-related  costs (i.e., cost of goods sold, labor,                   occupancy   and  other  Unit   expenses)  as  well  as  annual                   administrative  costs of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) and                   royalty and  service  fees,  but not  including  interest  and                   depreciation.\n\n         (2)  Pretzel  Time and its  Affiliates  shall have the right to set off against and reduce the purchase  price by any and all amounts owed by Franchisee to Pretzel  Time and its  Affiliates.  Pretzel  Time may exclude from the assets purchased  hereunder any  equipment,  furnishings,  signs,  usable  inventory of Products,  materials  or supplies of the Unit that Pretzel Time has not approved as meeting its standards for Pretzel Time Unit,  and the purchase price shall be reduced by the  replacement  costs of such excluded  items which are required in the operation of the Unit.\n\n         (3) The  purchase  price  shall be paid in cash at the  closing  of the purchase, which shall take place no later than ninety (90) days after receipt by Franchisee  of Pretzel  Time's notice of exercise of this option to purchase the Unit, at which time Franchisee shall deliver instruments transferring to Pretzel Time or its assignee good and merchantable  title to the assets purchased,  free and clear of all liens and encumbrances  with all sales and other transfer taxes paid by  Franchisee,  and all  licenses  or  permits  of the Unit  which  may be assigned or transferred. In the event the closing of the purchase does not occur within said ninety (90) day period because Franchisee fails to act diligently in connection therewith,  the purchase price shall be reduced by ten percent (10%). Franchisee  further agrees that the purchase  price shall be further  reduced by ten percent (10%) per month for each subsequent  month  Franchisee  fails to act diligently to consummate this  transaction.  In the event that Franchisee cannot deliver clear title to all of the purchased assets as aforesaid, or in the event there are other unresolved  issues, at Pretzel Time's option,  the losing of the sale shall be accomplished through an escrow.  Prior to closing,  Franchisee and Pretzel  Time shall  comply with the  applicable  Bulk Sales  provisions  of the Uniform Commercial Code as enacted in the state in which the Unit is located.\n\n         (4) If Pretzel Time or its assignee  exercises this option to purchase, pending  the  closing of such  purchase,  Pretzel  Time may appoint a manager to maintain the operation of the Unit, at its option,  require  Franchisee to close the Unit during such time period  without  removing any assets.  If Pretzel Time appoints a manager to maintain the operation of the Unit pending closing of such purchase, all funds from the Unit's operation during the period of management by a  Pretzel  Time  appointed  manager  shall be kept in a  separate  fund and all expenses of the Unit, including compensation,  other costs and travel and living expenses of the Pretzel Time appointed  manager,  shall be charged to such fund. As compensation for the management services provided,  Pretzel Time shall charge such fund ten  percent  (10%) of the  Unit's net  revenues  during the period of Pretzel Time's management. Operation of the Unit during any such period shall be for and on behalf of  Franchisee,  provided  that Pretzel Time shall have a duty only to utilize its good faith  efforts and shall not be liable to Franchisee or\n\n\n\n\n\nits Owners for any debts,  losses or obligations  incurred by the Unit or to any creditor  of  Franchisee  for any  merchandise  materials,  supplies  or service purchased by the Unit during any period in which it is managed by Pretzel Time's appointed  manager.  Franchisee  shall maintain in force all insurance  policies required for the Unit until the date of closing.\n\n21.      RELATIONSHIP OF THE PARTIES/INDEMNIFICATION.\n\n         21.A.    EXCLUSIVE RELATIONSHIP.\n\n         Franchisee acknowledges and agrees that Pretzel Time would be unable to protect  Confidential  Information  against  unauthorized  use or disclosure and would be unable to  encourage  a free  exchange of ideas and  information  among Pretzel Time Units if  Franchisees  of Pretzel Time Units were permitted to hold interests in or perform services for a Competitive  Business except as specified in Exhibit C.  Franchisee  also  acknowledges  that Pretzel Time has granted the Franchise to  Franchisee  in  consideration  of and reliance  upon  Franchisee's agreement to deal  exclusively  with Pretzel Time.  Franchisee  therefore agrees that  during the term of the  Franchise  Agreement,  or the period of time which Franchisee operates a Unit under this Agreement,  whichever is shorter,  neither Franchisee  nor  any  Affiliate,  immediate  family  member,  or  in  the  event Franchisee is a corporation\n\nany Owner thereof and member of his immediate  family or in the event  Franchise is a partnership any partner  (general or limited) thereof and any member of his immediate family, shall:\n\n         (1) Have  any  direct  or  indirect  interest  as an  owner,  investor,          partner, director, officer, employee, consultant, representative, agent          or in  any  other  capacity  in any  Competitive  Business  located  or          operating  at the Site or within  three (3) miles of any  Pretzel  Time          Unit  in  operation  or  under  development  on the  effective  date of          termination or expiration of this Agreement, except a Pretzel Time Unit          operated by Franchisee under Franchise Agreements with Pretzel Time; or\n\n         (2) Recruit or hire any employee who, within the immediately  preceding          six (6) month period,  was employed by Pretzel Time or any Pretzel Time          Unit operated by Pretzel Time, its Affiliates or another  franchisee or          licensee  of  Pretzel  Time,   without   obtaining  the  prior  written          permission of Pretzel Time or such franchisee.\n\n         Notwithstanding the foregoing,  Franchisee shall not be prohibited from owning securities  listed on a stock exchange or traded on the  over-the-counter market that represents two percent (2%) or less of that class of securities.\n\n         Covenants contained in this Section shall be construed as severable and independent,   and  shall  be  interpreted  and  applied   consistent  with  the requirements  of  reasonableness.  Any judicial  reformation of these  covenants consistent  with this  interpretation  shall be enforceable as though  contained herein  and shall not affect any other  provisions  or terms of this  Agreement. This non-compete provision may not be enforceable under the laws of your state.\n\n         21.B.  NO LIABILITY FOR ACTS OF OTHER PARTY.\n\n         Franchisee shall not employ any of the Marks in signing any contract or applying  for any  franchise or permit or in a manner that may result in Pretzel Time's  liability for any of Franchisee's  indebtedness or obligations,  nor may Franchisee  use the Marks in any way not  expressly  authorized by Pretzel Time. Except as expressly  authorized in writing,  neither Pretzel Time nor Franchisee shall  make  any  express  or  implied  agreements,  warranties,  guarantees  or representations  or  incur  any  debt in the  name or on  behalf  of the  other, represent that their relationship is other than Pretzel Time and franchisee,  or be obligated by or have any liability  under any  agreements or  representations made by the other that are not  expressly  authorized  in writing.  Pretzel Time shall not be  obligated  for any damages to any person or  property  directly or indirectly  arising out of the  operation of the Unit or  Franchisee's  business authorized by or conducted pursuant to this Agreement.\n\n         21.C.    TAXES.\n\n         Pretzel  Time shall have no  liability  for any  sales,  use,  service, occupation,  excise,  gross receipts,  income,  property or other taxes, whether levied upon Franchisee, the Unit, Franchisee's property or upon Pretzel Time, in connection with the sales made or business  conducted by Franchisee.  Payment of all such taxes shall be Franchisee's responsibility.\n\n         21.D.    INDEMNIFICATION.\n\n         Franchisee   agrees  to  indemnify   and  hold  Pretzel  Time  and  its subsidiaries,  Affiliates, stockholders,  directors, officers, employees, agents and assignees harmless against, and to reimburse them for, any loss,  liability, judgment  or damages  (actual or  consequential)  and all  reasonable  costs and expenses of  defending  any claim  brought  against any of them or any action in which any of them is named as a party (including, without limitation, reasonable accountants,  attorneys' and expert witness fees, costs of investigation,  court costs, other litigation expenses,  damages to Pretzel Time's reputation and good will, travel expenses) which any of them may suffer,  sustain or incur by reason of, arising from or in connection  with  Franchisee's  ownership or operation of the Unit, unless such loss, liability or damage is only due to the negligence of Pretzel  Time  (or  its  Affiliates,  subsidiaries).  Pretzel  Time's  right  to indemnity  under  this  agreement  shall  arise  notwithstanding  that  joint or concurrent  liability  may be  imposed on Pretzel  Time by  statute,  ordinance, regulation or other law.  Franchisee  acknowledges and agrees that any action or inaction by any third party which is not an  Affiliate of Pretzel Time shall not\n\n\n\n\n\nbe attributable to or constitute negligence of Pretzel Time. The indemnities and assumptions of liabilities and  obligations  herein shall continue in full force and effect  subsequent to and  notwithstanding  the expiration or termination of this Agreement.\n\n         Pretzel Time shall notify Franchisee of any claims and Franchisee shall be given the  opportunity  to assume the  defense of the matter.  If  Franchisee fails to assume the defense  within  three (3) days of notice  thereof,  Pretzel Time may defend the action in the manner reasonably appropriate,  and Franchisee shall pay to Pretzel Time all reasonable  costs,  including  without  limitation attorney's  fees,  court  costs,  expert  witness  fees,  travel  and  telephone expenses, incurred by Pretzel Time in effecting such defense, in addition to any such sum which Pretzel Time may pay by reason of any settlement agreed to by the parties or reasonably  negotiated by Pretzel Time in the event  Franchisee fails to assume the defense, or judgment against Pretzel Time.\n\n         21.E.  INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR.\n\n         It is understood and agreed by the parties hereto that Franchisee is an independent contractor and is not an agent, partner, joint venturer, or employee of  Pretzel  Time.  Pretzel  Time and  Franchisee  agree  that  nothing  in this Agreement  is  intended  to  create  a  fiduciary   relationship  between  them. Franchisee  shall have no right to bind or obligate  Pretzel Time in any way nor shall he  represent  that he has any right to do so.  Pretzel Time shall have no control over the terms and conditions of employment of Franchisee's employees.\n\n         In all public records and in his  relationship  with other persons,  on stationery, business forms and checks, Franchisee shall indicate his independent ownership of the  franchised  Unit and that he is a franchisee  of Pretzel Time. Franchisee  shall exhibit on the premises in such places as may be designated by Pretzel  Time,  a Pretzel  Time  approved  notice  that the  franchised  Unit is operated by an  independent  operator and not by Pretzel Time or Pretzel  Time's Affiliates,  which operate company owned  franchises.  Franchisee shall take all legal  steps  such as a  fictitious  name  registration  to ensure  Franchisee's independent business status.\n\n22.      PROTECTION OF TRADE SECRETS.\n\n         22.A.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.\n\n         Pretzel Time  possesses  and will further  develop and acquire  certain confidential  and  proprietary  information  and trade  secrets  relating to the operation  of  Pretzel  Time  Units,  which  includes,  but not  limited  to the following  categories  of  information,  methods,  techniques,  procedures,  and knowledge  developed or to be  developed by Pretzel  Time,  its  consultants  or contractors,  its Affiliates or its designees, and/or franchisees (\"Confidential Information\"):\n\n         (1)  methods,   techniques,   equipment,   specifications,   standards,          policies, procedures, information, concepts and systems relating to and          knowledge  of  and  experience  in  the   development,   operation  and          franchising of Pretzel Time Units:\n\n         (2) site selection criteria;\n\n         (3) marketing and promotional programs for Pretzel Time Units;\n\n         (4) recipes, ingredients,  formulas, mixes, spices, seasonings, sauces,          recipes for, and methods for the preparation,  cooking,  and serving of          the Products;\n\n         (5)  techniques,  formats,  specifications,  systems,  procedures,  and          knowledge of and experience in the development and operation of Pretzel          Time Units;\n\n         (6) knowledge of specifications  for and suppliers of certain Products,          materials, supplies, equipment, furnishings and fixtures;\n\n         (7) sales data and information  concerning  inventory  requirements for          Products,  materials and supplies, and specifications for and knowledge          of suppliers of certain materials,  equipment, and fixtures for Pretzel          Time Units;\n\n         (8) employee selection procedures, training and staffing levels;\n\n         (9) Operations Manual and other Manuals prepared by Pretzel Time; and\n\n         (10) information concerning Product sales, operating results, financial          performance and other financial data of Pretzel Time Units.\n\n         Pretzel Time will disclose such parts of the  Confidential  Information as  Pretzel  Time deems  necessary  or  advisable  from time to time in its sole discretion  for the  operation  of a  Pretzel  Time  Unit to  Franchisee  during training, and in guidance and assistance furnished to Franchisee during the term of the Franchise, and Franchisee may learn or otherwise obtain from Pretzel Time additional  Confidential  Information  of  Pretzel  Time  during the term of the Franchise.  Franchisee acknowledges that the foregoing Confidential  Information is highly  confidential.  Franchisee  acknowledges  and agrees  that he will not acquire  any  interest  in  Confidential  Information,  other  than the right to utilize Confidential Information disclosed to Franchisee in the operation of the Pretzel  Time  Unit  during  the  term of this  Agreement,  and  that the use or duplication  of  any  Confidential  Information  in  any  other  business  would constitute an unfair method of competition. Franchisee, including its directors,\n\n\n\n\n\nofficers,  shareholders,  and partners agree(s) that Confidential Information is proprietary,  includes  trade  secrets  of  Pretzel  Time  and is  disclosed  to Franchisee solely on the condition that Franchisee  agrees,  and Franchisee (and its Owners) does hereby agree, that he:\n\n         (1) shall not disclose any  information  pertaining to the Pretzel Time          System,  directly or indirectly,  to any person,  natural or corporate,          without the express prior written  consent of Pretzel Time.  Franchisee          may disclose to its Unit Manager such  information  deemed necessary to          disclose,  provided  such Unit  Manager  has  agreed to  maintain  such          information in confidence in Pretzel Time's  confidentiality  agreement          and Pretzel Time has received such executed agreement  (attached hereto          as Exhibit H);\n\n         (2) Will not use  Confidential  Information  in any other  business  or capacity;\n\n         (3)  Will  maintain  the  absolute   confidentiality   of  Confidential          Information during and after the term of this Agreement;\n\n         (4) Will not make  unauthorized  copies of any portion of  Confidential          Information disclosed in written or other tangible form; and\n\n         (5) Will adopt and implement  all  reasonable  procedures  that Pretzel          Time  prescribes  from  time  to time to  prevent  unauthorized  use or          disclosure of Confidential Information,  including, without limitation,          restrictions on disclosure thereof to his employees.\n\n         This  confidentiality  requirement  shall  not apply in a  judicial  or administrative  proceeding  to the extent  Franchisee  is legally  compelled  to disclose such information,  provided Franchisee shall have used his best efforts and shall have afforded  Pretzel Time the  opportunity  to obtain an appropriate protective order or other assurance satisfactory to Pretzel Time of confidential treatment for the information required to be so disclosed.  This restrictions on Franchisee's  disclosure and use of the Confidential  Information shall also not apply to the  disclosure of  information,  methods,  procedures,  techniques and knowledge which are or become  generally  known in the food service  business in the Territory, other than through disclosure (whether deliberate or inadvertent) by Franchisee.\n\n         Notwithstanding   the  foregoing  and  any  other   provision  of  this Agreement,  Franchisee may use the  Confidential  Information in connection with the operation of other Pretzel Time Units (in addition to the Unit)  pursuant to other Franchise Agreements with Pretzel Time.\n\n         22.B.  DISCLOSURE OF IDEAS AND NEW PROCEDURES.\n\n         Franchisee  shall  fully and  promptly  disclose to Pretzel  Time,  all ideas,  concepts,  methods  and  techniques  relating  to  the  development  and operation  of a dessert or snack food  business  conceived  or  developed by the Franchisee  and/or  Franchisee's  employees  during the term of this  Agreement. Franchisee  agrees and grants to Pretzel Time and its Affiliates a perpetual and worldwide  right to use and  authorize  other  Pretzel  Time Units or other food service businesses  operated by Pretzel Time or its Affiliates,  franchisees and designees  to  use  such  ideas,  recipes,  formulas,   concepts,  methods,  and techniques  relating to the development  and/or  operation of a dessert or snack food business.  If incorporated into the Pretzel Time System for the development and/or operation of Pretzel Time Units, such ideas, recipes, formulas, concepts, methods and techniques  shall become the sole and exclusive  property of Pretzel Time without any further consideration to Franchisee. Pretzel Time shall have no obligation to make any lump sum or on-going  payments to Franchisee with respect to any such idea, concept, method, technique or product.  Franchisee agrees that Franchisee  will not use nor will it allow any other person or entity to use any such concept,  method,  technique or product  without  obtaining  Pretzel Time's prior written approval.\n\n23.      ENFORCEMENT.\n\n         23.A.

RIGHTS OF PARTIES ARE CUMULATIVE.\n\n         The rights of Pretzel Time and Franchisee  hereunder are cumulative and no exercise or  enforcement by Pretzel Time or Franchisee of any right or remedy hereunder  shall  preclude  the  exercise  or  enforcement  by  Pretzel  Time or Franchisee  of any  other  right  or  remedy  herein  or which  Pretzel  Time or Franchisee is entitled by law to enforce.\n\n         23.C.    WAIVER OF OBLIGATIONS.\n\n         Pretzel Time may by written instrument unilaterally waive or reduce any obligation  of  or  restriction  upon  Franchisee  under  this  Agreement,   and Franchisee may by written instrument unilaterally waive or reduce any obligation of or  restriction  upon  Pretzel  Time under  this  Agreement,  effective  upon delivery of written  notice  thereof to the other or such other  effective  date stated on the notice of waiver.  Whenever this Agreement requires Pretzel Time's\n\n\n\n\n\nprior  approval  or  consent,  Franchisee  shall make a timely  written  request therefore, and such approval shall be obtained in writing. Pretzel Time makes no warranties  or  guaranties  upon  which  Franchisee  may rely,  and  assumes  no liability or  obligation  to  Franchisee,  by granting  any waiver,  approval or consent to  Franchisee,  or by reason of any  neglect,  delay,  or denial of any request therefore. Any waiver granted by Pretzel Time shall be without prejudice to any other rights Pretzel Time may have, will be subject\n\nto continuing review by Pretzel Time, and may be revoked, in Pretzel Time's sole discretion,  at any  time  and  for  any  reason,  effective  upon  delivery  to Franchisee of ten (10) days' prior written notice.\n\n         23.D.    CONTINUING OBLIGATIONS.\n\n          All  obligations of Pretzel Time and Franchisee  which expressly or by their very nature survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement  shall continue  in  full  force  and  effect  subsequent  to and  notwithstanding  its expiration  or  termination  and until  they are  satisfied  or by their  nature expire.\n\n         23.E.    INVALID OR UNENFORCEABLE PROVISIONS.\n\n         If any provisions of this  Agreement,  or its application to any person or  circumstance,  is deemed  invalid or  unenforceable  by a court of competent jurisdiction,  then the remainder of this  Agreement or the  application of such provision  to other  persons or  circumstances  shall not be  affected  thereby, provided,  however,  that if any provision or application  thereof is invalid or unenforceable,  the court shall  substitute a suitable and  equitable  provision therefore  in order to carry out,  so far as may be valid and  enforceable,  the intent and purpose of the invalid or unenforceable provision.\n\n         If any applicable and binding law or rule of any jurisdiction  requires a  greater  prior  notice  of the  termination  of or  refusal  to enter  into a successor Franchise  Agreement to this Agreement than is required hereunder,  or the  taking of some  other  action  not  required  hereunder,  or if,  under any applicable  and binding law or rule of any  jurisdiction,  any provision of this Agreement  or any  standard or procedure  outlined in the  Operations  Manual is invalid or unenforceable,  the prior notice and/or other action required by such law or rule shall be  substituted  for the  comparable  provisions  hereof,  and Pretzel  Time shall  have the  right,  in its sole  discretion,  to modify  such invalid or unenforceable operations procedure or standard to the extent required to be valid and enforceable.\n\n         23.F.  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.\n\n         Franchisee  recognizes and  acknowledges the unique value and secondary meaning  attached to the Pretzel Time system,  its  trademarks,  service  marks, standards of operation and Pretzel Time's property.  Franchisee acknowledges and agrees that any noncompliance with the restrictive  covenants  contained herein, including  without  limitation  those provisions  pertaining to  noncompetition, confidentiality  and the improper or  unauthorized  use of Pretzel  Time's Marks will cause  irreparable  damage to Pretzel Time and its franchisees.  Franchisee therefore agrees that should it violate any restrictive covenant, or threaten to breach the  restrictive  covenants,  then Pretzel Time shall be entitled to both permanent  and temporary  injunctive  relief,  without  bond,  from any court of competent  jurisdiction  in addition to any other remedies to which Pretzel Time may be entitled,  at law or in equity,  under this agreement or otherwise  under applicable law.\n\n         23.G.    APPLICABLE LAW.\n\n         Except to the extent governed by the U.S. Trademark Act of 1946 (Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C.  \"1051 et seq.),  this Agreement,  the other agreements  referred herein,  and the offer and the sale of the  franchise  shall be  governed in all respects  and  aspects  by the  laws of the  Commonwealth  of  Pennsylvania  and expressly  excluding  the laws  pertaining  to the choice of law and conflict of laws.\n\n         23.H.    ENTIRE STATUS OF AGREEMENT.\n\n         This Agreement  contains the entire  agreement of the parties and there are no other oral or written  understandings or agreements  between Pretzel Time and Franchisee  relating to the subject matter of this agreement,  except as set forth in Pretzel  Time's  Offering  Circular  required by Rule under the Federal Trade  Commission  Act, a copy of which has been provided to  Franchisee  and of which   Franchisee   acknowledges   receipt,   there  are  no   representations, inducements, promises, agreements arrangements or undertakings, oral or written, between  the  parties  hereto  other than those set forth and duly  executed  in writing.  No agreement of any kind shall be binding upon either party unless and until the same has been made in writing and duly executed by both parties.\n\n         Upon  acceptance  of this  Agreement  by  Pretzel  Time,  all  previous agreements,  contracts,  arrangements  or  understandings  of any kind,  oral or written,  relative to the franchise granted herein are cancelled, and all claims and demands  thereon are fully  satisfied.  This  agreement,  although  drawn by Pretzel Time,  shall be construed  fairly and reasonable,  and not more strictly against one party than against the other party hereto.\n\n         23.I.    AMENDMENT OF AGREEMENT.\n\n         This  Agreement  shall not be  modified  or  amended  except by written\n\n\n\n\n\nagreement  executed by both parties hereto.

CONDITIONS AND CONTINGENCIES.\n\n         The obligations of the parties hereunder are expressly  conditional and contingent  upon the full execution of and performance of all obligations by the parties  under this  Agreement.  This  Agreement is expressly  conditional  upon Franchisee  executing all documents  required by this Agreement  within ten (10) days of receipt of the document.  Failure by Franchisee to execute any documents shall result in the Agreement being null and void.\n\n         In addition during Franchisee's  training,  all documents pertaining to the  franchising of Franchisee as a Pretzel Time Unit shall be held in escrow by Pretzel Time. Title in and to the Pretzel Time Unit shall not pass to Franchisee until  Franchisee  has  been  trained  as  a  Pretzel  Time  franchisee  to  the satisfaction  of Pretzel Time. If Franchisee  fails to  satisfactorily  complete Pretzel Time initial  training,  the appointment of Franchisee as a Pretzel Time franchisee  and the granting of the franchise  business to  Franchisee  shall be null and void, all documents executed between Franchisee and Pretzel Time or its designees with respect to the transaction shall be terminated and cancelled. The Franchisee acknowledges and agrees that no portion of the Franchise fee shall be refunded if Franchisee  fails to complete  Pretzel Time's initial training class to the  satisfaction  of Pretzel Time. If the  Franchisee  completes the initial training to the  satisfaction  of Pretzel  Time,  Pretzel  Time will  provide to Franchisee fully signed copies of the Franchise Agreement.\n\n         It is  understood  and agreed by the parties  that the  granting of the franchise  and all  contracts  and  agreements  entered  into by and between the parties with respect to the Unit are specifically contingent upon the signing of a lease for the Site.  In the event that a lease for the Site cannot be obtained on or before sixty (60) days after  delivery of Pretzel  Time's  approval of the Site at no fault  or delay by  Franchisee,  then all  contracts  and  agreements entered into by Pretzel Time, and  Franchisee  shall become null and void and of no effect,  and all monies  deposited by Franchisee less a nonrefundable  fee of $2,500 shall be refunded.\n\n         23.L.    WAIVER BY PRETZEL TIME.\n\n         No waiver by  Pretzel  Time of any  default  or  failure  to perform by Franchisee,  or of any  breach of the  terms of this  Agreement  or no  failure, refusal or neglect of Pretzel Time to exercise any right,  option or power given it under this Agreement,  shall preclude Pretzel Time from thereafter  requiring strict  compliance or from declaring  this  Agreement and the franchise  granted herein  revoke or  terminated.  The failure of Pretzel  Time to  terminate  this Agreement upon the occurrence of one or more Acts of Default will not constitute a waiver  or  otherwise  affect  the right of  Pretzel  Time to  terminate  this Franchise  because of a continuing or subsequent  failure to cure one or more of the aforesaid events of default or any other default.\n\n         23.M.    COSTS AND EXPENSES OF ENFORCEMENT.\n\n         If a claim  for  amounts  owed by  Franchisee  to  Pretzel  Time or its Affiliates  is  asserted  in any  judicial or  arbitration  proceeding  or later appeal,  or if Pretzel Time is required to enforce the Franchise  Agreement in a judicial or arbitration proceeding or later appeal, the prevailing party will be entitled  to  reimbursement  of its costs  and  expenses,  including  reasonable arbitrators',  accountants'  and  legal  fees,  whether  incurred  prior  to, in preparation for or in contemplation of the filing of any written demand,  claim, action,  hearing or  proceeding  to enforce  the  obligations  of the  Franchise Agreement.  If Pretzel Time incurs  expenses in connection  with your failure to pay when due amounts  owing to Pretzel  Time,  to submit  when due any  reports, information  or  supporting  records or otherwise  to comply with the  Franchise Agreement,  including,  but not limited to legal,  arbitrators'  and  accounting fees, you are required to reimburse Pretzel Time for any such costs and expenses which it incurs.          23.N.    RIGHTS OF PARTIES ARE CUMULATIVE\n\n         THE  RIGHTS  OF  FRANCHISEE  AND  PRETZEL  TIME ARE  CUMULATIVE  AND NO EXERCISE OR  ENFORCEMENT  BY PRETZEL TIME OR  FRANCHISEE  OF ANY RIGHT OR REMEDY HEREUNDER  SHALL  PRECLUDE  THE  EXERCISE  OR  ENFORCEMENT  BY  PRETZEL  TIME OR FRANCHISEE OF ANY OTHER RIGHT OR REMEDY TO WHICH THE PARTY IS ENTITLED.\n\n         23.O.    WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.\n\n     BOTH PRETZEL TIME AND THE  FRANCHISEE  IRREVOCABLY  WAIVES TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM,  WHETHER AT LAW OR IN EQUITY, BROUGHT BY EITHER PARTY.

WAIVER OF PUNITIVE DAMAGES.\n\n         EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO  FRANCHISEE'S  OBLIGATION  TO INDEMNIFY  PRETZEL TIME, THE PARTIES WAIVE TO THE FULLEST  EXTENT  PERMITTED BY LAW ANY RIGHT TO OR CLAIM FOR ANY PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES AGAINST THE OTHER AND AGREE THAT, IN THE EVENT OF A DISPUTE  BETWEEN THEM,  THE PARTY MAKING A CLAIM SHALL BE LIMITED TO RECOVERY OF ANY ACTUAL DAMAGES IT SUSTAINS.\n\n\n\n\n\n         23.Q.  EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION.\n\n         BOTH PRETZEL TIME AND  FRANCHISEE  AGREE THAT ANY ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING  TO THIS  AGREEMENT,  INCLUDING  WITHOUT  LIMITATION,  THE OFFER AND GRANTING OF THE FRANCHISE  RIGHTS  HEREUNDER  SHALL BE INSTITUTED AND MAINTAINED ONLY IN A STATE OR FEDERAL  COURT OF  GENERAL  JURISDICTION  IN DAUPHIN  COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA  OR THE COUNTY IN WHICH PRETZEL TIME MAINTAINS ITS PRINCIPAL  PLACE OF BUSINESS.\n\n         FRANCHISEE  IRREVOCABLY  SUBMITS TO THE  JURISDICTION OF SAID COURT AND WAIVES ANY OBJECTION  FRANCHISEE MAY HAVE TO EITHER THE JURISDICTION OR VENUE OF SUCH COURT.\n\n         23.R.    LIMITATIONS OF CLAIMS\n\n         EXCEPT FOR CLAIMS  BROUGHT BY PRETZEL TIME WITH REGARD TO  FRANCHISEE'S OBLIGATIONS  TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO PRETZEL TIME  PURSUANT TO THIS  AGREEMENT OR TO INDEMNIFY  PRETZEL TIME PURSUANT TO THIS  AGREEMENT,  ANY AND ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS  AGREEMENT  OR THE  RELATIONSHIP  OF  FRANCHISEE  AND PRETZEL  TIME  PURSUANT TO THIS  AGREEMENT  SHALL BE BARRED  UNLESS AN ACTION IS COMMENCED  WITHIN:  (1) TWO (2)  YEARS  FROM THE DATE ON WHICH  THE ACT OR EVENT GIVING  RISE TO THE  CLAIM  OCCURRED  OR (2) ONE (1) YEAR FROM THE DATE ON WHICH FRANCHISEE  OR  PRETZEL  TIME KNEW OR SHOULD  HAVE  KNOWN,  IN THE  EXERCISE  OF REASONABLE  DILIGENCE OF THE FACTS GIVEN RISE TO SUCH CLAIMS,  WHICHEVER  OCCURS FIRST.\n\n24.      ACKNOWLEDGMENTS AND REPRESENTATIONS.\n\n         Franchisee  acknowledges  that he has read this  Agreement  and that he understands  and accepts the terms,  conditions and covenants  contained in this Agreement as being reasonably  necessary to maintain Pretzel Time's high quality and service and the uniformity of those  standards at all Pretzel Time Units and thereby to protect and preserve the goodwill of the Marks.\n\n         Pretzel Time  disclaims  and  Franchisee  acknowledges  that he has not received or relied upon any representations, promises, guarantees or warranties, expressed  or  implied,  made to induce the  execution  hereof or in  connection herewith which is not expressly contained herein or in the disclosure statement. More specifically,  Franchisee  acknowledges and agrees that no person acting on behalf of Pretzel Time or its affiliated  companies has made any written or oral claim,  statement,  assurance,  promise or projection of any sort  regarding the actual  or  prospective  sales,  earnings,  gross  profit  or net  profit of the franchise,  which is the subject of this agreement.  Franchisee acknowledges and agrees that Pretzel Time's officers, directors, employees and agents act only in a representative  and not in a personal capacity in connection with any of their dealings with  Franchisee.  Franchisee  recognizes that neither Pretzel Time nor any other person can guarantee  Franchisee's success in the franchised business. Franchisee  further  represents  to Pretzel  Time, as an inducement to its entry into this  Agreement,  that all statements in  Franchisee's  application for the Franchise   are  accurate  and  complete  and  that   Franchisee   has  made  no misrepresentations or material omissions in obtaining the franchise.\n\n25.

SECURITY INTEREST.\n\n         In order  to  secure  full and  prompt  payment  of the fees and  other charges to be paid by Franchisee to Pretzel Time,  and to secure  performance of the other  obligations  and covenants to be performed by Franchisee,  under this Agreement,  Franchisee hereby grants Pretzel Time a valid and effectual security interest  in,  lien  upon,  and  right of set off  against  all of  Franchisee's interest  in  the  improvements,  fixtures,  inventory,  goods,  appliances  and equipment now or hereafter owned and located at the Unit (whether annexed to the Premises or not) or used in connection with the business  conducted at the Unit, including,  without in any manner limiting the generality of the foregoing,  all machinery,  materials,  appliances and fixtures for  generating or  distributing air, water, heat,  electricity,  light, fuel or refrigeration,  for ventilating, cooling or sanitary purposes, for the exclusion of vermin or insects and for the removal  of  dust,   refuse  or  garbage;   all   engines,   machinery,   ovens, refrigerators,   freezers,  furnaces,   partitions,  doors,  vaults,  sprinkling systems, light fixtures,  fire hoses, fire brackets,  fire boxes, alarm systems, brackets,  screens,  floor tile,  linoleum,  carpets,  plumbing,  water systems, appliances,  walk-in refrigerator boxes, cabinets,  dishwashers,  stoves, set-up tables,  rolling  counters,   kitchen  ranges,  display  counters  and  shelves, humidified  cabinets,  computers and computer software,  and other equipment and installations;  all other and  further  installations  and  appliances;  all raw materials,   work  in  process,  finished  goods  and  all  inventory;  and  all replacements  thereof,  attachments,   additions  and  accessions  thereto,  and products  and  proceeds  thereof  in any  form,  including  but not  limited  to insurance proceeds and any claims against third parties for loss or damage to or destruction  of any or all of the foregoing  (collectively,  the  \"Collateral\"). Without the prior  written  consent of Pretzel Time,  Franchisee  agrees that no lien upon or security  interest in the  Collateral  or any item  thereof will be created or suffered  to be created  and that no lease will be entered  into with respect to any item of Collateral. Franchisee will not sell or otherwise dispose of any item of Collateral,  or remove any Collateral  from the Premises,  unless the same is replaced by a similar item of equal or greater value, and except for the sale of  inventory in the  ordinary  course of  business,  without the prior written  consent  of Pretzel  Time.  Franchisee  agrees to give to Pretzel  Time advance notice in writing of any proposed change in Franchisee's name,  identity or structure and not to make any such change  without the prior written  consent of Pretzel Time and compliance with the provisions of this Agreement. Franchisee agrees  to  execute  for  filing  such  financing  statements  and  continuation statements as Pretzel Time may require from time to time. Pretzel Time agrees to pay all filing  fees,  including  fees for  filing  continuation  statements  in connection with such financing statements.\n\n         26.B.  DEFAULT REMEDIES UNDER U.C.C.\n\n         In the event of a default by Franchisee  under this Agreement,  Pretzel Time  shall  have the  remedies  and rights  available  as a secured  party with respect to the Collateral  under the Uniform  Commercial  Code as in effect from time to time in the  state  where the  premises  are  located.  The grant of the security interest to Franchisee  pursuant to this Section shall not be construed to derogate  from or impair any other rights  which  Pretzel Time may have under this Agreement or otherwise at law or equity.\n\n27.      NOTICES.\n\n         27.A.    DELIVERY OF NOTICES.\n\n         All  written  notices  permitted  or required  to be  delivered  by the provisions  of this  Agreement  or of the  Operations  Manual shall be deemed so delivered to the Franchisee:\n\n         a.

The document appears to be an amendment to the \"Section 2, Part B of the Co-Branding Agreement\" between PC Quote, Inc. (PCQ) and A.B. Watley, Inc. (ABW), but it does not contain any details about exclusivity or prohibitions on collaborating with third parties. The document focuses on the term and effective date of the amendment, and it is signed by the representatives of the two companies, but there are no clauses indicating an exclusive dealing arrangement.
