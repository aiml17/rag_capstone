      "question": "Is a party\u2019s liability uncapped upon the breach of its obligation in the contract? This also includes uncap liability for a particular type of breach such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality obligation.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the context provided in the Cooperation Agreement, there does not appear to be any uncapped liability for a party's breach of the contract. The agreement does not explicitly state that a party's liability is uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.\n\nThe relevant sections are:\n\n1. Clause 5 on Confidential Information, which states that the obligations of confidentiality shall remain in force until the relevant information enters the public domain otherwise than by the default of a party. This suggests there is no uncapped liability for breach of the confidentiality obligation.\n\n2. Clause 4.1 regarding QIWI's obligation to settle transactions through Otkritie's bank. This clause states that if QIWI terminates this obligation, it shall pay a fee to Otkritie, but this fee is capped at RUB 50,000,000. This indicates a cap on liability for breach of this specific obligation.\n\n3. The agreement does not contain any other provisions that suggest uncapped liability for breach of the contract or specific types of breaches. The dispute resolution clause (Clause 9) also does not indicate uncapped damages.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the Cooperation Agreement, the liability of the parties does not appear to be uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.",
      "generated_response": "Based on the provided context, it appears that the contract does not explicitly state that a party's liability is uncapped upon the breach of its obligation. However, the contract does not provide a specific cap on liability either.\n\nIn the context of confidentiality obligations, Clause 5.1 states that \"no party shall, and each party shall procure that their Representatives shall not, disclose to any third party, or use or exploit commercially for its or their own purposes, any Confidential Information.\" If a party breaches this obligation, it is likely that the other party would seek damages for the breach.\n\nHowever, the contract does not specify the amount of damages that can be claimed for a breach of confidentiality obligation. In general, damages for breach of contract are intended to compensate the injured party for their losses, but the amount of damages can vary widely depending on the circumstances of the case.\n\nIn terms of intellectual property (IP) infringement, the contract does not specifically address this issue. However, if a party breaches the contract by infringing on the other party's IP rights, the injured party may be able to claim damages for the infringement.\n\nIn terms of dispute resolution, Clause 9.2 states that any disputes arising out of or in connection with the contract shall be referred to arbitration under the LCIA Rules. The contract does not specify the amount of damages that can be claimed in arbitration, but the LCIA Rules provide for the possibility of awarding damages to the prevailing party.\n\nIn summary, while the contract does not explicitly state that a party's liability is uncapped upon the breach of its obligation, it is likely that the other party would seek damages for a breach of confidentiality obligation or IP infringement. However, the amount of damages that can be claimed would depend on the circumstances of the case and the applicable laws and regulations.",

      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, the franchise agreement contains restrictions on the franchisee's ability to compete with Pretzel Time, both during the term of the franchise agreement and after its termination or expiration.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n1. During the term of the franchise agreement, the franchisee agrees that neither it, its affiliates, nor its owners will have any direct or indirect interest in a \"Competitive Business\" located at the franchise site, within 3 miles of the franchise unit, or within 3 miles of any other Pretzel Time unit in operation or under development (Section 21.A).\n\n2. After termination or expiration of the franchise agreement, the franchisee and its owners agree not to have any direct or indirect interest in a Competitive Business located at the franchise site, within 3 miles of the franchise unit, or within 3 miles of any other Pretzel Time unit in operation or under development for a period of 12 months (Section 20.G).\n\nThe agreement also restricts the franchisee from recruiting or hiring any employees who were employed by Pretzel Time or another Pretzel Time franchisee within the prior 6 months, without Pretzel Time's prior written permission (Section 21.A(2)).\n\nSo in summary, the franchise agreement imposes non-compete and non-solicitation restrictions on the franchisee both during the contract term and for a period after the contract ends.",
      "generated_response": "Based on the provided context, there is no explicit restriction mentioned on a party from contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty. However, the agreement does mention \"Interview customers of the Unit\" which might imply that the party is allowed to interact with customers of the other party, but it does not explicitly state that they can contract or solicit them.\n\nThe closest relevant clause is \"NO LIABILITY FOR ACTS OF OTHER PARTY\" which suggests that one party is not responsible for the actions of the other party. This clause does not directly address the issue of contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided context, it appears that a party is not explicitly restricted from contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty, but it is also not explicitly allowed. The agreement seems to focus more on the consent and approval process and liability for acts of the other party.",
