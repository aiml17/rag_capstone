      "question": "Is a party\u2019s liability uncapped upon the breach of its obligation in the contract? This also includes uncap liability for a particular type of breach such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality obligation.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the context provided in the Cooperation Agreement, there does not appear to be any uncapped liability for a party's breach of the contract. The agreement does not explicitly state that a party's liability is uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.\n\nThe relevant sections are:\n\n1. Clause 5 on Confidential Information, which states that the obligations of confidentiality shall remain in force until the relevant information enters the public domain otherwise than by the default of a party. This suggests there is no uncapped liability for breach of the confidentiality obligation.\n\n2. Clause 4.1 regarding QIWI's obligation to settle transactions through Otkritie's bank. This clause states that if QIWI terminates this obligation, it shall pay a fee to Otkritie, but this fee is capped at RUB 50,000,000. This indicates a cap on liability for breach of this specific obligation.\n\n3. The agreement does not contain any other provisions that suggest uncapped liability for breach of the contract or specific types of breaches. The dispute resolution clause (Clause 9) also does not indicate uncapped damages.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the Cooperation Agreement, the liability of the parties does not appear to be uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.",
      "generated_response": "The provided context does not explicitly state that a party's liability is uncapped upon the breach of its obligation in the contract. However, it does outline the obligations of confidentiality and the circumstances under which Confidential Information can be disclosed. \n\nFor breach of confidentiality, the contract requires the party disclosing the Confidential Information to take all reasonable steps to preserve its confidentiality and ensure it is used only for the purposes for which it has been disclosed (Clauses 5.2 and 5.3). In the event of a request for disclosure in litigation, the party is to give prompt written notice to the other party so that they may seek a protective order (Clause 5.4).\n\nThe contract does not specify a cap on liability for breach of confidentiality or any other type of breach, including IP infringement. Therefore, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the liability for breach of contract, including breach of confidentiality, may be uncapped, as there is no explicit limitation on the amount of damages that can be claimed. However, this would depend on the applicable law and the specific terms of the contract, which are not fully provided in the context.",

      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, the franchise agreement contains restrictions on the franchisee's ability to compete with Pretzel Time, both during the term of the franchise agreement and after its termination or expiration.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n1. During the term of the franchise agreement, the franchisee agrees that neither it, its affiliates, nor its owners will have any direct or indirect interest in a \"Competitive Business\" located at the franchise site, within 3 miles of the franchise unit, or within 3 miles of any other Pretzel Time unit in operation or under development (Section 21.A).\n\n2. After termination or expiration of the franchise agreement, the franchisee and its owners agree not to have any direct or indirect interest in a Competitive Business located at the franchise site, within 3 miles of the franchise unit, or within 3 miles of any other Pretzel Time unit in operation or under development for a period of 12 months (Section 20.G).\n\nThe agreement also restricts the franchisee from recruiting or hiring any employees who were employed by Pretzel Time or another Pretzel Time franchisee within the prior 6 months, without Pretzel Time's prior written permission (Section 21.A(2)).\n\nSo in summary, the franchise agreement imposes non-compete and non-solicitation restrictions on the franchisee both during the contract term and for a period after the contract ends.",
      "generated_response": "Yes, the party (Franchisee) is restricted from competing with Pretzel Time after the contract ends. According to Section 20.G, upon termination or expiration of the agreement, Franchisee and its Owners are restricted from having any direct or indirect interest in a Competitive Business within certain geographic areas (at the Site, within 3 miles of the Unit, or within 3 miles of any other Pretzel Time Unit) for a period of 12 months. This restriction applies to various capacities, including owner, investor, partner, director, officer, employee, consultant, representative, agent, or any other capacity. However, there is no explicit restriction on contracting or soliciting customers or partners during the contract term, but rather a restriction on competing after the contract ends.",
