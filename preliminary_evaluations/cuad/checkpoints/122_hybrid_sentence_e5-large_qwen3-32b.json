Watley, Inc., effective December 9, 1996.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the provided context mentions anything about warranties. The context is an amendment to the Term section.

The amendment might be extending or modifying the term of the agreement, but the user is asking about warranties for defects or errors in the products or services.\n\nLooking at the provided text, the main content is about the amendment to the Term.

The sources cited are from an S-1/A filing, which is a SEC document related to an initial public offering, but again, the excerpt doesn't include warranty terms.\n\nSince the context doesn't provide information about warranties, the answer would be that the duration isn't specified here.

      "question": "Is a party\u2019s liability uncapped upon the breach of its obligation in the contract? This also includes uncap liability for a particular type of breach such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality obligation.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the context provided in the Cooperation Agreement, there does not appear to be any uncapped liability for a party's breach of the contract. The agreement does not explicitly state that a party's liability is uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.\n\nThe relevant sections are:\n\n1. Clause 5 on Confidential Information, which states that the obligations of confidentiality shall remain in force until the relevant information enters the public domain otherwise than by the default of a party. This suggests there is no uncapped liability for breach of the confidentiality obligation.\n\n2. Clause 4.1 regarding QIWI's obligation to settle transactions through Otkritie's bank. This clause states that if QIWI terminates this obligation, it shall pay a fee to Otkritie, but this fee is capped at RUB 50,000,000. This indicates a cap on liability for breach of this specific obligation.\n\n3. The agreement does not contain any other provisions that suggest uncapped liability for breach of the contract or specific types of breaches. The dispute resolution clause (Clause 9) also does not indicate uncapped damages.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the Cooperation Agreement, the liability of the parties does not appear to be uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether a party's liability is uncapped in case of a breach of the contract, specifically including IP infringement or breach of confidentiality. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context to see if there's any mention of liability caps or exclusions. The context given is from a contract's confidentiality clauses (clauses 5.1 to 5.4) and some definitions. \n\nLooking at the confidentiality sections, the main points are about when the obligations don't apply (like when required by law or for performance of the agreement) and the steps to take when disclosure is necessary. There's a mention of cooperation to mitigate effects of disclosure in 5.3 and 5.4 about litigation and protective orders.\n\nBut the question is about liability being uncapped. The context doesn't include any specific clauses about liability limits, damages, or exclusions. The user is asking if the liability is uncapped, meaning there's no cap, so the party could be liable for any amount. Since the provided text doesn't mention any caps or exclusions of liability, the answer would be that the liability isn't capped. However, I should check if there's any other part of the contract (not provided here) that might address this. Since the user only provided the confidentiality and definitions sections, and no other parts, I can't assume there's a cap elsewhere. Therefore, based on the given context, there's no indication that liability is capped, so the answer would be yes, liability is uncapped unless specified otherwise in other parts of the contract not shown here.\n</think>\n\nThe provided context does not include any specific clauses addressing the **cap or limitation of liability** for breaches of the contract, including intellectual property (IP) infringement or breach of confidentiality obligations. The text focuses on confidentiality obligations, exceptions to confidentiality (e.g., disclosure under Applicable Law, litigation, or performance of the agreement), and procedural requirements for such disclosures. \n\nSince there is no mention of liability caps, exclusions, or limitations in the given sections (e.g., Clauses 5.1\u20135.4 or Definitions), **the liability for breaches is not explicitly capped** in the context provided. However, the absence of a cap in these sections does not necessarily mean the entire contract lacks liability limitations\u2014other clauses (not included here) might address this.

The context provided is about a sponsorship agreement, specifically between the Sponsor and the Padres Parties (probably the San Diego Padres or related entities).\n\nLooking through the context, the Sponsor is required to obtain and maintain certain insurance policies. The first point mentions Workers' Compensation and Employers' Liability insurance as per California law. Then there's the Commercial General Liability Insurance with specific coverage limits. The key part here is that these policies must name SDBF, Padres LP, the City of San Diego, and their subsidiaries as Additional Insureds. Also, there's a Waiver of Subrogation in favor of SDBF. \n\nAdditionally, the Commercial General Liability, Automobile Liability, and Umbrella Liability Policies must include Cross Liability Endorsements. The Sponsor has to provide certificates of insurance and give 30 days notice if there's cancellation or modification. The defense of any claims brought against the Padres Parties by the Sponsor must be handled by the Sponsor, allowing the Padres to participate at their expense. \n\nSo, putting this together, the Sponsor is required to maintain insurance that covers not just their own liabilities but also extends coverage to the Padres Parties and related entities. This is for the benefit of the counterparty (the Padres Parties) because if the Sponsor causes an incident, the insurance would cover claims against the Padres. The Additional Insured status means those entities are protected under the Sponsor's policy. The Waiver of Subrogation also benefits the counterparty by preventing the insurance company from pursuing them after paying a claim. \n\nTherefore, yes, there's a clear requirement for the Sponsor to maintain insurance that benefits the counterparty. The answer should confirm this, citing the specific insurance types and the Additional Insureds and Waiver of Subrogation clauses.\n</think>\n\nYes, the Sponsor is required to maintain insurance policies that provide coverage for the benefit of the counterparty (the Padres Parties and related entities).

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the renewal term after the initial term of the agreement expires. The context provided includes several clauses from a contract between a Principal and a Distributor.\n\nFirst, I need to look for any mention of renewal terms. The initial term is stated in clause 10: the agreement is in effect until March 18, 2021, unless terminated earlier with 30 days' written notice. But the question is about what happens after that initial term. \n\nLooking through the other clauses, there's a lot about termination, rights upon termination, and amendments to the agreement. However, I don't see any specific mention of a renewal term or automatic extensions beyond the initial term. Clauses 10 and 11 talk about termination and what happens if the agreement is terminated, but not about renewing the agreement. \n\nThe user is asking if there's an automatic extension or if one party can unilaterally extend with prior notice. The context doesn't mention anything about automatic renewal. The only termination clause is the 30-day notice for termination without cause. There's no indication that the agreement renews automatically after March 18, 2021. Also, there's no mention of unilateral extensions beyond the initial term. \n\nSo, based on the provided context, there's no information about a renewal term. The agreement ends on the specified date unless terminated earlier, but there's no clause about what happens after the initial term expires beyond that. Therefore, the answer should state that there is no renewal term mentioned.\n</think>\n\nThe provided context does not specify a renewal term or automatic extension beyond the initial term of March 18, 2021. The agreement terminates on that date unless terminated earlier by either party with 30 days' written notice (per clause 10). There is no mention of automatic renewal, unilateral extensions, or any process for extending the agreement beyond its initial expiration. The focus of the clauses is on termination rights, obligations upon termination, and product list amendments, but no explicit renewal provisions are outlined. \n\n**Answer:** The context does not state a renewal term or automatic extension beyond the initial expiration date of March 18, 2021. The agreement terminates on that date unless terminated earlier by either party with 30 days' written notice. No unilateral or automatic renewal provisions are specified.",

      "ground_truth_answer": "No, the contract does not contain a license grant to a licensee or the affiliates of such licensee. The contract grants Distributor (GLS LLC) a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use and sublicense the Software provided by Airspan, but it does not explicitly grant a license or rights to any affiliates of the Distributor.\n\nSpecifically, Section 11.1 states:\n\n\"Airspan grants Distributor, and Distributor hereby accepts, a nonexclusive, non-transferable license to use, and to sublicense as set forth below, Software provided by Airspan hereunder only on a single System or unit of Equipment, as may be applicable.\"\n\nThere is no mention of affiliates of the Distributor being granted any license or rights to the Software.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the contract contains a license grant to a licensee, including their affiliates. Let me look through the provided context to find relevant sections.\n\nFirst, I remember seeing something about a license in the context. Let me check the pages again. On Page 14, there's a section labeled 11. SOFTWARE LICENSE. Section 11.1 says: \"Airspan grants Distributor, and Distributor hereby accepts, a nonexclusive, non-transferable license to use, and to sublicense as set forth below, Software provided by Airspan hereunder only on a single System or unit of Equipment, as may be applicable.\"\n\nSo, the license is granted to the Distributor. The key terms here are \"nonexclusive\" and \"non-transferable.\" Also, it mentions the Distributor can sublicense \"as set forth below,\" but the context doesn't show what's in the \"below\" part. However, the question is about whether the license includes the licensee's affiliates. The license here is given to the Distributor, who is the licensee in this case. The sublicense is allowed, but the license itself is non-transferable. \n\nWait, non-transferable usually means you can't transfer the license to another party. But the Distributor can sublicense, which might imply that they can grant sub-licenses to others, possibly including affiliates. However, the license is non-transferable, so the sublicense might be limited. The question is about the license grant to the licensee and their affiliates. The main license is to the Distributor (licensee), and the sublicense is allowed, but the context doesn't explicitly mention affiliates. \n\nLooking at other sections, like 10.6 to 10.9 on Page 13, they talk about Confidential Information and restrictions on disclosure, but not about licensing to affiliates. The main license in 11.1 is to the Distributor. The sublicense is allowed, but the terms of the sublicense aren't detailed here. The question is whether the license includes the affiliates of the licensee/sublicensor. Since the license is non-transferable, the Distributor can't transfer it to affiliates. However, the sublicense might allow it if specified. But the context doesn't mention affiliates in the license terms. \n\nSo, based on the given context, the license is granted to the Distributor (the licensee), and they can sublicense as per the agreement",

(the \"Investment Adviser\"), and [\u25cf] (the \"Remarketing Agent\").\"",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of the contract based on the provided context. Let me look through the context again.\n\nThe context starts with definitions like \"Agreement\" as set forth in the preamble. Then there are sections numbered 7 to 14, and later mentions sections up to 23. The sections include topics like Indemnification, Termination, Amendment, etc. Also, there's a mention of \"Remarketing Agent\" and \"Fund\" in several places. \n\nLooking at the sections listed, there's a part that says \"Section 23. Benefits.\" The last sentence mentions that nothing gives benefits to anyone except the Fund, the Remarketing Agent, and their successors. \n\nThe key part here is the title of the agreement. The context refers to \"This Agreement\" multiple times. The sections listed include terms specific to a Remarketing Agreement, like \"Remarketing Agent's Performance\" in Section 11. Also, there's a mention of \"Remarketing Agreement\" in the line: \"Termination of Remarketing Agreement 12 Section 11.\" \n\nPutting this together, the contract is likely called a \"Remarketing Agreement.\" The preamble probably sets forth the name, and the sections reference it. The fact that sections discuss the Remarketing Agent's duties and the Fund's obligations supports this. Additionally, the mention of \"Tender and Paying Agent Agreement\" in the definition of \"Calculation and Paying Agent\" is a separate agreement, so the main contract here is the Remarketing Agreement. \n\nI don't see any other contract names mentioned in the context. The answer should be \"Remarketing Agreement\" based on the sections and definitions provided.\n</think>\n\nThe name of the contract is the **Remarketing Agreement**. This is evident from references to \"Remarketing Agent,\" sections discussing the termination and performance of the Remarketing Agent (e.g., Section 11: \"Remarketing Agent's Performance\"), and explicit mentions of the \"Remarketing Agreement\" in the context (e.g., \"Conditions to Obligations of the Remarketing Agent\").

      "question": "Is a party subject to obligations after the termination or expiration of a contract, including any post-termination transition, payment, transfer of IP, wind-down, last-buy, or similar commitments?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, based on the information provided in the agreement, there are certain obligations that continue after the termination or expiration of the contract:\n\n1. The provisions of Sections 3.6, 4, 6, 8, 9 and 11 shall survive any termination of the agreement (Section 10.8).\n\n2. Any contract entered into by the Parties with a Marketer for the Product shall survive termination of the agreement in accordance with its terms, including any renewal rights provided therein (Section 10.1). \n\n3. Upon any breach by CAPSUGEL, CARDAX shall be permitted to use all Intellectual Property of CAPSUGEL used in the Formulation and the Product to the extent necessary for the development and marketing of the Product (Section 10.2).\n\n4. Upon any breach by CARDAX, CAPSUGEL shall be permitted to use all Intellectual Property of CARDAX used in the Active Ingredient and the Product to the extent necessary for the development and marketing of the Product in accordance with the terms of the agreement as of the date of such termination (Section 10.2).\n\n5. Each Party shall return to the other Party or to the other Party's designee no later than thirty (30) days after the effective date of termination all of such other Party's property, including all proprietary information, in its possession, except to the extent required to be retained by law or to comply with such Party's continuing obligations (Section 10.7).\n\nSo in summary, yes there are certain post-termination obligations, including the survival of certain provisions, the continuing effect of third-party contracts, and the return of proprietary information and materials.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether a party is subject to obligations after the termination or expiration of a contract, including things like post-termination transition, payment, transfer of IP, wind-down, last-buy, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the provided context. The context includes several sections from the agreement, specifically sections 10.7, 10.8, 11.1, 10.6, 10.7 again, and parts of Section 11. Let me go through each relevant part.\n\nStarting with 10.7 Property: It says that upon termination, each party must return the other's property, including proprietary information, within 30 days, except what's required by law or to comply with continuing obligations. So this directly addresses the transfer of property/IP after termination.\n\nThen 10.8 Survival mentions that certain sections (like 3.6, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11) survive termination. Section 11 includes Miscellaneous provisions, like Dispute Resolution (11.1), which would still be in effect. Also, 11.8 Announcement and others. So survival clauses mean those sections remain active even after termination.\n\nLooking at 11.3 Assignment and 11.4 Waiver, which are part of the surviving sections. Also, 10.6 No Waiver states that not terminating due to a breach isn't a waiver of future rights. This relates to obligations post-termination.\n\nIn Section 10.1 Term and Renewal, it mentions that contracts with a Marketer survive termination. So there's a survival of certain agreements beyond the main contract.\n\nThe question is about whether there are obligations after termination. The answer seems to be yes, based on 10.7 requiring return of property, and 10.8 Survival indicating that some sections (like payment terms, IP transfer) might be part of the surviving obligations. Also, the mention of \"continuing obligations hereunder\" in 10.7 suggests that some obligations persist beyond termination.\n\nAdditionally, the Force Majeure clause in 11.1 (though not directly about termination) might affect performance during termination periods, but that's more about during the contract.\n\nSo putting it all together: Yes, parties have obligations after termination, including returning property (IP transfer",

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if there's an exclusive dealing commitment in the provided context. The context is an amendment to a co-branding agreement between PC Quote, Inc. (PCQ) and A.B. Watley, Inc. (ABW). The amendment is about Section 2, Part B, which is titled \"Term.\" The document mentions that the amendment is effective December 9, 1996, and includes signatures from both parties with dates of December 5 and December 12, 1996.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what an exclusive dealing commitment entails. It usually means that one party agrees to buy all their needs from the other party, or not to deal with others. It could also involve prohibitions on licensing or selling to third parties, or restrictions on collaborating with others during or after the contract.\n\nLooking at the provided context, the main document is an amendment to the Term section. The Term section typically outlines the duration of the agreement, any renewal terms, and possibly termination clauses. However, the context given doesn't include the actual content of the amendment. The user provided the title and some metadata (like the source being an S-1/A filing from 1999) and the signatures from both parties. \n\nThe key point here is that the context doesn't have the body of the amendment. The user's question is about whether there's an exclusive dealing commitment, but the provided text only mentions that this is an amendment to Section 2 (Term) of the co-branding agreement. Without the actual text of the amendment, it's impossible to determine if there are exclusive dealing terms. The Term section might have been amended to extend the agreement's duration or change termination dates, but that doesn't necessarily imply exclusivity. \n\nSince the user is asking based on the provided context, and the context doesn't include the specific language of the amendment, the answer would have to be that there's no information available to confirm an exclusive dealing commitment. The answer should state that the provided context does not contain the necessary details to determine if such a commitment exists. The user might need to refer to the full Co-Branding Agreement or the specific amendment's body for that information.\n</think>\n\nThe provided context does not include the specific language of the amendment to Section 2 (Term) of the Co-Branding Agreement. It only references the amendment's existence, parties involved, effective",
