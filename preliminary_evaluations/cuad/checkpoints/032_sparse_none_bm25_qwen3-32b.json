Then there's a line that says \"AGENCY AGREEMENT\" in all caps. Following that, there's a date: \"___________ __, 2000\". \n\nLooking further down, the document is a letter from the company to Charles Webb & Company, a division of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. The first section is labeled \"Section 1. The Offering.\" The agreement outlines the terms of a stock subscription offering. \n\nThe key part here is the line that says \"AGENCY AGREEMENT\" right after the company's name and before the date. That seems to be the title of the contract. Even though there's a mention of a \"Subscription Offering\" and other sections, the main contract name is likely \"Agency Agreement\" since it's in all caps and centered. \n\nI should confirm that there's no other title mentioned. Scanning through the rest of the text, there's no other contract name listed. The rest of the sections are parts of the agreement, like the offering details. So the answer should be \"Agency Agreement.\"\n</think>\n\nThe name of the contract is **Agency Agreement**. \n\nThis is explicitly stated in the document's header, following the company name and date, and is further confirmed by the context of the agreement between Alamogordo Financial Corporation and Charles Webb & Company.",

(or its subsidiary licensing the software) and the \"Customer\" who is the business entity binding itself to the agreement. The agreement does not mention any third-party beneficiaries who would have rights under the contract.\n\nThe only parties mentioned are Cisco, the Customer, and potentially Government end users who are granted a limited set of rights under the \"Government End User Purchasers\" clause. However, this clause does not appear to confer any enforceable rights to the Government end users beyond the rights already granted to the Customer.\n\nTherefore, the Software License Agreement appears to be solely between Cisco and the contracting Customer, and does not create any rights or ability to enforce the contract for any non-contracting third parties.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out the answer to this question. The user is asking if there's a non-contracting party who is a beneficiary to some or all of the clauses in the contract and can enforce rights against a contracting party.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the provided context, which is a Software License Agreement from Cisco. The key part here is the License section. The agreement states that Cisco grants the Customer a nonexclusive and nontransferable license. The Customer is defined as the business entity represented by the person downloading or installing the software. \n\nNow, the question is about third-party beneficiaries. In contract law, a third-party beneficiary is someone who isn't a party to the contract but can still enforce its terms if the contract was intended to benefit them. The contract here is between Cisco and the Customer. The agreement mentions that by downloading or installing the software, the Customer is bound by the Agreement. \n\nLooking through the terms, there's no mention of any third parties being beneficiaries. The license is specifically granted to the Customer, and the agreement is between Cisco and the Customer. The Documentation is provided for the Customer's use, but there's no indication that someone else outside of Cisco and the Customer has rights under this agreement. \n\nAlso, the refund policy applies only to the original end user purchaser, which reinforces that the Customer is the direct party. There's no clause that extends benefits or rights to another party who isn't a contracting party. \n\nTherefore, based on the information given, there's no non-contracting party beneficiary. The agreement is solely between Cisco and the Customer, and no third party is mentioned as having enforceable rights here.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: No, the Software License Agreement does not indicate the existence of a non-contracting party who is a beneficiary to the clauses. The agreement is explicitly between Cisco and the \"Customer\" (the business entity represented by the user). The license and terms apply solely to the Customer, and there is no language suggesting that third parties (non-contracting parties) are intended beneficiaries with enforceable rights under the agreement. The refund policy and license terms are limited to the original end-user purchaser, further confirming that no third party outside the contracting parties (Cisco and the Customer) is granted rights.",

The key sections to check would be the ones that discuss financial obligations between the parties. \n\nSection 9 talks about rates, stating that unless agreed otherwise, the rates are the maximum rates plus surcharges. There's no mention of profit-sharing or revenue-sharing here. Section 8 mentions the maximum daily quantity, but again, no profit-sharing. \n\nThe term of the contract is from 2014 to 2017, and it's a transportation service agreement. The main obligation here is the transport of gas. The agreement is between a transporter and a shipper, so the primary service is transportation, not the sale of goods or technology. \n\nLooking through all the sections provided, there's no clause that indicates either party must share profits or revenues. The agreement is about transportation services, with the shipper paying the transporter for the service based on the rate schedule.

      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the content license agreement, the intellectual property rights to the Titles do not become the property of the counterparty (Licensee). The key points are:\n\n1. Licensor grants Licensee a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the Titles, but Licensor retains ownership of the Titles (Section 2(a)).\n\n2. Licensee is not granted any ownership rights in the Titles or the Licensor Marks (the logos, trademarks and service marks used to identify the Titles). Licensor only grants Licensee a non-exclusive license to use the Licensor Marks in connection with the Titles (Section 11).\n\n3. There is no provision in the agreement that states the intellectual property rights to the Titles will transfer to the Licensee upon the occurrence of certain events. \n\n4. The agreement states that Sections 2(a), 2(b), 2(c), 2(d), 3, and 11 shall survive the expiration or termination of the agreement (Section 7(c)). This indicates the Licensor retains ownership of the intellectual property rights even after the agreement ends.\n\nSo in summary, the intellectual property rights to the Titles remain the property of the Licensor throughout the term of the agreement and beyond, and do not become the property of the Licensee under the terms of this contract.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether intellectual property created by one party becomes the property of the counterparty under this contract or upon certain events. The context provided is a Content License Agreement between Beijing Sun Seven Stars and YOU ON DEMAND HOLDINGS, INC.\n\nFirst, I need to check the terms of the agreement. The question is about ownership transfer of intellectual property. The answer depends on whether the agreement includes clauses about IP ownership, assignment, or what happens if certain events occur.\n\nLooking through the provided context, the main sections mentioned are Definitions, Terms and Conditions. The specific sections referenced are 5, 9, 13, 14(a), 11, and 4(b). The key terms defined here are things like Additional Title, Advertising, Affiliate, Confidential Information, Indemnified Party, Indemnifying Party, Licensor Marks, Materials, Mobile Sites. \n\nThe question is about IP ownership. The agreement is a license agreement, so typically in such agreements, the licensor grants a license to use the IP but doesn't transfer ownership unless specified. The answer would depend on whether there's a clause about assignment of IP rights. \n\nIn the provided context, there's no explicit mention of assignment of IP. The terms like \"Licensee shall license to Licensee certain video programming\" suggest that the Licensor is granting a license, not transferring ownership. Also, the definitions don't include terms related to ownership transfer. Sections 13 and 14 deal with indemnification and confidentiality, which don't address IP ownership. \n\nSince the agreement is a license, unless there's a specific clause stating that IP becomes the property of the other party, the default is that ownership remains with the creator. The question also asks if there are events that trigger such a transfer, but again, without any mention of such events in the provided sections, it's unlikely. \n\nTherefore, based on the given context, the answer would be that the intellectual property does not become the property of the counterparty. The agreement is a license, not an assignment, and there's no indication of ownership transfer under any conditions.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: Based on the provided context, the Content License Agreement does not indicate that intellectual property (IP) created by one party becomes the property of the counterparty. The agreement is structured as a **license** (not an assignment), where the Licensor grants the Licensee rights to use specific video",

Section Ten of the agreement states that \"from and after the termination of the Contract Period, all of the rights of Company to the use of the name of the NFLA shall cease absolutely and Company subsequently shall not use or refer to the NFLA in advertising or promotion in any manner whatsoever.\"\n\n2. The contract defines the \"Contract Period\" to be a term of 3 years, from November 1, 2017 to November 2, 2020, unless terminated sooner or extended.\n\n3. There is no provision in the contract that indicates the license grant would continue beyond the Contract Period or be irrevocable. The agreement states the rights are granted to the company \"during the Contract Period\" only.\n\nTherefore, the license grant is limited to the 3-year Contract Period and is not irrevocable or perpetual based on the terms of the agreement.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the contract contains an irrevocable or perpetual license grant.

The Recitals mention that the Company wants to use the Pro Football Legends Logo, and the NFLA agrees to license those rights. \n\nNow, the key part is in the definitions or the sections about the license. The Contract Period is defined as three years starting November 1, 2017, and ending November 2, 2020, unless terminated. The term \"irrevocable\" or \"perpetual\" isn't mentioned here. The license seems to be for a fixed term of three years. Also, the mention of \"unless terminated\" suggests that there might be conditions under which it can be ended before the three years, which would mean it's not perpetual. \n\nSince the license is granted for a specific period and there's no indication that it can't be revoked during that time (unless termination clauses exist, which aren't detailed here), the answer would be that it's neither irrevocable nor perpetual. The contract period is time-bound, so it's a term license.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: No, the contract does not contain a license grant that is irrevocable or perpetual. The license is explicitly tied to a defined \"Contract Period\" of three years (November 1, 2017, to November 2, 2020), with the possibility of termination before its conclusion.

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking for the date of the contract based on the provided context. The context is a sponsorship agreement between Sabco Racing, Inc. and Prolong Super Lubricants.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the document to find where the date is mentioned. The very first line after the title says, \"THIS SPONSORSHIP AGREEMENT (hereinafter the 'Agreement) is made and entered into this 19th day of December 1997...\" So that seems like the date when the agreement was signed. \n\nBut wait, the term of the agreement starts with the first race of the 1998 season and ends with the final race of the 2000 season. However, the question is about the date of the contract itself, not the term. The contract was entered into on December 19, 1997. \n\nI should make sure there's no other date mentioned elsewhere that might be relevant. Scanning through the rest of the context, I don't see any other dates related to the signing. The term is from 1998 to 2000, but the actual contract date is December 19, 1997. So the answer should be that date.\n</think>\n\nThe contract was made and entered into on the **19th day of December 1997**, as explicitly stated in the first paragraph of the agreement.",

      "question": "Does intellectual property created\u00a0 by one party become the property of the counterparty, either per the terms of the contract or upon the occurrence of certain events?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the information provided in the software license and maintenance agreement, the intellectual property created by one party (D2 Technologies) does not become the property of the counterparty (Summa Four Inc. or LICENSEE) either per the terms of the contract or upon the occurrence of certain events. \n\nThe key points are:\n\n1. Ownership of Licensed Technology:\n   - Section 2.1 states that \"Subject to the rights granted to LICENSEE in this Agreement, D2 owns all right, title and interest in and to the Licensed Technology.\"\n   - LICENSEE is granted a license to use the Licensed Technology, but does not acquire ownership of it.\n\n2. Modifications by LICENSEE:\n   - Section 2.1 states that \"LICENSEE shall retain all right, title and interest in and to modifications to the Licensed Source Code made by LICENSEE pursuant to the license in Article 2.2 below, subject always to D2's ownership rights in the underlying Licensed Technology.\"\n   - This means that while LICENSEE can make modifications, the underlying Licensed Technology remains the property of D2.\n\n3. Source Code Access Conditions:\n   - Section 7.2 outlines certain \"Source Code Access Conditions\" under which LICENSEE can access the Licensed Source Code.\n   - However, even in these scenarios, LICENSEE does not acquire ownership of the Licensed Source Code. It can only use it for the purposes specified in Section 7.3.\n\nIn summary, the agreement does not transfer the intellectual property rights of the Licensed Technology from D2 to LICENSEE, either automatically or upon certain conditions being met. The Licensed Technology remains the property of D2 throughout the agreement.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether intellectual property created by one party becomes the property of the other party under this contract. The context provided is a Software License and Maintenance Agreement between D2 Technologies and Summa Four Inc.\n\nFirst, I need to check the definitions and the terms of the agreement. The key sections here would be the definitions and any clauses about ownership. The question is about ownership transfer of IP created by either party. \n\nLooking at the definitions in Section 1, they define \"Licensed Technology\" as the software listed in Exhibit A. That suggests that D2 is licensing their existing software to Summa Four, not transferring ownership. The term \"License\" implies that D2 retains ownership, and Summa Four gets the right to use it under certain conditions.\n\nThe agreement mentions a \"Runtime License Fee\" in 2.2(iii), which probably relates to ongoing payments for using the software. There's also mention of maintenance and support services from D2 to Summa Four. These points indicate that D2 is providing a license, not transferring ownership.\n\nI should check if there's any clause about new IP created during the agreement. The question is about IP created by one party becoming the property of the other. The provided context doesn't include sections beyond the definitions and the initial parts. However, in standard license agreements, unless there's a specific assignment clause, the licensor usually retains ownership. \n\nSince the context doesn't mention any assignment of future IP or any events that would transfer ownership, it's likely that each party retains ownership of their own IP. The agreement is about licensing existing technology, not creating new IP jointly or transferring ownership. \n\nTherefore, based on the given information, the answer would be that the intellectual property created by one party does not become the property of the other. D2 retains ownership of the Licensed Technology, and Summa Four is licensed to use it. There's no indication that new IP created by either party during the agreement would transfer ownership unless specified in other parts of the contract not provided here.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: Based on the provided context, the intellectual property created by one party does not automatically become the property of the counterparty under the terms of this Agreement. The document specifies that D2 licenses its **previously developed software** (referred to as \"Licensed Technology\") to Summa Four Inc. for use in their products. Ownership of the Licensed Technology remains with D2, as the Agreement",
