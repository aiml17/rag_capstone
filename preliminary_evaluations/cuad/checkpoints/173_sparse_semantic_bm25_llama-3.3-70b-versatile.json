      "question": "Is a party\u2019s liability uncapped upon the breach of its obligation in the contract? This also includes uncap liability for a particular type of breach such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality obligation.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the context provided in the Cooperation Agreement, there does not appear to be any uncapped liability for a party's breach of the contract. The agreement does not explicitly state that a party's liability is uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.\n\nThe relevant sections are:\n\n1. Clause 5 on Confidential Information, which states that the obligations of confidentiality shall remain in force until the relevant information enters the public domain otherwise than by the default of a party. This suggests there is no uncapped liability for breach of the confidentiality obligation.\n\n2. Clause 4.1 regarding QIWI's obligation to settle transactions through Otkritie's bank. This clause states that if QIWI terminates this obligation, it shall pay a fee to Otkritie, but this fee is capped at RUB 50,000,000. This indicates a cap on liability for breach of this specific obligation.\n\n3. The agreement does not contain any other provisions that suggest uncapped liability for breach of the contract or specific types of breaches. The dispute resolution clause (Clause 9) also does not indicate uncapped damages.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the Cooperation Agreement, the liability of the parties does not appear to be uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.",
      "generated_response": "Based on the provided context, there is no explicit statement that a party's liability is uncapped upon the breach of its obligation in the contract. However, it can be noted that:\n\n* In Clause 5.4, if a party's Affiliate is compelled to disclose Confidential Information, such Affiliate may disclose such portion of the Confidential Information that it is compelled to disclose without liability under this Agreement. This suggests that there may be some limitation on liability for breach of confidentiality obligations.\n* In Clause 4.1, if QIWI terminates its obligation, it shall pay to Otkritie a fee equal to the demonstrated costs incurred by Otkritie, but such fee shall in no event exceed RUB 50 000 000 (fifty million roubles). This implies that liability for termination of this specific obligation is capped.\n* There is no explicit mention of liability for IP infringement.\n\nOverall, it appears that the contract may have some limitations on liability for certain types of breaches, but it is not explicitly stated that a party's liability is uncapped for all types of breaches. Further review of the contract would be necessary to determine the full extent of the parties' liability.",

The provisions of Sections 3.6, 4, 6, 8, 9 and 11 shall survive any termination of the agreement (Section 10.8).\n\n2. Any contract entered into by the Parties with a Marketer for the Product shall survive termination of the agreement in accordance with its terms, including any renewal rights provided therein (Section 10.1). \n\n3. Upon any breach by CAPSUGEL, CARDAX shall be permitted to use all Intellectual Property of CAPSUGEL used in the Formulation and the Product to the extent necessary for the development and marketing of the Product (Section 10.2).\n\n4. Upon any breach by CARDAX, CAPSUGEL shall be permitted to use all Intellectual Property of CARDAX used in the Active Ingredient and the Product to the extent necessary for the development and marketing of the Product in accordance with the terms of the agreement as of the date of such termination (Section 10.2).\n\n5.

Returning the other party's property, including proprietary information, within 30 days of termination.\n4. Maintaining product liability insurance for 2 years after termination or expiration.\n5.

      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, the franchise agreement contains restrictions on the franchisee's ability to compete with Pretzel Time, both during the term of the franchise agreement and after its termination or expiration.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n1. During the term of the franchise agreement, the franchisee agrees that neither it, its affiliates, nor its owners will have any direct or indirect interest in a \"Competitive Business\" located at the franchise site, within 3 miles of the franchise unit, or within 3 miles of any other Pretzel Time unit in operation or under development (Section 21.A).\n\n2. After termination or expiration of the franchise agreement, the franchisee and its owners agree not to have any direct or indirect interest in a Competitive Business located at the franchise site, within 3 miles of the franchise unit, or within 3 miles of any other Pretzel Time unit in operation or under development for a period of 12 months (Section 20.G).\n\nThe agreement also restricts the franchisee from recruiting or hiring any employees who were employed by Pretzel Time or another Pretzel Time franchisee within the prior 6 months, without Pretzel Time's prior written permission (Section 21.A(2)).\n\nSo in summary, the franchise agreement imposes non-compete and non-solicitation restrictions on the franchisee both during the contract term and for a period after the contract ends.",
      "generated_response": "The provided context does not explicitly restrict a party from contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty during the contract. However, it does mention that upon expiration or termination of the agreement, the Franchisee shall cease to operate the Franchise, which implies some restrictions on using the Franchise's assets, including possibly its customer base, after the contract ends.\n\nAdditionally, points e and f seem to be related to interviewing personnel of the Unit and customers of the Unit, but the context is incomplete, and it's unclear if these points are related to restrictions on soliciting customers or partners.\n\nThere is no explicit non-solicitation or non-compete clause in the provided context that would restrict a party from contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty during or after the contract. However, it's possible that such a clause may exist in a different part of the agreement not included in the provided context.",
