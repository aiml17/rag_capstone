      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking about the renewal term of the Distributor Agreement after the initial term expires. The question specifically mentions automatic extensions and unilateral extensions with prior notice.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context for any information about the term duration and renewal. The context is a legal document, so I should check the sections related to the duration of the agreement.\n\nLooking at the conditions listed, point 10 says: \"This Agreement shall be in effect until March 18, 2021, unless sooner terminated by either party upon (30) days written notice, without cause.\" That's the initial term. The agreement is valid until March 18, 2021, but either party can terminate it 30 days before that date by giving notice. \n\nNow, the user is asking about the renewal term. The key part here is whether there's any mention of automatic renewal or how the agreement is extended beyond the initial term. The context doesn't mention anything about automatic renewal. The only information provided is about termination. The agreement lasts until March 18, 2021, and if neither party terminates it 30 days before that date, it would presumably end on that date. There's no indication that the agreement renews automatically for another term. The termination clause allows for ending it with 30 days notice, but there's no mention of a renewal process or automatic extension beyond the initial term. \n\nSo, based on the given information, the initial term is until March 18, 2021, and there's no automatic renewal. The agreement doesn't specify any unilateral extensions beyond the initial term unless both parties agree to a new term, which isn't mentioned here. The answer should state that there's no automatic renewal and that the agreement doesn't provide for unilateral extensions beyond the initial term as per the given context.\n</think>\n\nThe Distributor Agreement does not specify a renewal term or automatic extension beyond the initial term. The agreement is explicitly stated to be in effect until **March 18, 2021**, unless terminated earlier by either party with **30 days' written notice** (Condition 10). There is no mention of automatic renewal, unilateral extensions, or provisions for extending the term beyond this expiration date. The termination clause allows either party to end the agreement without cause by providing 30 days' notice,",

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if there's an exclusive dealing commitment in the provided context. The context is an amendment to a co-branding agreement between PC Quote, Inc. (PCQ) and A.B. Watley, Inc. (ABW). The amendment is about Section 2, Part B, which is titled \"Term.\" The document mentions that this amendment applies to PCQ and ABW and their subsidiaries and related companies. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what an exclusive dealing commitment entails. It usually means that one party agrees to buy all their needs from the other party, or not to deal with others. It could also involve prohibitions on selling to third parties or collaborating with others.\n\nLooking at the provided text, the main part is the amendment to the Term section. The Term section typically outlines the duration of the agreement. The amendment is effective December 9, 1996, and the parties are PCQ and ABW. The document includes signatures from both companies with dates: Steven Malin from ABW on 12/5/96 and Howard Meltzer from PCQ on 12/12/96. \n\nThe key here is that the context provided doesn't include the actual content of the amendment. The user provided a snippet that's just the title, the parties involved, and the signatures. There's a [LOGO] and [***], which might indicate that parts of the document are redacted or missing. The source is from an S-1/A filing, which is a registration statement for a securities offering, so sometimes these filings redact certain information.\n\nSince the user is asking about an exclusive dealing commitment, but the provided context doesn't have the actual terms of the amendment, there's no mention of exclusivity, requirements to procure all goods/services from one party, prohibitions on licensing to others, etc. The only information given is about the amendment's effective date, the parties, and the signatories. \n\nTherefore, based solely on the provided context, there's no indication of an exclusive dealing commitment.

(or its subsidiary licensing the software) and the \"Customer\" who is the business entity binding itself to the agreement. The agreement does not mention any third-party beneficiaries who would have rights under the contract.\n\nThe only parties mentioned are Cisco, the Customer, and potentially Government end users who are granted a limited set of rights under the \"Government End User Purchasers\" clause. However, this clause does not appear to confer any enforceable rights to the Government end users beyond the rights already granted to the Customer.\n\nTherefore, the Software License Agreement appears to be solely between Cisco and the contracting Customer, and does not create any rights or ability to enforce the contract for any non-contracting third parties.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if there's a non-contracting party who is a beneficiary to some or all of the clauses in this Cisco Software License Agreement. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what a non-contracting party means. A non-contracting party is someone who isn't a signatory to the contract but might still have rights under it if the contract is structured in a way that benefits them. Typically, contracts only bind the parties who are part of them, but sometimes there are clauses that make third parties beneficiaries.\n\nLooking at the provided context, the Software License Agreement is between Cisco and the Customer. The Customer is the business entity represented by the person downloading or installing the software. The agreement outlines the terms under which the Customer can use Cisco's software. \n\nNow, I need to check if any part of the agreement mentions third-party beneficiaries. Let me scan through the sections again. \n\nIn the \"License\" section, it says the license is granted to the Customer for their internal business purposes. There's a mention of using the software on Cisco equipment owned or leased by the Customer. \n\nIn the \"General Limitations\" section, there's a point about not using the software to perform services for third parties without Cisco's authorization. But that seems to restrict the Customer from using the software for third parties, not granting rights to third parties.\n\nThe \"Export\" section requires the Customer to comply with export laws, but again, that's obligations on the Customer, not third-party rights.\n\nLooking at the \"Government End User Purchasers\" section, it mentions that if the Customer is a government entity, certain rights apply. However, this still refers to the Customer as the direct party. \n\nThe \"Disclaimer of Liabilities\" and \"General Terms\" sections don't mention third-party beneficiaries. The agreement seems to be between Cisco and the Customer, with the Customer being the original end user. \n\nThere's a part about audits where Cisco can examine the Customer's records to verify compliance. But again, that's about enforcing terms against the Customer, not third parties.\n\nI don't see any explicit clause that designates a third party as a beneficiary. The agreement is structured so that the Customer is the one with rights and obligations. Even when mentioning third parties, like in the restriction on using software for third-party services, it's about prohibitions rather than granting rights.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided text, there's no indication that a",

Customer agrees that aspects of the Software and associated Documentation, including the specific design and structure of individual programs, are trade secrets and/or copyrighted materials of Cisco, its suppliers or licensors. Customer shall not disclose, provide, or otherwise make available such trade secrets or copyrighted material in any form to any third party without the prior written consent of Cisco.

Customer may terminate this Agreement and the license at any time by destroying all copies of Software including any Documentation. Customer's rights under this Agreement will terminate immediately without notice from Cisco if Customer fails to comply with any provision of this Agreement. Upon termination, Customer shall destroy all copies of Software and Documentation in its possession or control.\n\nCustomer Records. Customer grants to Cisco and its independent accountants the right to examine Customer's books, records and accounts during Customer's normal business hours to verify compliance with this Agreement. In the event such audit discloses non-compliance with this Agreement, Customer shall promptly pay to Cisco the appropriate license fees.\n\nExport.

Customer's sole and exclusive remedy and the entire liability of Cisco and its suppliers and licensors under this limited warranty will be, at Cisco's option, repair, replacement,\n\nSource: SCANSOURCE, INC., 10-K, 8/22/2019\n\n\n\n\n\nExhibit 10.38\n\nor refund of the Software if reported (or, upon request, returned) to Cisco or the party supplying the Software to Customer, if different than Cisco. In no event does Cisco warrant that the Software is error free or that Customer will be able to operate the Software without problems or interruptions. In addition, due to the continual development of new techniques for intruding upon and attacking networks, Cisco does not warrant that the Software or any equipment, system or network on which the Software is used will be free of vulnerability to intrusion or attack.\n\nRestrictions.

TO THE EXTENT AN IMPLIED WARRANTY CANNOT BE EXCLUDED, SUCH WARRANTY IS LIMITED IN DURATION TO THE WARRANTY PERIOD. BECAUSE SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY. THIS WARRANTY GIVES CUSTOMER SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS, AND CUSTOMER MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER RIGHTS WHICH VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION. This disclaimer and exclusion shall apply even if the express warranty set forth above fails of its essential purpose.\n\nGeneral Terms Applicable to the Limited Warranty Statement and Software License\n\nDisclaimer of Liabilities. IN NO EVENT WILL CISCO OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, PROFIT, OR LOST OR DAMAGED DATA, OR FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES HOWEVER CAUSED AND REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY OR WHETHER ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE SOFTWARE OR OTHERWISE AND EVEN IF CISCO OR ITS SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. In no event shall Cisco's or its suppliers' or licensors' liability to Customer, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, exceed the price paid by Customer for the Software that gave rise to the claim or if the Software is part of another Product, the price paid for such other Product. The foregoing limitations shall apply even if the above\u200b stated warranty fails of its essential purpose.

      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the context provided in the document, there is no explicit mention of a right for either party to audit the books, records, or physical locations of the counterparty to ensure compliance with the contract.\n\nThe document outlines various amendments to the Supply and Manufacturing Agreement between Cerus Corporation and Porex Corporation, but does not contain any provisions granting audit rights to either party. The agreement is focused on pricing, delivery, and other operational terms related to the manufacturing of certain components, but does not address audit rights.\n\nWithout any specific language in the agreement regarding audit rights, there does not appear to be a contractual right for either Cerus or Porex to audit the other party's books, records, or facilities to verify compliance. The agreement is silent on this matter, so there is no indication that such an audit right has been granted to either party.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether either party has the right to audit the other's books, records, or physical locations to ensure compliance with the contract. I need to check the provided context for any mention of audit rights.\n\nFirst, I'll start by skimming through the sections of the First Amendment to the Supply and Manufacturing Agreement. The main sections are the recitals, then the amendments. The amendments include adding new exhibits, modifying pricing, changing section 1.3 regarding capacity limits, adding new sections 1.5.3, 3a, and others. \n\nLooking at Section 1.5.3, it's about invoicing and payment terms. It mentions how Porex will invoice Cerus monthly, payment terms, acceptance of services, and handling of disputes. There's nothing about audits here.\n\nNext, Section 3a talks about Non-Production Related Work, including work orders and statements of work. It outlines how work orders become statements of work, payment terms for those, and that Cerus consents to Porex using dedicated space and equipment. Still no mention of audit rights.\n\nI'll check the rest of the amendments. The other sections add new exhibits and modify existing ones. The recitals mention changes to cost structures and pricing. The rest of the sections don't seem to address audit rights. \n\nSince the original question is about audit rights, and the provided context is an amendment to the agreement, it's possible that the audit rights might be in the original Agreement (the one dated April 1, 2017) but not mentioned in this amendment. However, the user hasn't provided the original Agreement's text. The amendment only modifies certain parts, and the answer must be based solely on the provided context.\n\nIn the provided context, there's no mention of audit rights. The closest thing might be in Section 1.5.3 where Cerus can reject services if there are issues, but that's about service acceptance, not auditing. Also, there's a part about disputed invoices and resolving billing queries, but again, not about auditing books or physical locations.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, the answer would be that the context does not provide evidence that either party has the right to audit the other's books, records, or physical locations. The contract amendments don't include audit rights, so the answer would be no unless there's something in the original agreement, which isn",

        "[*] = CERTAIN CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS DOCUMENT, MARKED BY BRACKETS, HAS BEEN OMITTED AND FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION PURSUANT TO RULE 24B-2 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED. EXHIBIT 10.2 FIRST AMENDMENT TO SUPPLY AND MANUFACTURING AGREEMENT This First Amendment (\"Amendment\") to the Supply and Manufacturing Agreement dated April 1, 2017 between Cerus Corporation (\"Cerus\") and Porex Corporation (\"Porex\") (the \"Agreement\") is made this 22 day of June 2018. RECITALS A. Cerus and Porex have agreed to make certain changes to the raw material and process to develop Components and such changes have resulted in a change to the cost and expense structure originally contemplated by the Agreement; B. Pursuant to Section 3 of the Agreement, Cerus and Porex have mutually agreed to temporarily modify the pricing for Platelet Wafers set forth on Exhibit D and to proactively set a cost structure for non-production related work. NOW THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged and accepted, the parties hereby agree to amend the Agreement as follows: 1. New Exhibits AA-1, AA-2, AA-3 and AA-4, as set forth in Schedule 1 to this Amendment, shall be attached to the Agreement (inserted between Exhibit A-5 and Exhibit B-1) and incorporated therein by reference. The parties acknowledge and agree that Exhibits AA-1, AA-2, AA-3 and AA-4 set forth the revised specifications for Platelet Wafers manufactured by Porex for Cerus (collectively, the \"Revised Wafer Specifications\"). Unless otherwise agreed in writing, Porex shall continue to manufacture and produce Platelet Wafers using the existing specifications for Platelet Wafers until Cerus gives written notice to Porex that Platelet Wafers shall be thereafter manufactured in accordance with the Revised Wafer Specifications. References in the Agreement to \"Specifications\" shall be interpreted to include the Revised Wafer Specifications, as applicable. 2. A new Exhibit D-1, as set forth in Schedule 2 to this Amendment, shall be attached to the Agreement and incorporated therein by reference. As of April 1, 2018 and continuing until Cerus determines, in its sole discretion, that the Protocol EPP-029-886 under which Porex is currently operating can be discontinued, the price for Platelet Wafers shall be the prices set forth in Exhibit D-1. Upon Cerus' determination that the Protocol EPP-029- 886 can be discontinued, Cerus shall provide written notice thereof to Porex, along with a new purchase order for Platelet Wafers (the \"New Pricing PO\"). On and after the date of such notice, the \"Pricing\" table for Platelet Wafers in Exhibit D, as of the date immediately preceding the date of this Amendment, shall be reinstated and apply to Platelet Wafers that are produced pursuant to the New Pricing PO and were also produced after the date of the written notice. References in Section 1.5.1 of the Agreement to \"Exhibit D\" shall be amended to include \"Exhibit D-1,\" as applicable. 3. The penultimate sentence in Section 1.3 shall be deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following: \"In no event shall any Purchase Order: require delivery of more than [*] units of [*] and [*] units of [*] in any [*] (the \"Porex Capacity Limitations\").\" 4. A new Section 1.5.3 shall be added to the Agreement as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n1.5.3 Porex will invoice Cerus monthly for Services performed by Porex during the prior month. Unless otherwise expressly provided in the applicable Statement of Work payment to Porex of undisputed fees shall be due [*] days following Cerus' receipt of the invoice submitted by Porex. Payment information, including Tax Identification Number will be included on each invoice.\n\nCerus shall have the right to accept or reject the Services, or any portion thereof, in writing within [*] days from Porex's completion of the Services. Such acceptance or rejection shall be consistent with the criteria set forth in the Statement of Work, if any. If Cerus does not reject in writing within [*] days, the Services shall be considered accepted by Cerus. Within [*] days of any notice of rejection, Porex shall present a corrective plan of action to Cerus. Upon approval by Cerus of the corrective plan, Porex, at no additional expense to Cerus, shall then make the corrections and, where applicable, Porex shall resubmit the corrected Services to Cerus. For disputed invoices or the disputed portion of an invoice, Cerus shall use reasonable efforts to provide to Porex, in writing, within [*] days, a description of the disputed amounts. Cerus and Porex shall negotiate in a timely, good faith manner to resolve billing queries. Cerus will not have responsibility to pay for identified errors, incomplete or inaccurate items (collectively the \"invoice errors\") which result in increases to previously invoiced amounts if the aforementioned invoice errors are communicated to Cerus later than [*] days from the original invoice date.\n\n5. A new Section 3a shall be added to the Agreement as follows: \"3a Non-Production Related Work. From time to time, Cerus may submit to Porex written work orders substantially in the form of Schedule 3 that specify development activities, engineering analysis, part, material and/or fixture design and development, or other services or activities that Cerus requests Porex to perform that are not activities or services that are necessary for the then-current manufacture and production of Components for Cerus under the Agreement (collectively, as defined in each work order, the \"Services\"). Each work order shall set forth the terms and conditions (including specifications (if applicable), delivery and performance schedules, and fees) pursuant to which Porex will perform the Services. Upon acceptance of a work order by Porex (in writing), such work order shall become a \"Statement of Work.\" If Porex begins to perform services under a work order that has not been formally agreed in writing, then Porex shall bear the costs of any expenses incurred prior to formal written agreement of the Statement of Work. Cerus hereby consents to Porex's use of the Cerus Dedicated Space and Equipment, as specified in a Statement of Work, solely as necessary to perform the Services under that Statement of Work. Such consent shall automatically terminate upon the completion of the applicable Statement of Work and is limited by the terms of the Agreement. In the event of any conflict between the Agreement and a Statement of Work, the Agreement shall control unless the Statement of Work expressly refers to the Parties' intent to alter the terms of the Agreement with respect to that Statement of Work and shall not be construed as an amendment to the terms of the Agreement.\" 6. A new section titled \"Pricing for Non-Production Related Work Orders from Cerus\" is added to Exhibit D as set forth in Schedule 2 attached. Such pricing, upon mutual agreement of the Parties, shall apply to any Statement of Work mutually agreed by the Parties pursuant to Section 3a. 7. No other changes are made to the Agreement, including without limitation, the original Exhibit D, and the Agreement, the Plasma Disk pricing and related information as set forth in Exhibit D remain the same. Except as amended herein, the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the same meanings as set forth in the Agreement.

      "question": "Does the contract include a cap on liability upon the breach of a party\u2019s obligation? This includes time limitation for the counterparty to bring claims or maximum amount for recovery.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, the contract includes provisions that limit the liability of the parties upon a breach of the agreement:\n\n1. Section 14 states: \"It is agreed that no personal liability whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed on or otherwise be incurred by any Partner, agent, management official or employee of the Transporter or any director, officer or employee of any of the foregoing, for any obligation of the Transporter arising under this Agreement or for any claim based on such obligation and that the sole recourse of Shipper under this Agreement is limited to assets of the Transporter.\"\n\nThis provision limits the liability to only the assets of the Transporter, and explicitly states that no personal liability shall be attached to the Transporter's partners, agents, or employees.\n\n2. The contract does not appear to include any time limitations for the counterparty to bring claims or a maximum amount for recovery. The contract states that \"any controversy between the parties arising under this Agreement and not resolved by the parties shall be determined in accordance with the laws of the State of Michigan\", but does not specify any statute of limitations or damage caps.\n\nSo in summary, the contract includes a limitation of liability provision that restricts the recourse of the Shipper to only the assets of the Transporter, but does not appear to include any time limitations or maximum recovery amounts.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the contract includes a cap on liability when a party breaches their obligations. They also want to know if there's a time limit for the other party to bring claims or a maximum amount for recovery.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context for any mentions of liability caps, time limits for claims, or maximum recovery amounts. Let me start by skimming through the sections of the Transportation Service Agreement.\n\nLooking at the main sections, section 14 is titled \"OTHER PROVISIONS.\" There's a part that says, \"It is agreed that no personal liability whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed on or otherwise be incurred by any Partner, agent, management official or employee of the Transporter or any director, officer or employee of any of the foregoing, for any obligation of the Transporter arising under this Agreement or for any claim based on such obligation and that the sole recourse of Shipper under this Agreement is limited to assets of the Transporter.\" \n\nThis seems to indicate that the liability is capped in a way, as it limits the Shipper's recourse to the Transporter's assets and protects individuals from personal liability. However, the question is about a cap on liability in case of breach. This section mentions that the Shipper's recourse is limited to the Transporter's assets, which could be a form of liability cap, but it doesn't specify a monetary amount. \n\nNext, looking at section 13, \"MISCELLANEOUS,\" there's a mention of waiver of defaults but nothing about liability caps. Section 15 is about notices and communications. \n\nIn Appendix A, there's detailed info about the maximum daily quantity and points of receipt and delivery, but nothing about liability. \n\nThe question also asks about time limitations for bringing claims. I need to check if there's a statute of limitations or a specific time frame mentioned. The main agreement doesn't have a section that explicitly states a time limit for claims. However, the term of the contract is from November 1, 2014, to October 31, 2017. But that's the contract term, not necessarily the time to bring claims after a breach. \n\nLooking again at section 14, the part about obligations after termination says that obligations prior to termination remain in effect. But again, no mention of time limits for claims. \n\nThe \"MISCELLAN",

The user is asking if there's any clause in the provided contract that mentions joint or shared ownership of intellectual property between the parties. \n\nFirst, I need to go through the document carefully. The contract is called the Endorsement Agreement between Movado Group, Inc. and the Grinberg Family Trust. It's about a life insurance policy and the transfer of ownership related to that policy. \n\nLooking at the sections, the main points are about transferring the policy, repayment of a loan, ownership, and terms of the agreement. Let me check each section for any mention of intellectual property.\n\nSection 1: Transfer of Policy and partial repayment. No mention of IP here.\n\nSection 2: Ownership of Policy. It states the Company is the sole and exclusive owner of the Policy. So, ownership is exclusive here.\n\nSection 3: Talks about surrender, withdrawals, loans. Doesn't mention IP.\n\nSection 4: Investment of Cash Values. The Company chooses investment funds. Still no IP.\n\nSection 5: Payment of Premiums. The Company pays premiums. Not relevant.\n\nSection 6: Payment of Death Benefits. Distribution of benefits. No IP.\n\nSection 7: Company Default. Consequences if the company fails. Not related.\n\nSection 8: Notice. Addresses for communication. No IP.\n\nSection 9: Entire Agreement. States this is the complete agreement. Doesn't mention IP.\n\nSection 10: Amendments. Requires consent for adverse changes. Not IP.\n\nSection 11: Termination. Conditions for ending the agreement. No IP.\n\nSection 12: Governing Law. New York law applies. Not IP.\n\nSection 13: Administration under ERISA. Talks about administration if subject to ERISA. No IP.\n\nSection 14: Claims Procedures. How to handle disputes. Not IP.\n\nSection 15: Successors. Binding on successors. Not IP.\n\nSection 16: Gender. Pronouns. Not relevant.\n\nSection 17: No Contract of Employment. Clarifies this isn't an employment contract. Not IP.\n\nSection 18: Counterparts. Execution of the agreement. Not IP.\n\nLooking through all sections, there's no mention of intellectual property ownership, joint or shared. The only ownership discussed is the ownership of the life insurance policy by the Company. The Trust transfers ownership of the policy to the Company as part of the agreement. There's no clause that",

(the \"Company\") and the Trustees of the Grinberg Family Trust (the \"Trust\") entered into a Policy Collateral Assignment And Split Dollar Agreement, dated as of December 5, 1995 (the \"Split Dollar Agreement\"); and\n\n            WHEREAS, pursuant to the Split Dollar Agreement, life insurance protection is provided to the beneficiaries of the Trust, upon the of the death of the survivor of Gedalio Grinberg (\"Executive\") and Sonia Grinberg (Executive and Sonia Grinberg are collectively referred to as the \"Insureds\") under a life insurance policy issued to the Trust by the New York Life Insurance Company, Policy No. 45660373 (hereinafter referred to as the \"Policy\"); and\n\n            WHEREAS, pursuant to the Split Dollar Agreement, the Policy is owned by the Trust and collaterally assigned by it to the Company in order to secure the repayment of the amounts due to the Company in respect of the Company's loans to the Trust which have been used by the Trust to pay the premiums on the Policy (such loans totaling $5,186,860 on the date hereof and being represented by a Demand Note, dated December 5, 1995, between the Company and the Trust (the \"Demand Note\")); and\n\n            WHEREAS, Section XIII of the Split Dollar Agreement provides that it may be amended at any time and from time to time by a written instrument by the parties thereto; and\n\n            WHEREAS, Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of the 2002 (the \"Act\") prohibits certain public companies (including the Company) from directly or indirectly making or arranging for an extension of credit in the form of a personal loan to its executive officers on or after July 30, 2002; and\n\n            WHEREAS, Executive and a Trustee and a beneficiary of the Trust are executive officers of the Company; and\n\n            WHEREAS, counsel to the Company has advised the Company that the collateral assignment split-dollar life insurance arrangement reflected in the Split Dollar Agreement may violate the aforementioned prohibition on personal loans to executive officers set forth in Section 402 of the Act, in respect of loans made to the Trust on or after July 30, 2002, although there exists no authority on point and reasonable arguments may be made to the contrary; and\n\n            WHEREAS, in order to best ensure that the Company does not violate the aforementioned prohibition on personal loans to executive officers set forth in Section 402 of the Act, the parties hereto wish to (i) amend and restate the Split Dollar Agreement, (ii) rename the amended and restated Split Dollar Agreement the \"Movado Group, Inc.

Transfer of Policy; Partial Repayment of Demand Note. The Trustees of the Trust hereby agree to promptly execute any and all documents required by the New York Life Insurance Company (the \"Insurer\") and the Company to transfer ownership of the Policy from the Trust to the Company in exchange for the Company's agreement to promptly execute any and all documents required to reflect the partial repayment of the outstanding principal balance of the Demand Note, as described in the recitals above.\n\n            2. Ownership of Policy. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Company shall be the sole and exclusive owner of the Policy.\n\n            3. Surrender, Withdrawals, Loans; Etc. Other than as specifically allowed herein, the Company shall not borrow from, hypothecate, withdraw cash value from, surrender in whole or in part, cancel, or in any other manner encumber the Policy without the prior written consent of the Trustees of the Trust. Unless the Company and the Trustees of the Trust otherwise agree, in the event there is a complete or partial surrender or cancellation of the Policy, the proceeds payable as a result of the surrender, cancellation, withdrawal or loan shall be paid to the Company in an amount equal to the aggregate premiums paid under the Policy since inception, and any remaining proceeds shall be payable to the Trust.\n\n            4. Investment of Cash Values. If the Policy provides the policy owner with a choice of investment funds for the Policy cash values, the Company shall select the funds in which to invest such cash values.\n\n            5. Payment of Premiums. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Company agrees to pay premiums on the Policy as provided under the Policy. In\n\n\n\n\n\nthe event this Agreement is terminated in accordance with terms of Section 11, the Company shall not be liable for any premiums owed on the Policy after the date of termination.\n\n            6. Payment of Death Benefits.

(If the Policy provides for a death benefit equal to the sum of the face amount of the Policy and any cash account or accumulation value, the Company Death Benefit shall first be paid from the cash account or accumulation value portion of the death benefit.)\n\n                                                                               3\n\n                  (b) The Trust shall be entitled to receive the excess, if any, of the Policy's death benefit over the Company Death Benefit.\n\n                  (c) If any interest is payable under the Policy in respect of the death benefit for the period from the date of death of such survivor until the payment of the death benefit, the Company and the Trust shall share in such interest in proportion that their respective share of such death benefit (as determined under Section 6(a) and (b) hereof) bears to the total death benefit, excluding any interest thereon.\n\n            7. Company Default. In the event of a \"Company Default\" (as defined below), the Trust shall have the right to require the Company to cure the Company Default by notifying the Company in writing within sixty (60) days after its receipt of notice of a Company Default, or if later, within thirty (30) days after a Trustee becomes aware of the Company Default. If the Company fails to cure the Company Default within sixty (60) days after being notified by the Trust of the Company Default, the Trust shall have the right to require the Company to transfer its interest in the Policy to the Trust. The Trust may exercise this right by notifying the Company, in writing, within sixty (60) days after the Company Default occurs. Upon receipt of such notice, the Company shall immediately transfer ownership of the Policy to the Trust and the Company shall thereafter have no rights with respect to the Policy. The Trust's failure to exercise its rights under this Section 7 shall not be deemed to release the Company from any of its obligations under this Agreement, and shall not preclude the Trust from seeking other remedies with respect to the Company Default. For purposes of this Agreement, a \"Company Default\" shall be deemed to have occurred with respect to the Policy if the Company fails to pay a premium on the Policy as required under the terms of this Agreement within sixty (60) days after the due date for such premium, or if the Company processes or attempts to process a policy loan, or a complete or partial surrender, or a cash value withdrawal without prior written approval from the Trustees of the Trust.

This Agreement is the entire agreement between the Company and the Trust with respect to the subject matter hereof and contains all of the agreements, whether written, oral, express or implied, between the Company and the Trust and supersedes any other agreement by and between the Company and the Trust except to the extent specifically set forth herein.\n\n            10. Amendment.

The Plan Administrator shall have the authority to make, amend, interpret, and enforce all rules and regulations for the administration of this Agreement and decide or resolve any and all questions, including interpretations of the Agreement, as may arise in connection with this Agreement. In the administration of this Agreement, the Plan Administrator from time to time may employ agents and delegate to them or to others (including executives of the Company) such administrative duties as it sees fit. The Plan Administrator from time to time may consult with counsel, who may be counsel to the Company. The decision or action of the Plan Administrator (or its designee) with respect to any question arising out of or in connection with the administration, interpretation and application of this Agreement shall be final and conclusive and binding upon all persons having any interest in this Agreement. The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless the Plan Administrator and any Company employee to whom administrative duties under this Agreement are delegated, against any and all claims, loss, damage, expense or liability arising from any action or failure to act with respect to this Agreement, except in the case of gross negligence or willful misconduct by the Plan Administrator or any such employee.\n\n            14.

Pertinent provisions of the Agreement shall be cited and, where appropriate, an explanation as to how the claimant can perfect the claim will be provided.

I need to check the provided context for any mention of such requirements.\n\nLooking through the sections of the Hosting Agreement. Section 1 is about the agreement itself. Section 2 talks about the provision of services, including customer support. Section 3 outlines the customer's responsibilities, like maintaining their own internet access.

During the term of this Agreement, Customer may obtain information (\"Reports\") regarding Customer's use of the Software and the quantity and handling of Online Messages routed to the eGain System by accessing the eGain System through a password-protected Web site made available by eGain. Customer shall be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of such passwords and shall permit only authorized employees of Customer to access the eGain System.

Customer's Responsibilities. Customer agrees that it shall be responsible for providing and maintaining its own Internet access and all necessary telecommunications equipment, software and other materials (\"Customer Equipment\") at Customer's location necessary for accessing the Software and the eGain System through the Internet. Customer agrees to notify eGain of any changes in the Customer Equipment, including any system configuration changes or any hardware or software upgrades, which may affect the Hosting Services provided hereunder. The eGain System is only to be used for lawful purposes. Customer agrees not to transmit, re-transmit or store materials on or through the eGain System or the Software that are harmful to the eGain System or Software, or in violation of any applicable laws or regulations, including without limitation laws relating to infringement of intellectual property and proprietary rights of others. To the extent that certain components of the Software may be downloaded to Customer's or User's computer as a result of accessing the Software as part of the Hosting Services, eGain grants Customers a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license, with right to sublicense solely to Users, to use such Software only in connection with the Hosting Services. Neither Customer nor Users are otherwise permitted to use the Software, nor will Customer or Users disassemble, decompile or otherwise attempt to discern the source code of such Software. Customer agrees that, except as expressly set forth in this Section and in Section 11, it will not rent, lease, sublicense, re-sell, time-share or otherwise assign to any third party this Agreement or any of Customer's rights or licenses to access the Software or the eGain System, nor shall Customer use, or authorize others to use, the Software, Hosting Services or the eGain System to operate a service bureau. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, Customer shall be permitted to provide access to the eGain System to its employees and agents located worldwide.\n\n4. Proprietary Rights. Except for the limited access right granted to Customer in this Agreement, all right, title and interest in and to the Software (including any and all modifications as a result of any implementation services rendered) and the eGain System are and shall remain the exclusive property of eGain and its licensors. eGain acknowledges and agrees that the Online Messages are the property of Customer and that eGain has only a limited right to use the Online Messages as set forth in the following sentence. Notwithstanding the foregoing, eGain may access and disclose the Online Messages solely as necessary to provide the Hosting Services, to operate and maintain its systems, to comply with applicable laws and government orders and requests, and to protect itself and its customers.\n\n5. Pricing and Payment. Customer agrees to pay the fees and other charges for the Hosting Services and other services provided under this Agreement as specified in Exhibit A of this Agreement. CUSTOMER AGREES TO PAY FOR HOSTING SERVICES ON OR BEFORE THE FIRST DAY OF THE MONTH IN WHICH THE HOSTING SERVICES ARE PROVIDED, except that, with respect to Additional Fees (as defined in Exhibit A), eGain will invoice Customer for such Fees in the month after the month in which such fees accrue as provided in Exhibit A. All amounts payable hereunder are exclusive of any and all taxes, and Customer is responsible for payment of such taxes (excluding taxes based on eGain's net income). All prices are stated, and Customer shall pay, in United States dollars. Payment received by eGain after the due date shall be subject to a late fee equal to one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month, or, if less, the maximum amount allowed by applicable law. At the end of the initial one-year term of this Agreement and any subsequent one-year terms, eGain may adjust the monthly fee payable under this Agreement by providing Customer written notice of such adjustment at least sixty (60) days prior to the beginning of the new term.\n\n6. Limited Warranties; Disclaimer of Warranties.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1 eGain warrants and represents to Customer that (i) the Software will perform substantially in accordance with the documentation, if any, provided by eGain to Customer, and (ii) the Hosting Services will be performed in a professional and workmanlike manner and in accordance with Section 2. In the event of Downtime (as defined in this Section 6.1 below), as Customer's sole and exclusive remedy and eGain's sole and exclusive liability, the monthly fee payable for the Hosting Services shall be reduced as follows:\n\na) For the first sixty (60) minutes of Downtime during Normal Business       Hours or the first four (4) hours of Downtime outside of Normal Business       Hours (\"Initial Downtime\"), eGain will credit Customer's account for one       (1) day of service.\n\nb) For each eight (8) hour period of Downtime per day in addition to the       Initial Downtime, eGain will credit Customer's account for one (1)       additional day of service.\n\nFor the purposes of this Agreement, \"Downtime\" shall mean any interruption in the availability of Hosting Services to Customer (excluding scheduled interruptions of which Customer is notified 48 hours in advanced), only if such interruption is due either to: 1) an error in the Software, or 2) failure of the eGain System (but not including problems associated with Internet connectivity). Downtime begins upon Customer notification to eGain of the interruption, either\n\neGAIN COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION\n\nHOSTING AGREEMENT\n\nby speaking directly with an eGain customer service representative or recording a voice mail message in the eGain customer service voice mail box, and continues until the availability of the Hosting Services is restored to the Customer. For purposes of this Agreement, \"Normal Business Hours\" shall mean between the hours of 6:00 a.m to 6:00 p.m. Pacific time, Monday through Friday excluding national holidays.\n\nIn the event of a breach (other than Downtime) of the warranty set forth in Section 6.1(i) above, Customer's sole and exclusive remedy, and eGain's sole and exclusive liability shall be, at eGain's option, repair or replacement of the Software.\n\nTHE FOREGOING CONSTITUTES CUSTOMER'S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY, AND eGAIN'S ENTIRE LIABILITY, FOR DOWNTIME AND FOR BREACH OF THE HOSTING SERVICES WARRANTY PROVIDED IN THIS SECTION 6.1.\n\n6.2 eGain represents and warrants that, prior to, during and after the calendar year 2000 A.D., the Software and the eGain System will process, calculate, manipulate, sort, store and transfer date data without material error or material performance degradation, including without limitation date data which represents or references different centuries or more than one century (such representation and warranty being referred to as \"Year 2000 Compliant\"). In the event that the Software or eGain System is not Year 2000 Compliant, Customer's sole and exclusive remedy and eGain's sole and exclusive liability shall be for eGain, at no additional cost to Customer, to promptly modify the Software or the eGain System so that the Software or eGain System is Year 2000 Compliant. The foregoing warranty is conditioned upon the Customer using the Software and/or the eGain System in accordance with its applicable Documentation, and on other software, hardware, network and systems (other than the Software and the eGain System) with which the Software and/or the eGain System interface or interoperate also being Year 2000 Compliant.\n\n6.3 EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SECTIONS 6.1-6.2, (A) THE HOSTING SERVICES ARE PROVIDED, AND THE SOFTWARE AND THE eGAIN SYSTEM ARE MADE AVAILABLE, BY eGAIN TO CUSTOMER \"AS IS,\" AND (B) eGAIN AND ITS SUPPLIERS MAKE NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, REGARDING THE HOSTING SERVICES, THE SOFTWARE OR THE eGAIN SYSTEM, AND SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND AGAINST INFRINGEMENT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT POSSIBLE BY LAW.\n\n6.4 Without limiting the express warranties set forth in this Agreement, eGain does not warrant that the Software, the eGain System or the Hosting Services will meet Customer's requirements (except as provided in Section 6.1) or that Customer's access to and use of the Software, the eGain System or the Hosting Services will be uninterrupted or free of errors or omissions. eGain cannot and does not guarantee the privacy, security, authenticity and non-corruption of any information transmitted through, or stored in any system connected to, the Internet. eGain will use commercially reasonable efforts to adequately maintain, and upgrade as necessary, the eGain System to provide the Hosting Services to its customers. However, except as expressly set forth herein, eGain shall not be responsible for any delays, errors, failures to perform, or disruptions in the Hosting Services caused by or resulting from any act, omission or condition beyond eGain's reasonable control.\n\n7. Limitation of liability. EXCLUDING LIABILITY FOR INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS AS DISCUSSED IN SECTION 9 OF THIS AGREEMENT, IN NO EVENT SHALL eGAIN BE LIABLE TO CUSTOMER FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INDIRECT, SPECIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOST PROFITS), OR BE LIABLE TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, EVEN IF eGAIN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. eGain's entire liability under this Agreement for any damages from any cause whatsoever, regardless of form or action, whether in contract, negligence or otherwise, shall in no event exceed an amount equal to the price paid for the Services out of which the claim arose.\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Confidential Information. Each party agrees to keep confidential and to use only for purposes of performing (or as otherwise permitted under) this Agreement, any proprietary or confidential information of the other party disclosed pursuant to this Agreement which is marked as confidential or which would reasonably be considered of a confidential nature. The obligation of confidentiality shall not apply to information which is publicly available through authorized disclosure, is known by the receiving party at the time of disclosure as evidenced in writing, is rightfully obtained from a third party who has the right to disclose it, or which is required by law, government order or request to be disclosed. Upon any termination of this Agreement, each party shall return to the other party all confidential information of the other party, and all copies thereof, in the possession, custody or control of the party unless otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement.\n\n9. Indemnification. Subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 9, eGain will defend any third-party suit or action against Customer to the extent such suit or action is based on a claim that the Software or the eGain System infringes any valid United States patent, copyright, trade secret or other proprietary right, and eGain will pay those damages and costs finally awarded against Customer in any monetary settlement of such suit or action which are specifically attributable to such claim. These obligations do not include any claims to the extent they are based on use of the Software or eGain System in violation of this Agreement or in combination with any other software or hardware, or any modification to the Software or eGain System pursuant to Customer's specifications. If any portion of the Software or eGain System becomes, or in eGain's opinion is likely to become, the subject of a claim of infringement, then eGain may, at its option and expense, (a) procure for Customer the right to continue using such Software or the eGain System, or (b) replace or modify the Software or the eGain System so that it becomes non-infringing. The indemnity obligations set forth in this Section 9 are contingent upon: (i) Customer giving prompt written notice to the eGain of any such claim(s); (ii) eGain having sole control of the defense or settlement of the claim; and (iii) at eGain's request and expense, Customer cooperating in the investigation and defense of such claim(s). THE FOREGOING STATES eGAIN'S ENTIRE LIABILITY FOR INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS.\n\n10. Term and Termination.\n\n10.1 Term and Termination. This Agreement shall continue in effect from the Effective Date for a one (1) year period, unless earlier terminated as set forth below, and thereafter shall renew automatically for successive one (1) year periods unless either party gives the other party at least thirty (30) days prior written notice of its intent not to renew the Agreement. In addition, either party may terminate this Agreement by giving to the other party written notice\n\neGAIN COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION\n\nHOSTING AGREEMENT\n\nof such termination upon the other party's material breach of any material term (subject to the other party's right to cure within thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice), the other party's insolvency, or the institution of any bankruptcy or similar proceedings by or against the other party.\n\n10.2 Effect of Termination. Upon any termination of this Agreement, eGain shall immediately cease providing all Hosting Services, and Customer shall no longer have access to the Software or the eGain System. Except in the event of termination for Customer's breach, eGain shall provide Customer with an electronic copy of the final Reports (covering the month just prior to termination of this Agreement). eGain shall be entitled to retain a copy (whether electronic or otherwise) of the Online Messages and the Reports for its records and internal purposes and shall not disclose such Online Messages or Reports to any third party except as permitted under Section 4. Within fifteen (15) days of any termination of this Agreement, Customer shall pay to eGain all unpaid fees accrued prior to termination. Sections 4, 5 (as to amounts accrued but unpaid), 7, 8, 10.2 and 12 and Exhibit A (as to amounts accrued but unpaid) shall survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement.\n\n11. Customer References. Customer agrees that, during the term of this Agreement, eGain may reference Customer in eGain's customer listings and may place Customer's name and logo on eGain's Web site and in collateral marketing materials relating to eGain's products and services. Customer hereby grants eGain a right to use Customer's trademarks (name and logo only) designated by Customer for such limited uses, subject to Customer's trademark/logo usage guidelines, if any, provided by Customer to eGain. With these limited exceptions, eGain agrees that it may not use Customer's name, logo or any other trademarks (including in any press releases, customer \"case studies,\" and the like) without Customer's prior consent.\n\n12. Miscellaneous. This Agreement, including Exhibit A and any other exhibits hereto, constitutes the entire agreement of the parties, and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous agreements between the parties, with respect to the subject of this Agreement. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, this Agreement may be modified only by a writing signed by an authorized representative of each party. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California exclusive of its conflict of laws principles. Notices under this Agreement shall be in writing, addressed to the party at its last-provided address, and shall be deemed given when delivered personally, or by e-mail (with confirmation of receipt) or conventional mail (registered or certified, postage prepaid with return receipt requested). Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended or is to be construed to constitute eGain and Customer as partners or joint venturers or\n\n\n\n\n\neither party as an agent of the other. If any provision of this Agreement shall be declared invalid, illegal or unenforceable, all remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect. All waivers of any rights or breach hereunder must be in writing to be effective, and no failure to enforce any right or provision shall be deemed to be a waiver of the same or other right or provision on that or any other occasion. Neither party may assign or otherwise transfer its rights and/or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no consent shall be required for an assignment of this Agreement made pursuant to a merger, consolidation, or the acquisition of all or substantially all of the business and assets of a party. This Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties and their successors and permitted assigns.\n\nEach party agrees to the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement.\n\nCustomer: Eliance Corporation\n\nName:/s/                                 Title:                              ___________________________               _________\n\nSignature:______________________         Date:__________\n\neGain Communications Corporation:\n\nName:/s/                                 Title:                              ___________________________               _________\n\nSignature:______________________         Date:__________"

I need to check the provided context thoroughly.\n\nFirst, I'll start by skimming through the entire document. The context is an amendment to a manufacturing agreement between Stremick's Heritage Foods, LLC and Premier Nutrition Corporation. The amendment is effective from October 1, 2018, and expires on December 31, 2021. It modifies various sections of the original agreement dated July 1, 2017.\n\nLooking through the sections, the amendments cover things like the term of the agreement, basic terms, production of products, delivery, pricing, billing, payment, schedules, notices, and other schedules.

Let me go through each section mentioned:\n\n1. **Term**: Talks about the effective dates and expiration, but nothing about insurance.\n2. **Basic Terms (Section 1)**: Amendments here are about pricing schedules (Schedule C and C-1). No mention of insurance.\n3. **Production of Product (Section 2)**: Changes include adding Schedule A-1, defining \"Tetra Units,\" and modifying production terms. Still no insurance.\n4. **Deliver, Pricing, Billing and Payment (Section 3)**: Adjustments to purchasing ingredients and invoicing. No insurance here either.\n5. **Schedule A-1 and Schedule C-1**: These are attached but their contents aren't detailed in the context provided. However, the user's question is about the amendment document, so unless the schedules themselves mention insurance, which isn't indicated here, this isn't relevant.\n6. **Notices (Section 13)**: Only updates the address for Premier's contact. No insurance.\n7. **Other sections**: The rest of the amendments don't mention insurance either.\n\nThe entire document focuses on production terms, pricing schedules, product specifications, and administrative details like addresses. There's no mention of insurance requirements, indemnification, or any clauses where one party must maintain insurance for the other's benefit. \n\nSince the user is asking specifically about insurance requirements, and after reviewing all the sections of the amendment provided, there's no indication that such a requirement exists in this",
