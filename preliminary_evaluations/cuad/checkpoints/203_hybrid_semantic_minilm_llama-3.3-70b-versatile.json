      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the context provided in the Cooperation Agreement, there does not appear to be any uncapped liability for a party's breach of the contract. The agreement does not explicitly state that a party's liability is uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.\n\nThe relevant sections are:\n\n1. Clause 5 on Confidential Information, which states that the obligations of confidentiality shall remain in force until the relevant information enters the public domain otherwise than by the default of a party. This suggests there is no uncapped liability for breach of the confidentiality obligation.\n\n2. Clause 4.1 regarding QIWI's obligation to settle transactions through Otkritie's bank. This clause states that if QIWI terminates this obligation, it shall pay a fee to Otkritie, but this fee is capped at RUB 50,000,000. This indicates a cap on liability for breach of this specific obligation.\n\n3. The agreement does not contain any other provisions that suggest uncapped liability for breach of the contract or specific types of breaches. The dispute resolution clause (Clause 9) also does not indicate uncapped damages.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the Cooperation Agreement, the liability of the parties does not appear to be uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.",

In fact, the context primarily focuses on confidentiality obligations, disclosure exceptions, and other contractual terms without mentioning liability caps or specific monetary consequences for breaches, including IP infringement or breach of confidentiality obligations.
