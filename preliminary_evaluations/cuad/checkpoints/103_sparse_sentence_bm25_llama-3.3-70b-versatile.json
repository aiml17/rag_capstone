      "question": "Is a party\u2019s liability uncapped upon the breach of its obligation in the contract? This also includes uncap liability for a particular type of breach such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality obligation.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the context provided in the Cooperation Agreement, there does not appear to be any uncapped liability for a party's breach of the contract. The agreement does not explicitly state that a party's liability is uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.\n\nThe relevant sections are:\n\n1. Clause 5 on Confidential Information, which states that the obligations of confidentiality shall remain in force until the relevant information enters the public domain otherwise than by the default of a party. This suggests there is no uncapped liability for breach of the confidentiality obligation.\n\n2. Clause 4.1 regarding QIWI's obligation to settle transactions through Otkritie's bank. This clause states that if QIWI terminates this obligation, it shall pay a fee to Otkritie, but this fee is capped at RUB 50,000,000. This indicates a cap on liability for breach of this specific obligation.\n\n3. The agreement does not contain any other provisions that suggest uncapped liability for breach of the contract or specific types of breaches. The dispute resolution clause (Clause 9) also does not indicate uncapped damages.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the Cooperation Agreement, the liability of the parties does not appear to be uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.",
      "generated_response": "The provided context does not explicitly state that a party's liability is uncapped upon the breach of its obligation in the contract. However, it does outline specific circumstances and obligations, particularly regarding confidentiality (Clause 5), where the parties are expected to take reasonable steps to preserve confidentiality and mitigate the effects of disclosure.\n\nFor instance, in the event of a breach of confidentiality, the party responsible is expected to cooperate with the other party to mitigate the effects of or avoid the requirements for disclosure (Clause 5.3). Additionally, if an affiliate of a party is compelled to disclose confidential information in litigation, they may disclose the portion of the confidential information they are compelled to disclose without liability under the agreement, provided they give the other party written notice and use reasonable efforts to obtain assurances that confidential treatment will be accorded to such confidential information (Clause 5.4).\n\nWhile the contract does impose obligations and potential liabilities for breaches, including those related to confidentiality, it does not explicitly mention uncapped liability for any type of breach, including IP infringement or breach of confidentiality obligations. The specifics of liability, including whether it is capped or uncapped, would typically be found in clauses dealing with indemnification, limitation of liability, or specific breach consequences, which are not fully detailed in the provided context. Therefore, based on the information given, it cannot be conclusively determined that a party's liability is uncapped for any breach.",

Additionally, it states that the franchisee shall not employ any of the marks in signing any contract or applying for any franchise or permit, or in a manner that may result in Pretzel Time's liability for any of the franchisee's indebtedness or obligations.\n\nBut, there is a non-compete provision mentioned, which may not be enforceable under the laws of the state, implying that there could be some restrictions.

The agreement does not mention any third-party beneficiaries who would have rights under the contract.\n\nThe only parties mentioned are Cisco, the Customer, and potentially Government end users who are granted a limited set of rights under the \"Government End User Purchasers\" clause. However, this clause does not appear to confer any enforceable rights to the Government end users beyond the rights already granted to the Customer.\n\nTherefore, the Software License Agreement appears to be solely between Cisco and the contracting Customer, and does not create any rights or ability to enforce the contract for any non-contracting third parties.",

In fact, the contract explicitly states that the limited warranty extends only to the Customer who is the original licensee, and that Customer shall not disclose or make available trade secrets or copyrighted materials to any third party without Cisco's prior written consent.

      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the information provided in the Joint Venture Agreement, there does not appear to be any explicit restriction on the parties from contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty, either during the contract or after the contract ends.\n\nThe key relevant sections are:\n\n1. Duty of Loyalty (Section 44): This section states that the members can have interests in other businesses, provided they have the consent of the majority of the other members. It does not explicitly prohibit contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty.\n\n2. Confidentiality (Sections 45-46): These sections require the members to treat all matters relating to the agreement and the venture as confidential, and prohibit disclosure to third parties without prior written approval. However, this confidentiality provision is limited to a duration of one year after the expiration or termination of the agreement.\n\nThe agreement does not contain any non-compete, non-solicitation, or exclusivity clauses that would restrict the parties from contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty, either during the contract term or after it ends. The agreement appears to be focused on governing the joint venture relationship itself, rather than placing restrictions on the parties' external business activities.",
      "generated_response": "The provided context does not explicitly state that a party is restricted from contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty. However, it does mention that \"Authority to bind the Venture in contract or in any third party business relation lies exclusively with the Managers, acting jointly\" (sections 10 and 11), which implies that individual members may not have the authority to contract or solicit on behalf of the Venture without joint approval from the Managers.\n\nAdditionally, section 45 mentions that all matters relating to the Agreement and the Venture will be treated as confidential, and no Member will disclose any Venture matter to a third party without prior written approval from all Members. This suggests that there may be some restrictions on soliciting or disclosing information about the Venture's customers or partners, but it does not explicitly prohibit contracting or soliciting them.\n\nIt is also worth noting that section 46 states that the confidentiality obligations will survive for one year after the expiration or termination of the Agreement, which could be interpreted as a restriction on soliciting or disclosing information about the Venture's customers or partners after the contract ends. However, this is not a direct restriction on contracting or soliciting them.\n\nIn summary, while there are some restrictions on authority to contract and confidentiality, the context does not explicitly restrict a party from contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty, whether during the contract or after the contract ends.",
