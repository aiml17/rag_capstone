      "question": "Is a party\u2019s liability uncapped upon the breach of its obligation in the contract? This also includes uncap liability for a particular type of breach such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality obligation.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the context provided in the Cooperation Agreement, there does not appear to be any uncapped liability for a party's breach of the contract. The agreement does not explicitly state that a party's liability is uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.\n\nThe relevant sections are:\n\n1. Clause 5 on Confidential Information, which states that the obligations of confidentiality shall remain in force until the relevant information enters the public domain otherwise than by the default of a party. This suggests there is no uncapped liability for breach of the confidentiality obligation.\n\n2. Clause 4.1 regarding QIWI's obligation to settle transactions through Otkritie's bank. This clause states that if QIWI terminates this obligation, it shall pay a fee to Otkritie, but this fee is capped at RUB 50,000,000. This indicates a cap on liability for breach of this specific obligation.\n\n3. The agreement does not contain any other provisions that suggest uncapped liability for breach of the contract or specific types of breaches. The dispute resolution clause (Clause 9) also does not indicate uncapped damages.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the Cooperation Agreement, the liability of the parties does not appear to be uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether a party's liability is uncapped in case of a breach of the contract, specifically mentioning IP infringement or confidentiality breaches. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context for any clauses that mention liability caps or uncapped liability. The context includes several clauses, like 5.1 to 5.4 about confidentiality and 7.5, 7.6, and 9.1-9.2 about governing law and assignment.\n\nLooking at the confidentiality sections (5.1-5.4), they outline the obligations not to disclose confidential information and exceptions. However, there's no mention of liability limits or caps. The clauses specify what the parties can't do and under what circumstances disclosure is allowed, but they don't state whether the liability is capped or not. \n\nThen, checking other parts of the contract, like 7.5 and 7.6, which deal with assignment and third-party rights, there's still no mention of liability caps. The governing law is set as England and Wales law in 9.1. \n\nSince the question is about whether the liability is uncapped, and the contract doesn't specify any caps, the default under English law would apply. In English contract law, unless there's an explicit cap, liability for breach can be uncapped. However, sometimes contracts include exclusions or limitations of liability clauses. But in this case, the provided context doesn't include any such clauses. \n\nTherefore, based on the information given, the answer would be that the liability is uncapped because the contract doesn't specify any caps, and under English law, breaches like confidentiality or IP infringement would result in uncapped liability unless stated otherwise.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: The provided context does not explicitly state whether a party\u2019s liability is capped or uncapped upon breach of the contract, including for IP infringement or confidentiality breaches. However, under English law (as specified in Clause 9.1), contractual liability for breaches such as confidentiality violations is generally **uncapped** unless the contract includes a specific limitation or exclusion clause. Since no such limitation is mentioned in the provided clauses, the default position under English law would apply, implying **uncapped liability** for breaches of confidentiality or other obligations. The absence of a liability cap in the text suggests that parties may be liable for full damages arising from such breaches.",

      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, according to the General Provisions of the Sponsorship Agreement, the Sponsor (Rubio's Fresh Mexican Grill) must obtain and continuously maintain certain insurance policies for the benefit of the counterparty, SDBF (San Diego Ballpark Funding LLC):\n\nSpecifically, Section 8(c) states that Sponsor must obtain and continuously maintain the following insurance policies:\n\n1.

An occurrence-based Commercial General Liability Insurance Policy with minimum liability limits.\n\nThe policies must name SDBF, Padres LP, the City of San Diego, and their subsidiary/affiliated companies and directors/officers/employees as Additional Insureds. The policies must also contain Cross Liability Endorsements and a Waiver of Subrogation in favor of SDBF.\n\nSponsor must provide SDBF with certificates of insurance evidencing compliance with these insurance requirements prior to the commencement of the sponsorship and annually prior to the expiration of each required insurance policy.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if there's a requirement for insurance that one party must maintain for the benefit of the counterparty. The context provided is about insurance policies that the Sponsor must obtain and maintain.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the context. The Sponsor is required to get insurance from an admitted carrier with an A.M. (maybe that's a typo, like AM Best rating? Not sure, but maybe not crucial here). The Sponsor must maintain insurance at their own expense, including indemnity, insurance, and assumption of risk. \n\nThen there's a part about if the insurance is canceled, not renewed, or materially modified, the Sponsor has to give 30 days written notice to SDBF. Also, the Sponsor must provide certificates of insurance to SDBF before the sponsorship starts and annually before each policy expires. The specific insurance mentioned is an ISO occurrence-based Commercial General Liability Policy with certain coverage limits.\n\nSo the question is whether there's a requirement for insurance maintained by one party (the Sponsor) for the benefit of the counterparty (SDBF). The answer seems to be yes because the Sponsor is required to maintain insurance that covers liabilities, which would protect SDBF. The contractual liability and products/completed operations coverage would be for the benefit of third parties, including SDBF. Also, the notice and certificate requirements ensure that SDBF is aware of the coverage and its status. \n\nI need to make sure that the insurance is indeed for the counterparty's benefit. The mention of contractual liability suggests that the Sponsor's obligations under the contract (which SDBF is a party to) are covered, so if there's a claim against SDBF due to the Sponsor's actions, the insurance would cover it. Therefore, the requirement is in place to protect SDBF, the counterparty.\n</think>\n\nYes, there is a requirement for insurance that must be maintained by the Sponsor for the benefit of the counterparty (SDBF). The Sponsor is obligated to obtain and maintain an **Insurance Services Office (ISO) occurrence-based Commercial General Liability Insurance Policy** with specific coverage (contractual liability, products/completed operations liability) and minimum limits. This insurance protects SDBF by covering liabilities arising from the Sponsor\u2019s activities, including contractual obligations and completed operations.

So, the initial term ends on March 18, 2021, but either party can end it earlier by giving 30 days notice.\n\nThe question is about the renewal term. The context doesn't mention anything about automatic renewal. The termination clause allows for termination upon 30 days notice, but that's not a renewal.

The context doesn't specify any automatic renewal. The only termination is by either party giving 30 days notice.

The contract grants Distributor (GLS LLC) a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use and sublicense the Software provided by Airspan, but it does not explicitly grant a license or rights to any affiliates of the Distributor.\n\nSpecifically, Section 11.1 states:\n\n\"Airspan grants Distributor, and Distributor hereby accepts, a nonexclusive, non-transferable license to use, and to sublicense as set forth below, Software provided by Airspan hereunder only on a single System or unit of Equipment, as may be applicable.\"\n\nThere is no mention of affiliates of the Distributor being granted any license or rights to the Software.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the contract grants a license to the licensee and their affiliates. The user is asking about the license grant to the licensee, including any sublicensors and their affiliates.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context. The main section about the license is in 11.1. It says that Airspan grants the Distributor a nonexclusive, non-transferable license to use and sublicense the Software. The key part here is \"sublicense as set forth below,\" which probably refers to the rest of the agreement. \n\nIn 11.1, the license is given to the Distributor, and it's non-transferable. The question is about whether affiliates of the licensee (Distributor) are included. The term \"non-transferable\" might mean that the Distributor can't transfer the license to others, including affiliates. However, the Distributor can sublicense as specified. \n\nLooking at 11.2, there are restrictions on the Distributor's use. For example, they can only use the Software on Systems provided by Airspan. There's no mention of affiliates here. The license is specifically for the Distributor, and the sublicense is part of that. \n\nIn section 1.1, it mentions that the Distributor is appointed as an independent, exclusive distributor to resell Airspan Products. But again, the license for the Software is separate. The Distributor's appointment doesn't transfer any rights to the Software beyond reselling. \n\nThe term \"non-transferable\" in 11.1 suggests that the Distributor can't transfer the license to any third party, including affiliates. However, the Distributor can sublicense, but the context doesn't specify if that includes affiliates. The sublicense is part of the license granted to the Distributor, but the non-transferable clause might limit that. \n\nAlso, there's no explicit mention of affiliates in the license terms. The license is given to the Distributor, and the sublicense is under the Distributor's control. Unless the agreement allows sublicensing to affiliates, which isn't stated here, the answer would be that the license is only for the Distributor and not their affiliates. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The license is granted to the Distributor (the licensee) and allows them to sublicense as per the agreement. However, the non-transferable clause likely prevents the Distributor from transferring the license to affiliates. The contract",

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of the contract based on the provided context. The context given is about a company, an MHC (maybe a Mutual Holding Company?), and a Bank. There are sections about payment of expenses, indemnification, and some legal proceedings.\n\nLooking through the context, there's a mention of \"the Plan\" in several places. For example, in section (i), it says \"for a period of 90 days after the Closing Date...\" and in section (j) it mentions registering Common Stock \"pursuant to the Plan.\" Then in the Indemnification section under (xvii), it says \"The Plan complies in all material respects with all applicable federal laws...\" \n\nSo \"the Plan\" seems to be a key document here. The question is asking for the name of the contract. The context doesn't explicitly name the contract, but \"the Plan\" is referenced multiple times as a governing document. Since the user is asking for the name, and the context doesn't provide a specific title beyond \"the Plan,\" maybe that's the answer. However, sometimes in legal documents, \"Plan\" could refer to something like a Merger Plan, Offering Plan, or another specific type. But given the sections mentioned (like payment of expenses, registration of stock), it might be related to a stock offering or MHC conversion plan. \n\nWait, in the context, there's a mention of \"the MHC Application,\" \"Registration Statement,\" and \"Prospectus.\" Also, in (xvii) it says \"the Plan complies... including, but not limited to, the MHC Regulations.\" So maybe \"the Plan\" is the MHC Plan? Or perhaps the Offering Plan? Since the Offering is mentioned in (xvii) as being conducted according to the Plan. \n\nBut the problem is the context doesn't explicitly state the full name. The user is asking for the name of the contract. If \"the Plan\" is the contract, then maybe the answer is \"the Plan.\" However, sometimes in legal contexts, \"Plan\" could be part of a longer name. But given the information provided, the only contract name mentioned is \"the Plan.\" \n\nAlternatively, maybe the contract is called the \"Registration Statement and Prospectus,\" but those are separate documents.

The next lines talk about the governing law being New York, except for Section 25 which is Massachusetts. There's a submission to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of federal and New York state courts in New York City.

The term \"Remarketing Agreement\" is mentioned as the source for capitalized terms. Also, the last line refers to \"Agreement\" as defined in the preamble. \n\nSince the context is part of a larger document, the actual name of the contract is likely the \"Remarketing Agreement\" because that's the agreement referenced for definitions. The other parts like Indemnification and Amendment are sections within that main agreement. The preamble would typically be the beginning of the document where the contract's name is stated.

      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, based on the information provided in the agreement, there are certain obligations that continue after the termination or expiration of the contract:\n\n1. The provisions of Sections 3.6, 4, 6, 8, 9 and 11 shall survive any termination of the agreement (Section 10.8).\n\n2. Any contract entered into by the Parties with a Marketer for the Product shall survive termination of the agreement in accordance with its terms, including any renewal rights provided therein (Section 10.1). \n\n3. Upon any breach by CAPSUGEL, CARDAX shall be permitted to use all Intellectual Property of CAPSUGEL used in the Formulation and the Product to the extent necessary for the development and marketing of the Product (Section 10.2).\n\n4. Upon any breach by CARDAX, CAPSUGEL shall be permitted to use all Intellectual Property of CARDAX used in the Active Ingredient and the Product to the extent necessary for the development and marketing of the Product in accordance with the terms of the agreement as of the date of such termination (Section 10.2).\n\n5.

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether a party is subject to obligations after the termination or expiration of a contract, including things like post-termination transition, payment, transfer of IP, wind-down, last-buy, or similar commitments. They provided a context from a contract, so I need to look through that context to find the relevant sections.\n\nFirst, I'll start by reading through the context carefully. The first paragraph mentions that in the event of termination, each party must return the other's property, including proprietary information, within 30 days after termination, except what's required by law or to comply with continuing obligations. So that's a post-termination obligation about returning property. The mention of \"continuing obligations\" suggests there are other obligations that survive termination.\n\nLooking at Section 10.1 Term and Renewal, it says that any contract with a Marketer for the Product survives termination according to its terms. That's another post-termination obligation related to those specific contracts. Also, there's a part about neither party being the legal agent of the other, so they can't bind each other to third parties unless specifically authorized. This might relate to obligations if one party had assumed responsibilities on behalf of the other.\n\nSection 3.1 Background IP states that the agreement doesn't affect Background IP rights, and no rights are conferred except as provided. So maybe there's something about IP transfer here. Also, CAPSUGEL must retain records for five years after expiration or termination. That's a specific post-termination obligation regarding records.\n\nNow, the question is about whether there are obligations after termination, including various types like transition, payment, IP transfer, etc. The context mentions returning property (which could include IP transfer), retaining records (a specific obligation), and surviving contracts. The first paragraph also mentions \"continuing obligations hereunder,\" which implies that some obligations persist beyond termination. \n\nI need to check if there's any mention of payments or wind-down. The context doesn't explicitly talk about payments, but the returning of property might involve some transfer. The 30-day return period is a post-termination action. The record retention for five years is another obligation. The surviving contracts under 10.1 could involve ongoing obligations related to those contracts. \n\nThe answer should list the obligations found in the context. The user wants to know if there are such obligations. Based on the context, yes, there are several",

      "question": "Is a party restricted from contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty, whether during the contract or after the contract ends (or both)?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, the franchise agreement contains restrictions on the franchisee's ability to compete with Pretzel Time, both during the term of the franchise agreement and after its termination or expiration.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n1. During the term of the franchise agreement, the franchisee agrees that neither it, its affiliates, nor its owners will have any direct or indirect interest in a \"Competitive Business\" located at the franchise site, within 3 miles of the franchise unit, or within 3 miles of any other Pretzel Time unit in operation or under development (Section 21.A).\n\n2. After termination or expiration of the franchise agreement, the franchisee and its owners agree not to have any direct or indirect interest in a Competitive Business located at the franchise site, within 3 miles of the franchise unit, or within 3 miles of any other Pretzel Time unit in operation or under development for a period of 12 months (Section 20.G).\n\nThe agreement also restricts the franchisee from recruiting or hiring any employees who were employed by Pretzel Time or another Pretzel Time franchisee within the prior 6 months, without Pretzel Time's prior written permission (Section 21.A(2)).\n\nSo in summary, the franchise agreement imposes non-compete and non-solicitation restrictions on the franchisee both during the contract term and for a period after the contract ends.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether a party is restricted from contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty during or after the contract. The context provided is from a Franchise Agreement between Pretzel Time and a Franchisee.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the context for any clauses that mention restrictions on solicitation or contracting. The main sections here are under \"RELATIONSHIP OF THE PARTIES/INDEMNIFICATION\" and \"NO LIABILITY FOR ACTS OF OTHER PARTY.\"\n\nLooking at the first part, there's a section about the Franchisee agreeing not to have any interest in a Competitive Business within three miles of a Pretzel Time Unit. Then there's a point (2) that says the Franchisee can't recruit or hire any employee who was employed by Pretzel Time or its units in the preceding six months without permission. That seems like a restriction on soliciting employees, but not customers or partners.\n\nThe second section talks about the Franchisee needing Pretzel Time's consent before selling securities and not including Pretzel Time's information without permission. This doesn't directly address customers or partners.\n\nThe question is about customers or partners. The context doesn't mention anything about customers or partners being restricted. The only restrictions are on competitive businesses and employee recruitment. There's no mention of non-solicitation of customers or partners, either during or after the contract. Also, the duration mentioned for the restrictions is during the term of the Franchise Agreement or the period of operation, whichever is shorter. But even then, the restrictions are limited to employees and competitive businesses, not customers or partners.\n\nSo, based on the provided context, there's no explicit restriction on contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty. The answer should reflect that the context doesn't support such restrictions.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: The provided context does not explicitly restrict a party from contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty during or after the contract. The agreement prohibits the Franchisee from (1) holding interests in competitive businesses near Pretzel Time Units and (2) recruiting employees of Pretzel Time or its affiliates within six months of their employment. However, there is no mention of restrictions on soliciting customers or partners. The restrictions apply only to competitive business interests and employee recruitment, not to customers or partners.",
