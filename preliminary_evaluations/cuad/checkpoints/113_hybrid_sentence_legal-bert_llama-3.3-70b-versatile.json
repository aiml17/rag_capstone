      "question": "Is a party\u2019s liability uncapped upon the breach of its obligation in the contract? This also includes uncap liability for a particular type of breach such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality obligation.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the context provided in the Cooperation Agreement, there does not appear to be any uncapped liability for a party's breach of the contract. The agreement does not explicitly state that a party's liability is uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.\n\nThe relevant sections are:\n\n1. Clause 5 on Confidential Information, which states that the obligations of confidentiality shall remain in force until the relevant information enters the public domain otherwise than by the default of a party. This suggests there is no uncapped liability for breach of the confidentiality obligation.\n\n2. Clause 4.1 regarding QIWI's obligation to settle transactions through Otkritie's bank. This clause states that if QIWI terminates this obligation, it shall pay a fee to Otkritie, but this fee is capped at RUB 50,000,000. This indicates a cap on liability for breach of this specific obligation.\n\n3. The agreement does not contain any other provisions that suggest uncapped liability for breach of the contract or specific types of breaches. The dispute resolution clause (Clause 9) also does not indicate uncapped damages.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the Cooperation Agreement, the liability of the parties does not appear to be uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.",
      "generated_response": "No, a party's liability is not entirely uncapped upon the breach of its obligation in the contract. According to Clause 4.1, if QIWI terminates its obligation to settle at least half of the total transactions through PJSC Khanty-Mansiysk Bank Otkritie, it shall pay a fee to Otkritie, but such fee shall in no event exceed RUB 50,000,000 (fifty million roubles). This indicates that, at least for this specific type of breach, the liability is capped.\n\nHowever, the contract does not explicitly state that liabilities for other types of breaches, such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality obligations, are capped. In fact, Clause 5.1 imposes a confidentiality obligation on the parties, but it does not specify a cap on liability for breach of this obligation. Therefore, it can be inferred that liabilities for certain types of breaches, such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality obligations, may be uncapped, but this is not explicitly stated in the contract.",

      "question": "Is a party restricted from contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty, whether during the contract or after the contract ends (or both)?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, the franchise agreement contains restrictions on the franchisee's ability to compete with Pretzel Time, both during the term of the franchise agreement and after its termination or expiration.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n1. During the term of the franchise agreement, the franchisee agrees that neither it, its affiliates, nor its owners will have any direct or indirect interest in a \"Competitive Business\" located at the franchise site, within 3 miles of the franchise unit, or within 3 miles of any other Pretzel Time unit in operation or under development (Section 21.A).\n\n2. After termination or expiration of the franchise agreement, the franchisee and its owners agree not to have any direct or indirect interest in a Competitive Business located at the franchise site, within 3 miles of the franchise unit, or within 3 miles of any other Pretzel Time unit in operation or under development for a period of 12 months (Section 20.G).\n\nThe agreement also restricts the franchisee from recruiting or hiring any employees who were employed by Pretzel Time or another Pretzel Time franchisee within the prior 6 months, without Pretzel Time's prior written permission (Section 21.A(2)).\n\nSo in summary, the franchise agreement imposes non-compete and non-solicitation restrictions on the franchisee both during the contract term and for a period after the contract ends.",
      "generated_response": "The provided context does not explicitly state that a party is restricted from contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty. However, it does mention a non-compete provision, which may imply some restrictions, but notes that this provision may not be enforceable under the laws of the state. \n\nThe context primarily focuses on the use of marks, confidential information, and liabilities rather than directly addressing the solicitation of customers or partners. It emphasizes the importance of not using the marks in a way that could result in liability for the other party and the cessation of using confidential information upon termination or expiration of the agreement.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, it's not explicitly clear if there's a restriction on soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty during or after the contract. The context provided does not directly answer the question about restrictions on soliciting customers or partners.",

Except as expressly  authorized in writing,  neither Pretzel Time nor Franchisee shall  make  any  express  or  implied  agreements,  warranties,  guarantees  or representations  or  incur  any  debt in the  name or on  behalf  of the  other, represent that their relationship is other than Pretzel Time and franchisee,  or be obligated by or have any liability  under any  agreements or  representations made by the other that are not  expressly  authorized  in writing.",
