      "question": "Is a party\u2019s liability uncapped upon the breach of its obligation in the contract? This also includes uncap liability for a particular type of breach such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality obligation.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the context provided in the Cooperation Agreement, there does not appear to be any uncapped liability for a party's breach of the contract. The agreement does not explicitly state that a party's liability is uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.\n\nThe relevant sections are:\n\n1. Clause 5 on Confidential Information, which states that the obligations of confidentiality shall remain in force until the relevant information enters the public domain otherwise than by the default of a party. This suggests there is no uncapped liability for breach of the confidentiality obligation.\n\n2. Clause 4.1 regarding QIWI's obligation to settle transactions through Otkritie's bank. This clause states that if QIWI terminates this obligation, it shall pay a fee to Otkritie, but this fee is capped at RUB 50,000,000. This indicates a cap on liability for breach of this specific obligation.\n\n3. The agreement does not contain any other provisions that suggest uncapped liability for breach of the contract or specific types of breaches. The dispute resolution clause (Clause 9) also does not indicate uncapped damages.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the Cooperation Agreement, the liability of the parties does not appear to be uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.",
      "generated_response": "Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of liability caps or uncapped liability for breach of contract. However, it can be inferred that the parties' liability may be limited in certain circumstances.\n\nIn clause 7.2, it is stated that if any provision or part of the Agreement is void or unenforceable due to any Applicable Law, it shall be deemed to be deleted and the remaining provisions of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. This suggests that the parties may have intended to limit their liability in the event of a breach of contract.\n\nAdditionally, in clause 5.4, it is stated that if a party's Affiliate is compelled to disclose Confidential Information in Litigation, the disclosing party may disclose such portion of the Confidential Information without liability under the Agreement. This suggests that the parties may have intended to limit their liability for breach of confidentiality obligations in certain circumstances.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that the contract does not explicitly state that liability is capped or uncapped. Therefore, it is possible that the parties' liability may be unlimited in the event of a breach of contract.\n\nIn terms of uncap liability for a particular type of breach such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality obligation, the contract does not provide any specific guidance. However, it is possible that the parties may have intended to limit their liability for such breaches in certain circumstances, such as in clause 5.4.\n\nIn summary, while the contract does not explicitly state that liability is capped or uncapped, it can be inferred that the parties may have intended to limit their liability in certain circumstances. However, the exact nature and extent of liability for breach of contract is not explicitly stated in the contract.",

Upon any breach by CAPSUGEL, CARDAX shall be permitted to use all Intellectual Property of CAPSUGEL used in the Formulation and the Product to the extent necessary for the development and marketing of the Product (Section 10.2).\n\n4. Upon any breach by CARDAX, CAPSUGEL shall be permitted to use all Intellectual Property of CARDAX used in the Active Ingredient and the Product to the extent necessary for the development and marketing of the Product in accordance with the terms of the agreement as of the date of such termination (Section 10.2).\n\n5.

This implies that there may be ongoing obligations related to these contracts after termination.\n\nFurthermore, Section 10.3 and 10.2 outline specific circumstances under which the agreement may be terminated, but they do not explicitly state that all obligations cease upon termination. \n\nHowever, the section that explicitly states the obligations after termination is Section 10.1, which implies that there may be ongoing obligations related to contracts with Marketers, and the general obligation to return property and proprietary information.",

During the term of the franchise agreement, the franchisee agrees that neither it, its affiliates, nor its owners will have any direct or indirect interest in a \"Competitive Business\" located at the franchise site, within 3 miles of the franchise unit, or within 3 miles of any other Pretzel Time unit in operation or under development (Section 21.A).\n\n2. After termination or expiration of the franchise agreement, the franchisee and its owners agree not to have any direct or indirect interest in a Competitive Business located at the franchise site, within 3 miles of the franchise unit, or within 3 miles of any other Pretzel Time unit in operation or under development for a period of 12 months (Section 20.G).\n\nThe agreement also restricts the franchisee from recruiting or hiring any employees who were employed by Pretzel Time or another Pretzel Time franchisee within the prior 6 months, without Pretzel Time's prior written permission (Section 21.A(2)).\n\nSo in summary, the franchise agreement imposes non-compete and non-solicitation restrictions on the franchisee both during the contract term and for a period after the contract ends.",
