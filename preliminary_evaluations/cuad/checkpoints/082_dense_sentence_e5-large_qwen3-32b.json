      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking about the duration of any warranty against defects or errors in technology, products, or services provided under the contract. The context given is an amendment to a co-branding agreement between PC Quote, Inc. and A.B. Watley, Inc. The amendment is dated December 9, 1996, and the signatures are from December 5 and 12, 1996.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the provided context mentions anything about warranties. The context is an amendment to Section 2, Part B of the Co-Branding Agreement, which is titled \"Term.\" The term section usually deals with the duration of the contract, not warranties. The amendment itself doesn't have any content beyond the standard clauses about the parties involved and the effective date. The sources mentioned are SEC filings (S-1/A), which are related to stock offerings, but the actual text provided doesn't include any warranty clauses.\n\nSince the context only includes the amendment to the term section and the signatures, there's no information here about warranties. The question is about a warranty duration, which isn't addressed in the given text. Therefore, the answer would be that the provided context doesn't contain information on warranty duration. The user might need to refer to other sections of the original Co-Branding Agreement or additional amendments that specifically address warranties.\n</think>\n\nThe provided context does not include any specific information regarding the duration of warranties against defects or errors in technology, products, or services under the contract.

To determine the warranty duration, additional sections of the original Co-Branding Agreement or other amendments would need to be referenced. \n\nAnswer: The context does not specify the duration of any warranty against defects or errors in technology, products, or services provided under the contract.",

      "question": "Is a party\u2019s liability uncapped upon the breach of its obligation in the contract? This also includes uncap liability for a particular type of breach such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality obligation.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the context provided in the Cooperation Agreement, there does not appear to be any uncapped liability for a party's breach of the contract. The agreement does not explicitly state that a party's liability is uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.\n\nThe relevant sections are:\n\n1. Clause 5 on Confidential Information, which states that the obligations of confidentiality shall remain in force until the relevant information enters the public domain otherwise than by the default of a party. This suggests there is no uncapped liability for breach of the confidentiality obligation.\n\n2. Clause 4.1 regarding QIWI's obligation to settle transactions through Otkritie's bank. This clause states that if QIWI terminates this obligation, it shall pay a fee to Otkritie, but this fee is capped at RUB 50,000,000. This indicates a cap on liability for breach of this specific obligation.\n\n3. The agreement does not contain any other provisions that suggest uncapped liability for breach of the contract or specific types of breaches. The dispute resolution clause (Clause 9) also does not indicate uncapped damages.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the Cooperation Agreement, the liability of the parties does not appear to be uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out the answer to this question. The user is asking whether a party's liability is uncapped if they breach their obligations in the contract, specifically mentioning IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context to see if there's any mention of liability caps or limitations. The context includes several clauses from a contract, like 7.4, 7.5, 7.6, 8, and parts of 5.2, 5.3, 5.4. \n\nLooking at the confidentiality sections (5.2, 5.3, 5.4), they talk about when the confidentiality obligations don't apply, such as when required by law or for performance of the agreement. There's also mention of cooperation to mitigate disclosure. However, there's no explicit statement about liability being capped or uncapped. The clauses discuss the obligations to maintain confidentiality and steps to take if disclosure is required, but not the consequences of breaching those obligations.\n\nThe other clauses (7.4-7.6, 8) deal with execution of the agreement, assignment restrictions, third-party rights, and notices. Again, nothing about liability limits. \n\nSince the question is about whether liability is uncapped, I need to check if any part of the provided context limits liability. If there's no mention of a cap, then by default, the liability might be uncapped unless there's a specific exclusion. However, in contract law, sometimes if there's no explicit cap, the liability could be unlimited. But the user is asking specifically about the contract provided. Since the provided context doesn't include any clauses that limit liability, the answer would be that the liability is uncapped. \n\nBut wait, maybe there's an implied cap? Not necessarily. Unless the contract states that liability is limited, it's usually considered that parties can be liable for all damages resulting from a breach. The context doesn't mention any exclusions of liability or caps, so the answer would be yes, liability is uncapped.\n</think>\n\nThe provided context does not include any explicit provisions limiting or capping a party's liability for breaches of the contract, including specific breaches like IP infringement or confidentiality violations. The confidentiality clauses (e.g., 5.2\u20135.4) outline obligations to protect Confidential Information and steps to mitigate disclosure, but they do not address liability caps or exclusions.

      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, according to the General Provisions of the Sponsorship Agreement, the Sponsor (Rubio's Fresh Mexican Grill) must obtain and continuously maintain certain insurance policies for the benefit of the counterparty, SDBF (San Diego Ballpark Funding LLC):\n\nSpecifically, Section 8(c) states that Sponsor must obtain and continuously maintain the following insurance policies:\n\n1.

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if there's a requirement for insurance that one party must maintain for the benefit of the counterparty. The context provided is a legal agreement between the Padres Parties and a Sponsor.\n\nLooking through the context, there's a section under \"c.\" where the Sponsor is required to obtain and maintain certain insurance policies. Specifically, it mentions Workers' Compensation in compliance with California law, including Employers' Liability with specific minimum limits. Then there's also a Commercial General Liability Insurance Policy with occurrence-based coverage, including contractual liability and products/completed operations liability. The minimum limits are listed with placeholders, but the key point is that the Sponsor must maintain these at their own expense.\n\nThe question is whether this insurance is for the benefit of the counterparty, which in this case would be the Padres Parties. The Sponsor is the one getting the insurance, but since the agreement is between the Sponsor and the Padres, the insurance would likely be for the Padres' benefit. The context also mentions that if there's a claim against the Padres Parties, the Sponsor must defend it, which implies that the insurance is there to cover the Padres in case of such claims. \n\nAdditionally, the insurance policies are required to be maintained even after the agreement is terminated, which further shows that they're for the protection of the Padres Parties. The fact that the Sponsor has to get these policies at their own expense and that the Padres can participate in the defense (at their own expense) supports the idea that the insurance is for the counterparty's benefit.\n\nSo yes, the Sponsor must maintain insurance that benefits the Padres Parties. The answer should confirm that the Sponsor is required to have these insurance policies for the benefit of the Padres.\n</think>\n\nYes, the Sponsor is required to obtain and maintain specific insurance policies for the benefit of the Padres Parties.

The user is asking about the renewal term, including automatic extensions or unilateral extensions with prior notice.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the provided context. The context is a legal agreement between a Principal and a Distributor. Let me scan through the clauses mentioned.\n\nLooking at clause 10: \"This Agreement shall be in effect until March 18. 2021, unless sooner terminated by either party upon (30) days written notice, without cause.\" So the initial term is until March 18, 2021. But if either party gives 30 days written notice, they can terminate it before that date.\n\nNow, the question is about the renewal term after the initial term. The user is asking if there's any automatic renewal or if there's a way to extend the agreement beyond the initial term. Let me check the rest of the context for any mention of renewal or extension beyond March 18, 2021.\n\nLooking through the other clauses: There's mention of termination and what happens after termination, like the Distributor can sell ordered products. There's also a part about amendments to the product list and prices. But I don't see any clause that talks about the agreement automatically renewing after March 18, 2021. The only termination clause is the 30-day notice before the end date. \n\nClause 15 and 16 mention that the agreement supersedes prior agreements and that the Distributor can't assign the agreement without consent. There's no mention of a renewal term beyond the initial expiration date. The agreement just ends on March 18, 2021, unless terminated earlier. So if the initial term ends on that date, and there's no provision for automatic renewal, then the agreement would simply terminate on that date unless both parties agree to a new agreement. The context doesn't specify any automatic extension or renewal process. The only way to extend would be if both parties agree to a new term, but the question is about the renewal term as per the existing agreement. Since there's no mention of renewal, the answer would be that there is no automatic renewal or unilateral extension beyond the initial term.

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the contract contains a license grant to a licensee, including their affiliates. I need to check the provided context for any mention of licensing.\n\nLooking through the pages, on Page 27, there's a section labeled 11. SOFTWARE LICENSE. Specifically, 11.1 says Airspan grants Distributor a nonexclusive, non-transferable license to use and sublicense the Software. The license is for use on a single System or unit of Equipment. \n\nWait, the question mentions \"the affiliates of such licensee/sublicensor.\" The license here is given to the Distributor, and it allows sublicensing as set forth. But does it mention affiliates? The text says \"Distributor hereby accepts a nonexclusive, non-transferable license to use, and to sublicense as set forth below...\" So the sublicense is part of the grant. However, the term \"affiliates\" isn't explicitly mentioned here. The license is to the Distributor and allows them to sublicense, but unless the sublicense is extended to affiliates specifically, it might not cover them. \n\nLooking elsewhere in the context, I don't see any other sections that mention granting licenses to affiliates. The main license is to the Distributor, with a sublicense clause. The answer would depend on whether the sublicense includes affiliates. Since the context doesn't specify that the sublicense is to affiliates, only that the Distributor can sublicense as set forth, but the exact terms of the sublicense aren't detailed here. However, the question is about the license grant to the licensee (Distributor) and their affiliates. The main license is to the Distributor, so that's covered. The sublicense is part of the grant, but unless the sublicense is explicitly to affiliates, the answer might be no. \n\nBut the user is asking if the contract contains a license grant to the licensee (including affiliates). The main license is to the Distributor, which is the licensee. The sublicense is part of the grant, but the sublicense's scope isn't detailed here. The answer would be yes for the Distributor (licensee) but not necessarily for their affiliates unless the sublicense includes them. Since the context doesn't specify that the sublicense is to affiliates, the answer might be that the license is granted to the Distributor (licensee) and allows sublicensing, but the inclusion of affiliates isn't explicitly stated.

Also, terms like \"Fund\", \"Calculation and Paying Agent\", and \"Commission\" are defined.\n\nLooking at the sections listed, there's a mention of \"Remarketing Agreement\" in Section 10, which is titled \"Termination of Remarketing Agreement\". Additionally, there's a section titled \"Remarketing Agent's Performance; Duty of Care\" in Section 11. The term \"Tender and Paying Agent Agreement\" is mentioned in the definition of \"Calculation and Paying Agent\". \n\nThe document also includes a Tender Notice with details about the Beneficial Owner, Agent Member, contact information, and obligations related to tendering shares. The mention of \"VRRM-MFP Shares\" suggests this is related to a specific financial instrument or fund.\n\nPutting this together, the main contract here seems to be the \"Remarketing Agreement\", as it's referenced in the sections and the sections discuss termination and the agent's duties. The \"Tender and Paying Agent Agreement\" is another agreement referenced, but the primary contract in question here is likely the Remarketing Agreement.

Then there's 10.8 Survival, which mentions that certain sections (like 3.6, 4, 6, 8, 9, and 11) survive termination. Section 11 includes Miscellaneous provisions like Dispute Resolution, Assignment, Waiver, etc.\n\nAlso, in Section 8.5 Insurance, there's a requirement to maintain insurance for two years after termination or expiry of the Agreement. That's a post-termination obligation. \n\nSection 11.3 Assignment talks about not assigning without consent, but there's an exception for mergers or sales. Not sure if that's relevant here. \n\nThe Limitation of Liability in section 8 (probably 8.4?) mentions that liability is limited to revenues received under the Agreement. But how does that tie into post-termination? Maybe not directly, but the survival of certain sections would include those terms.\n\nThe key points here are the survival clauses (10.8 Survival) and specific obligations that continue after termination. The 10.7 Property requires returning property, which is a post-termination obligation. The insurance in 8.5 also continues for two years. Also, the survival of sections like 3.6, 4, 6, 8, 9, and 11 means that any obligations in those sections would still apply after termination. For example, if section 4 includes payment terms or IP transfer, those would be part of the surviving obligations. \n\nAdditionally, the context mentions \"other obligations of the Parties hereunder\" in 10.7, implying there might be other commitments beyond just returning property. The question mentions transition, payment, transfer of IP, wind-down, etc. If those are covered in the surviving sections (like section 4 for IP transfer, section 6 for payments),",

      "question": "Is a party restricted from contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty, whether during the contract or after the contract ends (or both)?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, the franchise agreement contains restrictions on the franchisee's ability to compete with Pretzel Time, both during the term of the franchise agreement and after its termination or expiration.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n1. During the term of the franchise agreement, the franchisee agrees that neither it, its affiliates, nor its owners will have any direct or indirect interest in a \"Competitive Business\" located at the franchise site, within 3 miles of the franchise unit, or within 3 miles of any other Pretzel Time unit in operation or under development (Section 21.A).\n\n2. After termination or expiration of the franchise agreement, the franchisee and its owners agree not to have any direct or indirect interest in a Competitive Business located at the franchise site, within 3 miles of the franchise unit, or within 3 miles of any other Pretzel Time unit in operation or under development for a period of 12 months (Section 20.G).\n\nThe agreement also restricts the franchisee from recruiting or hiring any employees who were employed by Pretzel Time or another Pretzel Time franchisee within the prior 6 months, without Pretzel Time's prior written permission (Section 21.A(2)).\n\nSo in summary, the franchise agreement imposes non-compete and non-solicitation restrictions on the franchisee both during the contract term and for a period after the contract ends.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out the answer to this question. The user is asking whether a party is restricted from contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty during the contract or after it ends, or both. The context provided is a legal document, probably a franchise agreement between Pretzel Time and a Franchisee.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the context for any clauses that mention non-compete, non-solicitation, or similar terms. The user mentioned sections like 23.C. COVENANT NOT TO COMPETE and 21.A. EXCLUSIVE RELATIONSHIP. Let me check those sections.\n\nLooking at 21.A. EXCLUSIVE RELATIONSHIP, it says that the Franchisee agrees not to hold interests in or perform services for a Competitive Business except as specified. This suggests that during the contract, the Franchisee can't work with competitors. But does it mention anything about customers or partners? The part about Confidential Information and dealing exclusively with Pretzel Time might imply some restrictions, but not directly about soliciting customers.\n\nThen there's 23.C. COVENANT NOT TO COMPETE. The section number is there, but the actual text isn't fully provided in the context. However, the mention of \"COVENANT NOT TO COMPETE\" in the context usually refers to non-compete clauses. Non-compete clauses often restrict a party from engaging in similar business activities, which could include soliciting customers or partners. But without the exact text of 23.C, I need to infer based on standard legal terms.\n\nAlso, in 21.A., the Franchisee acknowledges that Pretzel Time would be unable to protect Confidential Information if Franchisees were allowed to work with competitors. This might tie into non-solicitation, but again, not explicitly stated here.\n\nAnother part to consider is the Confidential Information section (CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION...63). If the Franchisee is restricted from disclosing confidential info, that could indirectly prevent them from using that info to solicit customers or partners after the contract ends.\n\nThe question is about both during and after the contract. The context doesn't mention a specific duration for the non-compete or non-solicit clause, but typically such clauses have a time limit post-termination. However, since the exact terms of 23.C aren't provided, I have to rely on the references given.\n\nGiven that there's a",

The context is an amendment to a co-branding agreement between PC Quote, Inc. (PCQ) and A.B. Watley, Inc. (ABW). The amendment is about Section 2, Part B, which is titled \"Term.\" The document mentions that the amendment is effective December 9, 1996, and it's signed by both parties with dates of December 5 and December 12, 1996.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what an exclusive dealing commitment entails.
