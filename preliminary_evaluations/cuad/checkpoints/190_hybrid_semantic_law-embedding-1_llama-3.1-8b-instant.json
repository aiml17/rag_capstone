      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the context provided in the Cooperation Agreement, there does not appear to be any uncapped liability for a party's breach of the contract. The agreement does not explicitly state that a party's liability is uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.\n\nThe relevant sections are:\n\n1. Clause 5 on Confidential Information, which states that the obligations of confidentiality shall remain in force until the relevant information enters the public domain otherwise than by the default of a party. This suggests there is no uncapped liability for breach of the confidentiality obligation.\n\n2. Clause 4.1 regarding QIWI's obligation to settle transactions through Otkritie's bank. This clause states that if QIWI terminates this obligation, it shall pay a fee to Otkritie, but this fee is capped at RUB 50,000,000. This indicates a cap on liability for breach of this specific obligation.\n\n3. The agreement does not contain any other provisions that suggest uncapped liability for breach of the contract or specific types of breaches. The dispute resolution clause (Clause 9) also does not indicate uncapped damages.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the Cooperation Agreement, the liability of the parties does not appear to be uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.",

However, the contract does not contain any provisions that would suggest a cap on liability for breach of obligations, including confidentiality obligations.\n\nIn fact, the contract does not contain any provisions that would limit the liability of a party for breach of contract, including breach of confidentiality obligations. This suggests that a party's liability for breach of its obligations under the contract may be uncapped.\n\nIt is worth noting that the contract does contain provisions that require a party to take reasonable steps to preserve confidentiality and to mitigate the effects of any disclosure of confidential information. However, these provisions do not necessarily imply a cap on liability for breach of confidentiality obligations.\n\nIn the absence of any explicit provisions limiting liability, it is likely that a party's liability for breach of its obligations under the contract, including confidentiality obligations, would be uncapped. However, this would depend on the specific circumstances of the breach and the applicable laws of England and Wales, as specified in clause 9.1 of the contract.",

The provisions of Sections 3.6, 4, 6, 8, 9 and 11 shall survive any termination of the agreement (Section 10.8).\n\n2. Any contract entered into by the Parties with a Marketer for the Product shall survive termination of the agreement in accordance with its terms, including any renewal rights provided therein (Section 10.1). \n\n3. Upon any breach by CAPSUGEL, CARDAX shall be permitted to use all Intellectual Property of CAPSUGEL used in the Formulation and the Product to the extent necessary for the development and marketing of the Product (Section 10.2).\n\n4. Upon any breach by CARDAX, CAPSUGEL shall be permitted to use all Intellectual Property of CARDAX used in the Active Ingredient and the Product to the extent necessary for the development and marketing of the Product in accordance with the terms of the agreement as of the date of such termination (Section 10.2).\n\n5.

      "generated_response": "Based on the provided context, specifically Section 10, it appears that a party may be subject to certain obligations after the termination or expiration of a contract. \n\nSection 10.1 states that \"any contract entered into by the Parties with a Marketer for the Product shall survive termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, including any renewal rights provided therein.\" This suggests that certain contracts related to the Product may continue to be in effect even after the termination of the main agreement.\n\nHowever, it does not explicitly state that the parties are subject to post-termination transition, payment, transfer of IP, wind-down, last-buy, or similar commitments. The section only mentions that contracts with a Marketer for the Product will survive termination, but it does not provide a comprehensive list of post-termination obligations.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that a party may be subject to certain obligations after the termination or expiration of a contract, but the specific nature and scope of these obligations are not clearly defined in the provided context.",

The document appears to be an amendment to the \"Section 2, Part B of the Co-Branding Agreement\" between PC Quote, Inc. (PCQ) and A.B. Watley, Inc. (ABW), but it does not contain any details about exclusivity or prohibitions on collaborating with third parties. The document focuses on the term and effective date of the amendment, and it is signed by the representatives of the two companies, but there are no clauses indicating an exclusive dealing arrangement. Without any such provisions explicitly stated, the available information does not suggest the presence of an exclusive dealing commitment in this context.",
