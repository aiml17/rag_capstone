      "question": "Is a party\u2019s liability uncapped upon the breach of its obligation in the contract? This also includes uncap liability for a particular type of breach such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality obligation.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the context provided in the Cooperation Agreement, there does not appear to be any uncapped liability for a party's breach of the contract. The agreement does not explicitly state that a party's liability is uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.\n\nThe relevant sections are:\n\n1. Clause 5 on Confidential Information, which states that the obligations of confidentiality shall remain in force until the relevant information enters the public domain otherwise than by the default of a party. This suggests there is no uncapped liability for breach of the confidentiality obligation.\n\n2. Clause 4.1 regarding QIWI's obligation to settle transactions through Otkritie's bank. This clause states that if QIWI terminates this obligation, it shall pay a fee to Otkritie, but this fee is capped at RUB 50,000,000. This indicates a cap on liability for breach of this specific obligation.\n\n3. The agreement does not contain any other provisions that suggest uncapped liability for breach of the contract or specific types of breaches. The dispute resolution clause (Clause 9) also does not indicate uncapped damages.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the Cooperation Agreement, the liability of the parties does not appear to be uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.",
      "generated_response": "Based on the provided context, it appears that a party's liability is not entirely uncapped upon the breach of its obligation in the contract.\n\nFor instance, in Clause 4.1, QIWI covenants to settle at least half of the total transactions processed by the Contact money transfer system through PJSC Khanty-Mansiysk Bank Otkritie for two years. If QIWI terminates its obligation under this clause, it must pay a fee equal to the demonstrated costs incurred by Otkritie for the period starting from 1 September 2014, until the date of termination. However, this fee is capped at RUB 50,000,000 (fifty million roubles).\n\nAdditionally, in Clause 5.2, the obligations of confidentiality do not apply in certain circumstances, but there is no mention of uncapped liability for breach of confidentiality obligations.\n\nHowever, in Clause 9.7, it is mentioned that nothing in the contract limits the rights of the parties to bring proceedings against another party in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce an arbitration award or make a claim for interim or injunctive relief. This implies that a party's liability may not be capped in certain situations, but it does not explicitly state that liability is uncapped.\n\nIn summary, while there are some instances where a party's liability may not be capped, such as the fee payable under Clause 4.1, it is not entirely clear whether a party's liability is uncapped upon the breach of its obligation in the contract.",
