      "question": "Is a party\u2019s liability uncapped upon the breach of its obligation in the contract? This also includes uncap liability for a particular type of breach such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality obligation.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the context provided in the Cooperation Agreement, there does not appear to be any uncapped liability for a party's breach of the contract. The agreement does not explicitly state that a party's liability is uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.\n\nThe relevant sections are:\n\n1. Clause 5 on Confidential Information, which states that the obligations of confidentiality shall remain in force until the relevant information enters the public domain otherwise than by the default of a party. This suggests there is no uncapped liability for breach of the confidentiality obligation.\n\n2. Clause 4.1 regarding QIWI's obligation to settle transactions through Otkritie's bank. This clause states that if QIWI terminates this obligation, it shall pay a fee to Otkritie, but this fee is capped at RUB 50,000,000. This indicates a cap on liability for breach of this specific obligation.\n\n3. The agreement does not contain any other provisions that suggest uncapped liability for breach of the contract or specific types of breaches. The dispute resolution clause (Clause 9) also does not indicate uncapped damages.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the Cooperation Agreement, the liability of the parties does not appear to be uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.",
      "generated_response": "Based on the provided context, it appears that the liability of a party for breaching its obligations under the contract is not explicitly capped. However, the contract does not provide for uncapped liability either.\n\nIn Clause 5.4, it is mentioned that if a party's Affiliate is compelled to disclose Confidential Information in Litigation, the Representative may disclose such portion of the Confidential Information without liability under this Agreement. This suggests that the liability for breaching confidentiality obligations may be limited in certain circumstances.\n\nHowever, there is no specific provision in the contract that caps the liability for breaching confidentiality obligations or for other types of breaches, such as IP infringement. Therefore, it is likely that the liability for such breaches would be subject to the general principles of contract law, which may allow for damages to be awarded based on the actual loss suffered by the other party.\n\nIn terms of IP infringement, the contract does not provide any specific provisions regarding liability for such breaches. However, it is likely that the liability for IP infringement would be subject to the general principles of intellectual property law, which may allow for damages to be awarded based on the actual loss suffered by the other party.\n\nIn summary, while the contract does not explicitly cap liability for breaching its obligations, it also does not provide for uncapped liability. The liability for such breaches would likely be subject to the general principles of contract law and intellectual property law.",

The provisions of Sections 3.6, 4, 6, 8, 9 and 11 shall survive any termination of the agreement (Section 10.8).\n\n2. Any contract entered into by the Parties with a Marketer for the Product shall survive termination of the agreement in accordance with its terms, including any renewal rights provided therein (Section 10.1). \n\n3. Upon any breach by CAPSUGEL, CARDAX shall be permitted to use all Intellectual Property of CAPSUGEL used in the Formulation and the Product to the extent necessary for the development and marketing of the Product (Section 10.2).\n\n4. Upon any breach by CARDAX, CAPSUGEL shall be permitted to use all Intellectual Property of CARDAX used in the Active Ingredient and the Product to the extent necessary for the development and marketing of the Product in accordance with the terms of the agreement as of the date of such termination (Section 10.2).\n\n5. Each Party shall return to the other Party or to the other Party's designee no later than thirty (30) days after the effective date of termination all of such other Party's property, including all proprietary information, in its possession, except to the extent required to be retained by law or to comply with such Party's continuing obligations (Section 10.7).\n\nSo in summary, yes there are certain post-termination obligations, including the survival of certain provisions, the continuing effect of third-party contracts, and the return of proprietary information and materials.",
      "generated_response": "Yes, a party is subject to obligations after the termination or expiration of a contract. \n\nSection 10.7 of the contract states that in the event of termination, each party shall return to the other party all of such other party's property, including all proprietary information, in its possession, except to the extent required to be retained by law or to comply with such party's continuing obligations hereunder. \n\nAdditionally, Section 10.8 states that the provisions of Sections 3.6, 4, 6, 8, 9, and 11 shall survive any termination of this Agreement. Section 11.1, which is one of the surviving provisions, mentions \"Force Majeure\" which may cause a delay in performance of obligations, but does not exempt a party from all post-termination obligations.\n\nFurthermore, Section 10.2 Termination for Breach, mentions that upon any breach by CAPSUGEL, CARDAX shall be permitted to use all Intellectual Property of CAPSUGEL used in the Formulation and the Product to the extent necessary for the development and marketing of the Product. This implies that CARDAX has certain post-termination rights and obligations regarding the use of CAPSUGEL's Intellectual Property.\n\nTherefore, it can be concluded that a party is subject to obligations after the termination or expiration of a contract, including any post-termination transition, payment, transfer of IP, wind-down, last-buy, or similar commitments.",

      "question": "Is a party restricted from contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty, whether during the contract or after the contract ends (or both)?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, the franchise agreement contains restrictions on the franchisee's ability to compete with Pretzel Time, both during the term of the franchise agreement and after its termination or expiration.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n1. During the term of the franchise agreement, the franchisee agrees that neither it, its affiliates, nor its owners will have any direct or indirect interest in a \"Competitive Business\" located at the franchise site, within 3 miles of the franchise unit, or within 3 miles of any other Pretzel Time unit in operation or under development (Section 21.A).\n\n2. After termination or expiration of the franchise agreement, the franchisee and its owners agree not to have any direct or indirect interest in a Competitive Business located at the franchise site, within 3 miles of the franchise unit, or within 3 miles of any other Pretzel Time unit in operation or under development for a period of 12 months (Section 20.G).\n\nThe agreement also restricts the franchisee from recruiting or hiring any employees who were employed by Pretzel Time or another Pretzel Time franchisee within the prior 6 months, without Pretzel Time's prior written permission (Section 21.A(2)).\n\nSo in summary, the franchise agreement imposes non-compete and non-solicitation restrictions on the franchisee both during the contract term and for a period after the contract ends.",
      "generated_response": "Based on the provided context, it appears that there is a non-competition provision mentioned in Section 17 and also in Section 23, but it is not explicitly stated that a party is restricted from contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty.\n\nHowever, Section 17.E.(3) mentions that \"Franchisee and all shareholders must continue to meet its obligations under the noncompetition provisions of this Agreement.\" This suggests that there is a non-competition provision in the agreement, but it does not provide details on what that provision entails.\n\nAdditionally, Section 23.B. mentions that the rights of the parties are cumulative, but it does not provide any information on non-competition provisions.\n\nTo determine the exact scope of the non-competition provision, it would be necessary to review the entire agreement or the specific section that outlines the non-competition provision.\n\nHowever, based on the context, it can be inferred that there is a non-competition provision, but its exact details are not provided.",
