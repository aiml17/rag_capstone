      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the context provided in the Cooperation Agreement, there does not appear to be any uncapped liability for a party's breach of the contract. The agreement does not explicitly state that a party's liability is uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.\n\nThe relevant sections are:\n\n1. Clause 5 on Confidential Information, which states that the obligations of confidentiality shall remain in force until the relevant information enters the public domain otherwise than by the default of a party. This suggests there is no uncapped liability for breach of the confidentiality obligation.\n\n2. Clause 4.1 regarding QIWI's obligation to settle transactions through Otkritie's bank. This clause states that if QIWI terminates this obligation, it shall pay a fee to Otkritie, but this fee is capped at RUB 50,000,000. This indicates a cap on liability for breach of this specific obligation.\n\n3. The agreement does not contain any other provisions that suggest uncapped liability for breach of the contract or specific types of breaches. The dispute resolution clause (Clause 9) also does not indicate uncapped damages.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the Cooperation Agreement, the liability of the parties does not appear to be uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether a party's liability is uncapped in case of a breach of the contract, specifically mentioning IP infringement or breach of confidentiality. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context to see if there's any mention of liability caps or limitations. The context includes clauses 5.1 to 5.4 about confidentiality and clauses 7.1 to 7.6 about other terms like assignment and third-party rights.\n\nLooking at the confidentiality clauses (5.1-5.4), they outline the obligations not to disclose confidential information and exceptions. However, there's no mention of limiting liability for breaches. The clauses specify what the parties must do regarding confidentiality but don't state that liability is capped. \n\nThen, checking the other clauses, especially 7.5 and 7.6, which deal with assignment and third-party rights. Still, no mention of liability caps. The rest of the clauses (like 7.2) talk about severability if a provision is void, but again, not about liability limits.\n\nSince the entire provided context doesn't include any clauses that limit or cap liability for breaches, including specific ones like IP infringement or confidentiality breaches, the answer would be that the liability is uncapped. The contract doesn't have any provisions that restrict the amount of damages a party could be liable for upon breach. Therefore, the default position in contract law would apply, which is that liability isn't capped unless explicitly stated. Since there's no such statement here, the liability remains uncapped.\n</think>\n\nThe provided context does not include any specific clauses that explicitly cap or limit a party's liability for breaches of the contract, including breaches of confidentiality obligations or IP infringement. The confidentiality clauses (5.1\u20135.4) outline the obligations and exceptions for handling Confidential Information but do not address liability limitations. Similarly, other clauses (e.g., 7.1\u20137.6) focus on assignment, third-party rights, and severability but do not mention liability caps. \n\nIn the absence of explicit language limiting liability (e.g., \"liability is limited to [specific amount]\" or \"no liability for indirect damages\"), the default legal principle applies: **a party\u2019s liability for breach of contract is generally uncapped unless the contract expressly limits it**.

      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, according to the General Provisions of the Sponsorship Agreement, the Sponsor (Rubio's Fresh Mexican Grill) must obtain and continuously maintain certain insurance policies for the benefit of the counterparty, SDBF (San Diego Ballpark Funding LLC):\n\nSpecifically, Section 8(c) states that Sponsor must obtain and continuously maintain the following insurance policies:\n\n1. Workers' Compensation insurance with minimum liability limits.\n\n2. An occurrence-based Commercial General Liability Insurance Policy with minimum liability limits.\n\nThe policies must name SDBF, Padres LP, the City of San Diego, and their subsidiary/affiliated companies and directors/officers/employees as Additional Insureds. The policies must also contain Cross Liability Endorsements and a Waiver of Subrogation in favor of SDBF.\n\nSponsor must provide SDBF with certificates of insurance evidencing compliance with these insurance requirements prior to the commencement of the sponsorship and annually prior to the expiration of each required insurance policy.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if there's a requirement for insurance that one party must maintain for the benefit of the counterparty. The context provided is about insurance policies that the Sponsor must obtain and maintain.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the context carefully. The Sponsor is required to get insurance from an admitted carrier with an A.M. Indemnity, Insurance, and Assumption of the Risk. They have to maintain these policies continuously at their own expense. Also, there's a part about providing certificates of insurance to SDBF before the sponsorship starts and annually. \n\nThen there's a mention of coverage for Additional Insureds applying on a primary basis regardless of other insurance. That part might be important because it indicates that the insurance is for the benefit of others (Additional Insureds), which could be the counterparty here. \n\nThe question is about whether one party (the Sponsor) must maintain insurance for the counterparty's (SDBF's) benefit. The context says that the Sponsor must provide certificates to SDBF and that the coverage for Additional Insureds is primary. So, the insurance is not just for the Sponsor's own benefit but also for others, specifically SDBF as the Additional Insured. \n\nAlso, the notice requirement of 30 days for cancellation or modification suggests that SDBF needs to be informed, which implies their interest in the policy. The fact that the insurance must be maintained continuously and that certificates are provided annually reinforces that SDBF is a beneficiary here. \n\nSo putting it all together, the Sponsor is required to maintain insurance policies that cover SDBF as Additional Insureds. Therefore, yes, there is a requirement for insurance maintained by the Sponsor for the benefit of the counterparty (SDBF).\n</think>\n\nYes, the Sponsor is required to maintain insurance policies that include SDBF as an Additional Insured, ensuring coverage for their benefit. The context specifies that the Sponsor must obtain and maintain insurance policies (e.g., indemnity, insurance, and assumption of risk) with coverage for Additional Insureds (likely SDBF) on a **primary basis**, regardless of other insurance. Additionally, the Sponsor must provide SDBF with certificates of insurance and notify SDBF 30 days before cancellation, non-renewal, or material modification.

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the contract contains a license grant to a licensee, including their affiliates. Let me look through the provided context carefully.\n\nFirst, in section 1.1, it mentions that Airspan appoints Distributor as an independent, exclusive distributor. The Distributor gets a license to resell Airspan Products in the Territory. But it also states that this doesn't transfer any rights, title, or interest in the Airspan Software. So the license here is specifically for reselling the products, not the software itself.\n\nThen, section 11.1 is about the software license. It says Airspan grants the Distributor a nonexclusive, non-transferable license to use and sublicense the Software. The key part here is \"non-transferable,\" which means the Distributor can't transfer the license to others. However, there's a mention of sublicensing \"as set forth below,\" but looking further, there's no specific mention of affiliates. The license is limited to use on a single System or unit of Equipment provided by Airspan. Also, the Distributor can't sublicense unless specified in writing by Airspan.\n\nSection 11.2 adds more restrictions: the Distributor must treat the Software as confidential, can't modify it, and can't reproduce it except for backups. There's no mention of affiliates being included in the license. The license is strictly for the Distributor's use on Airspan's equipment.\n\nThe question is about whether the license extends to the licensee's affiliates. The contract refers to the Distributor (the licensee) but doesn't explicitly mention affiliates. The term \"non-transferable\" suggests that the license can't be passed on to others, including affiliates. Unless there's a specific clause allowing sublicensing to affiliates, which I don't see here. The only sublicensing mentioned is under 11.1, but it's conditional on Airspan's agreement. Since there's no explicit inclusion of affiliates, the answer would be no.\n\nSo, the contract does grant a license to the Distributor (licensee), but not to their affiliates. The license is non-transferable, and there's no provision allowing sublicensing to affiliates unless Airspan agrees in writing. Therefore, the answer is no.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: No, the contract does not explicitly grant a license to the affiliates of the licensee/sublicensor.

Let me read through the context again to find any mentions of a contract name.\n\nLooking at the context, there are several sections labeled (ii), (iii), (iv), etc. The first part talks about the execution and delivery of \"this Agreement\" and mentions that it's a legal, valid, and binding agreement. There's also a mention of \"the transactions contemplated hereby.\" \n\nIn section (g), it says, \"Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the Agent shall receive a letter from The Accounting & Consulting Group L.L.P...\" So here, \"this Agreement\" is referenced again. \n\nThe context seems to be part of a legal document, possibly a contract between parties, where \"this Agreement\" is referred to multiple times.

      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, based on the information provided in the agreement, there are certain obligations that continue after the termination or expiration of the contract:\n\n1. The provisions of Sections 3.6, 4, 6, 8, 9 and 11 shall survive any termination of the agreement (Section 10.8).\n\n2. Any contract entered into by the Parties with a Marketer for the Product shall survive termination of the agreement in accordance with its terms, including any renewal rights provided therein (Section 10.1). \n\n3. Upon any breach by CAPSUGEL, CARDAX shall be permitted to use all Intellectual Property of CAPSUGEL used in the Formulation and the Product to the extent necessary for the development and marketing of the Product (Section 10.2).\n\n4. Upon any breach by CARDAX, CAPSUGEL shall be permitted to use all Intellectual Property of CARDAX used in the Active Ingredient and the Product to the extent necessary for the development and marketing of the Product in accordance with the terms of the agreement as of the date of such termination (Section 10.2).\n\n5. Each Party shall return to the other Party or to the other Party's designee no later than thirty (30) days after the effective date of termination all of such other Party's property, including all proprietary information, in its possession, except to the extent required to be retained by law or to comply with such Party's continuing obligations (Section 10.7).\n\nSo in summary, yes there are certain post-termination obligations, including the survival of certain provisions, the continuing effect of third-party contracts, and the return of proprietary information and materials.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether a party has obligations after the termination or expiration of a contract, specifically mentioning post-termination transition, payment, transfer of IP, wind-down, last-buy, or similar commitments.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the provided context. The context includes several sections from the agreement. Let's break them down.\n\nStarting with the first paragraph under the termination section: It says that upon termination, each party must return the other's property, including proprietary information, within 30 days, unless required by law or to comply with continuing obligations. So that's a clear obligation after termination\u2014returning property. Also, there's mention of \"continuing obligations,\" which implies there are other duties beyond just returning property.\n\nLooking at Section 10.1 Term and Renewal: It mentions that contracts with a Marketer for the Product survive termination according to their own terms. So any such contracts aren't automatically terminated and might have their own renewal rights. That could relate to post-termination obligations if those contracts require certain actions.\n\nSection 10.2 Termination for Breach: If there's a material breach that's not cured within a certain period, the agreement can be terminated. However, if the breaching party is diligently working to cure it, the cure period can be extended. This might tie into obligations after termination if there's a need to resolve the breach even after termination.\n\nSection 3.1 Background IP: It states that the agreement doesn't grant rights to Background IP except as provided. The survival of Sections 3.6, 4, 6, 8, 9, and 11 after termination is mentioned. These sections likely include obligations related to IP, payments, or other terms. For example, if Section 3.6 deals with IP licensing, that might require continued obligations post-termination.\n\nThe question also asks about specific areas like payment, transfer of IP, wind-down, etc. The first paragraph's mention of returning property (which includes IP) within 30 days is a direct obligation. The survival of certain sections (like 3.6, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11) would mean that any obligations in those sections remain. For example, if Section 4 is about payments, those payment terms might still apply after termination. Similarly, if Section 6 deals with transition or wind-down,",

      "question": "Is a party restricted from contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty, whether during the contract or after the contract ends (or both)?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, the franchise agreement contains restrictions on the franchisee's ability to compete with Pretzel Time, both during the term of the franchise agreement and after its termination or expiration.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n1. During the term of the franchise agreement, the franchisee agrees that neither it, its affiliates, nor its owners will have any direct or indirect interest in a \"Competitive Business\" located at the franchise site, within 3 miles of the franchise unit, or within 3 miles of any other Pretzel Time unit in operation or under development (Section 21.A).\n\n2. After termination or expiration of the franchise agreement, the franchisee and its owners agree not to have any direct or indirect interest in a Competitive Business located at the franchise site, within 3 miles of the franchise unit, or within 3 miles of any other Pretzel Time unit in operation or under development for a period of 12 months (Section 20.G).\n\nThe agreement also restricts the franchisee from recruiting or hiring any employees who were employed by Pretzel Time or another Pretzel Time franchisee within the prior 6 months, without Pretzel Time's prior written permission (Section 21.A(2)).\n\nSo in summary, the franchise agreement imposes non-compete and non-solicitation restrictions on the franchisee both during the contract term and for a period after the contract ends.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if a party is restricted from contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty during or after the contract ends. I need to check the provided context for any clauses that mention non-compete, non-solicitation, or similar terms.\n\nLooking at the context, there are three sections mentioned: K, B, and another part. \n\nSection K is about a Third Party Assignment Agreement. It mentions that failing to transfer interest within a certain time is a breach. But that's about assignment, not non-compete or solicitation.\n\nSection B is titled \"Permitted Competitive Businesses, Form Development Agreement...\" and mentions \"NO LIABILITY FOR ACTS OF OTHER PARTY.\" Hmm, the title includes \"Permitted Competitive Businesses,\" which might suggest that some competition is allowed. But the exact terms aren't clear here. The \"No liability\" part might mean that one party isn't responsible for the other's actions, but that's not directly about solicitation.\n\nThen there's a part about the obligations being conditional on executing documents within 10 days. If the Franchisee doesn't sign, the agreement is void. Still, nothing about non-solicitation.\n\nThe question is about restrictions on contracting or soliciting customers or partners. The context provided doesn't have explicit clauses about non-compete or non-solicitation. The sections mentioned don't address those restrictions. The \"Permitted Competitive Businesses\" might imply that some competition is allowed, but without specific language, it's hard to say. Since there's no direct mention of restrictions on solicitation or competition post-contract, the answer would be that the context doesn't provide enough information to confirm such restrictions. The answer should be that there's no restriction based on the given context.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: The provided context does not explicitly state any restrictions on a party's ability to contract with or solicit customers or partners of the counterparty during or after the contract. The documents referenced (e.g., Third Party Assignment Agreement, Permitted Competitive Businesses Agreement) focus on obligations related to assignment, development, and document execution but do not include clauses addressing non-compete, non-solicitation, or post-termination restrictions.

They mentioned looking for commitments like procuring all requirements from one party, prohibitions on licensing/selling to others, or collaboration restrictions, either during or after the contract.\n\nFirst, I need to check the context given. The context includes parts of a Co-Branding Agreement and an amendment to Section 2 (Term) between PC Quote, Inc. (PCQ) and A.B. Watley, Inc. (ABW). The amendment is dated December 9, 1996, and it's part of the Co-Branding Agreement. The signatories are Steven Malin from ABW and Howard Meltzer from PCQ. \n\nLooking at the sections provided, the main part is the amendment to the Term section. The amendment applies to PCQ and ABW and their subsidiaries. However, the actual content of the amendment isn't detailed here\u2014only the title and the parties involved. The rest of the context includes the agreement being agreed upon by the two companies with dates in December 1996.\n\nThe key here is whether the amendment or the original Co-Branding Agreement includes exclusive dealing terms. The user's question is about whether there's an exclusive commitment. The provided context doesn't include the full text of the Co-Branding Agreement or the amendment's details. The only mention is the amendment to the Term section. Without seeing the actual terms of the amendment, it's hard to determine if exclusivity is mentioned. \n\nSince the user's context doesn't provide the specific language of the amendment or the original agreement's Section 2, Part B, there's no explicit mention of exclusivity clauses. The answer would have to be based on the absence of such information. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, there's no indication of an exclusive dealing commitment. The answer should state that there's no evidence provided in the context to confirm such a commitment.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: The provided context does not include the specific terms of the Co-Branding Agreement or the amendment to Section 2 (Term) beyond the parties involved and the amendment's effective date. There is no explicit mention of exclusive dealing commitments, requirements to procure goods/services exclusively from one party, prohibitions on working with third parties, or post-contract restrictions. Therefore, **there is no evidence in the provided context to confirm an exclusive dealing",
