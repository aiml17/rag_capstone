The amendment is to Section 2, Part B, which is titled \"Term.\" The Term section usually outlines how long the agreement is in effect.

The amendment is about the term of the agreement, specifying the effective dates and the parties involved. The signatures are from December 5, 1996, and December 12, 1996, but those dates are likely the dates when the amendment was signed, not the duration of the warranty.\n\nSince the context doesn't include any information about warranties or their duration, the answer would be that the provided context does not specify the duration of any warranty against defects or errors.

Warranties or guarantees related to defects/errors are typically addressed in separate sections of a contract (e.g., \"Warranties\" or \"Representations and Warranties\"), which are not included in the provided excerpt.

      "question": "Is a party\u2019s liability uncapped upon the breach of its obligation in the contract? This also includes uncap liability for a particular type of breach such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality obligation.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the context provided in the Cooperation Agreement, there does not appear to be any uncapped liability for a party's breach of the contract. The agreement does not explicitly state that a party's liability is uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.\n\nThe relevant sections are:\n\n1. Clause 5 on Confidential Information, which states that the obligations of confidentiality shall remain in force until the relevant information enters the public domain otherwise than by the default of a party. This suggests there is no uncapped liability for breach of the confidentiality obligation.\n\n2. Clause 4.1 regarding QIWI's obligation to settle transactions through Otkritie's bank. This clause states that if QIWI terminates this obligation, it shall pay a fee to Otkritie, but this fee is capped at RUB 50,000,000. This indicates a cap on liability for breach of this specific obligation.\n\n3. The agreement does not contain any other provisions that suggest uncapped liability for breach of the contract or specific types of breaches. The dispute resolution clause (Clause 9) also does not indicate uncapped damages.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the Cooperation Agreement, the liability of the parties does not appear to be uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether a party's liability is uncapped in case of a breach of the contract, specifically mentioning IP infringement or confidentiality breaches. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context to see if there's any mention of liability caps. The context includes clauses 5.1 to 5.4 about confidentiality and 7.5 and 7.6 about assignment and third-party rights. \n\nLooking at the confidentiality clauses (5.1-5.4), they outline the obligations not to disclose confidential information and exceptions. However, there's no mention of limiting liability for breaches. For example, if someone breaches confidentiality, the clauses specify what they can't do and under what circumstances disclosure is allowed, but they don't state that liability is capped. \n\nThen, checking other parts of the contract like 7.5 and 7.6, those are about assignment and third-party rights, which don't relate to liability caps. The rest of the context provided doesn't include any clauses about liability limitations or exclusions. \n\nSince there's no clause in the provided context that limits liability for breaches, especially for IP infringement or confidentiality, the answer would be that liability is uncapped. The contract doesn't have any terms that cap the liability, so the default would be that parties can be held fully liable for damages resulting from breaches.\n</think>\n\nThe provided context does not include any specific clauses that explicitly cap or limit a party's liability for breaches of the contract, including breaches of confidentiality obligations or IP infringement.

Similarly, other clauses (e.g., 7.5 and 7.6) pertain to assignment and third-party rights, not liability caps. \n\n**Answer:** Yes, a party\u2019s liability is uncapped upon breach of its obligations under the contract, including for breaches of confidentiality or IP infringement, as the context does not contain any provisions limiting or capping liability.",

      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, according to the General Provisions of the Sponsorship Agreement, the Sponsor (Rubio's Fresh Mexican Grill) must obtain and continuously maintain certain insurance policies for the benefit of the counterparty, SDBF (San Diego Ballpark Funding LLC):\n\nSpecifically, Section 8(c) states that Sponsor must obtain and continuously maintain the following insurance policies:\n\n1. Workers' Compensation insurance with minimum liability limits.\n\n2. An occurrence-based Commercial General Liability Insurance Policy with minimum liability limits.\n\nThe policies must name SDBF, Padres LP, the City of San Diego, and their subsidiary/affiliated companies and directors/officers/employees as Additional Insureds. The policies must also contain Cross Liability Endorsements and a Waiver of Subrogation in favor of SDBF.\n\nSponsor must provide SDBF with certificates of insurance evidencing compliance with these insurance requirements prior to the commencement of the sponsorship and annually prior to the expiration of each required insurance policy.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if there's a requirement for insurance that one party must maintain for the benefit of the counterparty. The context provided mentions that the Sponsor must obtain and maintain certain insurance policies at their own expense. The first point under the Sponsor's obligations is \"Indemnity; Insurance; and Assumption of the Risk.\" Then it says that coverage for Additional Insureds applies on a primary basis regardless of other insurance.\n\nSo, the Sponsor is required to have insurance policies, specifically mentioning that Additional Insureds are covered. The term \"Additional Insureds\" usually refers to other parties who are added to the insurance policy for their benefit. That suggests that the Sponsor's insurance is for the benefit of these Additional Insureds, which could be the counterparty or other related parties.\n\nThe question is whether there's a requirement for one party to maintain insurance for the counterparty's benefit. Since the Sponsor must maintain insurance that includes Additional Insureds, and the coverage is primary regardless of other insurance, it seems like yes. The Sponsor's insurance is intended to protect the Additional Insureds, which would be the counterparty here. The context also states that each party is a sophisticated commercial entity, so they understand the terms. Therefore, the answer should confirm that there is such a requirement.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: Yes, the Sponsor is required to obtain and maintain insurance policies (including coverage for Additional Insureds) at its own expense, with the coverage for Additional Insureds applying on a primary basis regardless of other insurance.

The license is granted to the Distributor, and the Distributor can sublicense, but there's no mention of affiliates being included in that grant. \n\nSection 11.1 states that the license is non-transferable. If the Distributor is the licensee, then their affiliates would typically be considered separate entities unless the license specifically includes them. Since the license is non-transferable, the Distributor can't transfer it to affiliates. However, the Distributor might be able to sublicense to affiliates if allowed, but the context doesn't specify that. The sublicense is only permitted as set forth in 11.1, but the details of who can be sublicensed aren't given here. \n\nAlso, in 11.2, the Distributor must use the Software only on Systems provided by Airspan. There's no mention of affiliates being allowed to use it. The obligations apply to the Distributor and any sublicensees, but again, affiliates aren't explicitly covered. \n\nThe other sections like 6.1 and 21.6 don't seem relevant to the scope of the license regarding affiliates. The question is specifically about the license grant to the licensee and their affiliates. Since the contract doesn't mention affiliates in the license terms, and the license is non-transferable, it's likely that the license doesn't extend to affiliates. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the contract does not explicitly grant a license to the licensee's affiliates. The license is limited to the Distributor and any sublicensors as permitted, but without",

Let me read through the context again to make sure I don't miss anything.\n\nThe context is about a payment of expenses section, with clauses (i) and (j) discussing the Company, MHC, and Bank not selling stock without consent and registering common stock under Section 12(g) of the 1934 Act. Then there are representations and warranties from the Agent, points (xv) to (xvii) talking about legal proceedings, material contracts, and compliance with laws.\n\nThe user wants the name of the contract. But looking through the text, I don't see any specific contract named. The terms mentioned are more about legal documents like the Prospectus, Registration Statement, MHC Application, Plan, and references to laws like the 1934 Act. The clauses (i), (j), (xv), etc., are parts of a larger agreement, but the actual name of the contract isn't provided here. The context seems to be part of a legal or financial agreement, perhaps a securities offering document, but without a specific title given. \n\nSince there's no explicit mention of a contract name, the answer might be that there isn't one provided in the context. Alternatively, maybe the contract is referred to implicitly, like the \"Plan\" mentioned in clause (j) and (xvii), but \"Plan\" is too generic. The Prospectus and Registration Statement are documents but not contracts. The MHC Application is a formality. The user might be expecting a specific name, but based on the given text, it's not there. So the answer is that the name isn't specified in the provided context.\n</think>\n\nThe provided context does not explicitly mention the name of a specific contract. The text includes references to legal and financial documents such as the **Prospectus**, **Registration Statement**, **MHC Application**, and **Plan**, but these are not identified by a specific contract name.

      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, based on the information provided in the agreement, there are certain obligations that continue after the termination or expiration of the contract:\n\n1. The provisions of Sections 3.6, 4, 6, 8, 9 and 11 shall survive any termination of the agreement (Section 10.8).\n\n2. Any contract entered into by the Parties with a Marketer for the Product shall survive termination of the agreement in accordance with its terms, including any renewal rights provided therein (Section 10.1). \n\n3. Upon any breach by CAPSUGEL, CARDAX shall be permitted to use all Intellectual Property of CAPSUGEL used in the Formulation and the Product to the extent necessary for the development and marketing of the Product (Section 10.2).\n\n4. Upon any breach by CARDAX, CAPSUGEL shall be permitted to use all Intellectual Property of CARDAX used in the Active Ingredient and the Product to the extent necessary for the development and marketing of the Product in accordance with the terms of the agreement as of the date of such termination (Section 10.2).\n\n5.

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether a party is subject to obligations after the termination or expiration of a contract, including things like post-termination transition, payments, transfer of IP, wind-down, last-buy, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the provided context. The context is a legal contract section, specifically about termination and obligations. Let me go through each part.\n\nThe first paragraph says that upon termination, each party must return the other's property and proprietary information within 30 days, unless required by law or for continuing obligations. So that's a clear post-termination obligation regarding returning property and IP.\n\nSection 10.1 mentions that contracts with a Marketer survive termination. So there's a survival clause for those specific contracts. Also, renewal rights in those contracts would still apply. That's another post-termination obligation.\n\nThen there's a part about not being legal agents of each other. They can't make commitments on behalf of the other unless authorized. This might relate to obligations if one party tried to bind the other after termination, but the question is about existing obligations.\n\nNext, during the term and for two years after termination or expiry of the last batch, each party must maintain product liability insurance. That's a post-termination obligation for insurance.\n\nThe last part says that not terminating due to a breach isn't a waiver for future breaches. This is more about the right to terminate rather than ongoing obligations.\n\nPutting this together, the answer should include returning property/IP, maintaining insurance for two years, surviving contracts with marketers, and any other obligations specified in the agreement. The question mentions transition, payments, transfer of IP, etc. The context specifically covers returning property (IP transfer), insurance (which is a financial obligation), and surviving contracts. There's no explicit mention of payments or last-buy, but the general answer would be yes, there are obligations post-termination as outlined in the context.\n</think>\n\nYes, parties are subject to obligations after the termination or expiration of the contract. These include:  \n1. **Returning property and proprietary information** within 30 days of termination, unless legally required to retain it.  \n2. **Maintaining product liability insurance** for two years after termination or the expiry of the last batch manufactured.  \n3. **Surviving contracts** with third-party Marketers, which remain in effect according to their terms.  \n4. **Complying with non-wa",

      "question": "Is a party restricted from contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty, whether during the contract or after the contract ends (or both)?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, the franchise agreement contains restrictions on the franchisee's ability to compete with Pretzel Time, both during the term of the franchise agreement and after its termination or expiration.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n1. During the term of the franchise agreement, the franchisee agrees that neither it, its affiliates, nor its owners will have any direct or indirect interest in a \"Competitive Business\" located at the franchise site, within 3 miles of the franchise unit, or within 3 miles of any other Pretzel Time unit in operation or under development (Section 21.A).\n\n2. After termination or expiration of the franchise agreement, the franchisee and its owners agree not to have any direct or indirect interest in a Competitive Business located at the franchise site, within 3 miles of the franchise unit, or within 3 miles of any other Pretzel Time unit in operation or under development for a period of 12 months (Section 20.G).\n\nThe agreement also restricts the franchisee from recruiting or hiring any employees who were employed by Pretzel Time or another Pretzel Time franchisee within the prior 6 months, without Pretzel Time's prior written permission (Section 21.A(2)).\n\nSo in summary, the franchise agreement imposes non-compete and non-solicitation restrictions on the franchisee both during the contract term and for a period after the contract ends.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if a party is restricted from contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty during or after the contract ends, based on the provided context.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the context given. The context includes a clause titled \"NO LIABILITY FOR ACTS OF OTHER PARTY\" and another part about agreements needing to be in writing and executed by both parties. There's also a mention of \"RELATIONSHIP OF THE PARTIES/INDEMNIFICATION\" and \"THIRD PARTY ASSIGNMENT AGREEMENT\". \n\nThe key part here is the \"NO LIABILITY FOR ACTS OF OTHER PARTY\" clause. This usually means that one party isn't responsible for the actions of the other. But the user is asking about restrictions on soliciting customers or partners. The context doesn't explicitly mention non-solicitation clauses. The main points in the context are about agreements needing to be in writing and the no liability clause. \n\nSince there's no specific mention of non-compete or non-solicitation terms in the provided context, the answer would be that the context doesn't address those restrictions. The user might be expecting a standard answer based on typical contract clauses, but without that specific language here, the answer has to be based solely on the given text. So, the answer should state that the provided context doesn't include such restrictions.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: The provided context does not explicitly address restrictions on contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty during or after the contract. The text focuses on requirements for written agreements and liability limitations but does not include non-solicitation or non-compete clauses. Therefore, based on the given information, there is no indication that such restrictions apply.",

(ABW), but it does not contain any details about exclusivity or prohibitions on collaborating with third parties. The document focuses on the term and effective date of the amendment, and it is signed by the representatives of the two companies, but there are no clauses indicating an exclusive dealing arrangement. Without any such provisions explicitly stated, the available information does not suggest the presence of an exclusive dealing commitment in this context.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if there's an exclusive dealing commitment in the provided context. The context is about an amendment to a co-branding agreement between PC Quote, Inc. (PCQ) and A.B. Watley, Inc. (ABW). The amendment is dated December 9, 1996, and signed by both parties.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the document mentions any exclusivity. The question is about whether there's a commitment to procure all requirements from one party, or prohibitions on dealing with others. The context provided is pretty limited. The main parts are the amendment to Section 2 (Term) of the Co-Branding Agreement. The amendment applies to PCQ and ABW and their subsidiaries. \n\nLooking at the sections provided, there's no explicit mention of exclusivity. The term \"exclusive\" isn't in the text. The amendment is about the term, which might relate to the duration of the agreement, but not necessarily exclusivity. The co-branding agreement itself could have other sections, but the context here only includes the amendment to Section 2, Part B. \n\nThe user's question is about exclusive dealing commitments, which would typically be in other sections like the scope of the agreement, obligations of the parties, etc. Since the provided context doesn't include those sections, there's no information here about exclusivity. The answer would have to be that based on the given information, there's no indication of an exclusive dealing commitment. The amendment doesn't mention exclusivity, so we can't infer it from this document alone.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: The provided context does not include any explicit language indicating an exclusive dealing commitment. The amendment focuses on the term of the Co-Branding Agreement and applies to PCQ and ABW (and their subsidiaries), but there is no mention of exclusivity, requirements to procure goods/services solely from one party, prohibitions on licensing/selling to third parties, or restrictions on collaboration with others. Without additional details from other sections of the agreement, no exclusive dealing commitment is evident here. \n\n**Answer:** No, the provided context does not disclose an exclusive dealing commitment.",
