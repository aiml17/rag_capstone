      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking about the duration of any warranty against defects or errors in technology, products, or services provided under the contract. The context given is an amendment to a co-branding agreement between PC Quote, Inc. and A.B. Watley, Inc. The documents mention dates like December 9, 1996, and the amendment is part of Section 2, Part B of the Co-Branding Agreement.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the provided context includes any information about warranties. The context given is the amendment to the Term section. The main content here is the agreement between the two companies, the dates they agreed, and the amendment's effective date. However, the actual text of the amendment isn't provided here. The user's question is about the warranty duration, which might be in the original Co-Branding Agreement or in the amendment. But since the context only includes the amendment's existence and the parties involved, not the specific terms of the warranty, there's no explicit mention of warranty duration here.\n\nThe user might be expecting that the answer is in the provided context, but looking at the text, there's no mention of warranties, defects, errors, or any duration related to them.

      "question": "Is a party\u2019s liability uncapped upon the breach of its obligation in the contract? This also includes uncap liability for a particular type of breach such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality obligation.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the context provided in the Cooperation Agreement, there does not appear to be any uncapped liability for a party's breach of the contract. The agreement does not explicitly state that a party's liability is uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.\n\nThe relevant sections are:\n\n1. Clause 5 on Confidential Information, which states that the obligations of confidentiality shall remain in force until the relevant information enters the public domain otherwise than by the default of a party. This suggests there is no uncapped liability for breach of the confidentiality obligation.\n\n2. Clause 4.1 regarding QIWI's obligation to settle transactions through Otkritie's bank. This clause states that if QIWI terminates this obligation, it shall pay a fee to Otkritie, but this fee is capped at RUB 50,000,000. This indicates a cap on liability for breach of this specific obligation.\n\n3. The agreement does not contain any other provisions that suggest uncapped liability for breach of the contract or specific types of breaches. The dispute resolution clause (Clause 9) also does not indicate uncapped damages.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the Cooperation Agreement, the liability of the parties does not appear to be uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether a party's liability is uncapped if they breach the contract, especially in cases like IP infringement or confidentiality breaches. I need to look through the provided context to see if there's any mention of liability caps or exclusions.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the clauses. The context includes several sections: 7.1, 7.2, 7.5, 7.6, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4. These mainly deal with partnership status, enforceability, assignment, confidentiality, and disclosure of confidential information. \n\nLooking at the confidentiality clauses (5.1-5.4), they outline when disclosure is allowed and the obligations to maintain confidentiality. However, there's no mention of limiting liability for breaches. The clauses specify the obligations but don't state that liability is excluded or capped. \n\nIn the other sections, like 7.2, there's a severability clause, meaning if a part is invalid, the rest remains. But again, nothing about liability caps. The assignment clauses (7.5) prevent assignment without permission, but again, not related to liability. \n\nSince there's no explicit clause in the provided context that limits liability for breaches, especially in confidentiality or IP infringement, the default assumption would be that liability isn't capped. Unless a contract specifically states that liability is limited, it's generally considered uncapped. The user's question is about whether the liability is uncapped, and based on the absence of any limiting terms, the answer would be yes.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: The provided context does not include any explicit provisions limiting or capping a party's liability for breaches of the contract, including specific breaches such as IP infringement or confidentiality violations. Therefore, **a party\u2019s liability is not capped** upon breach of its obligations under the agreement. The clauses focus on defining obligations (e.g., confidentiality, non-assignment) and severability of invalid provisions but do not address liability limitations. Absent a specific exclusion or cap on liability in the contract, liability for breaches would generally remain uncapped under standard contractual principles.",

The policies must also contain Cross Liability Endorsements and a Waiver of Subrogation in favor of SDBF.\n\nSponsor must provide SDBF with certificates of insurance evidencing compliance with these insurance requirements prior to the commencement of the sponsorship and annually prior to the expiration of each required insurance policy.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if there's a requirement for insurance that one party must maintain for the benefit of the counterparty. The context provided is a Sponsorship Agreement with some insurance provisions.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the context for any mentions of insurance. The first part says the Sponsor must obtain and maintain insurance policies at their own expense. The insurance is from an admitted carrier with an A.M. rating. Then there's a Commercial General Liability Policy with specific coverage and limits. \n\nThe key part here is that the Sponsor is required to have this insurance, which includes contractual liability and products/completed operations. The question is whether this insurance is for the benefit of the counterparty. Since the Sponsor is the one getting the insurance, but the Collateral Trustee is mentioned in the notice requirements, maybe the Collateral Trustee is the counterparty here. \n\nAlso, there's a part about the Sponsor not being able to claim prevention or interference without giving notice to the Collateral Trustee. The Collateral Trustee has the right to cure defaults within 120 days. This suggests that the insurance is maintained for the benefit of the Collateral Trustee, as they have a stake in ensuring the Sponsor doesn't default. \n\nAdditionally, the Sponsor can't amend the agreement without the Collateral Trustee's consent, which reinforces that the Trustee's interests are protected through these insurance requirements. The Indemnity section also implies that the insurance is part of the risk management for both parties, but specifically, the Sponsor's obligation is to maintain it, and the Trustee's rights are protected through notice and cure periods.\n\nSo putting it all together, the Sponsor must maintain the insurance, which is for the benefit of the Collateral Trustee (the counterparty) to ensure that any defaults can be addressed, and the Trustee's interests are protected. Therefore, the answer should be yes, there is such a requirement.\n</think>\n\nYes, the Sponsor is required to maintain specific insurance policies (e.g., Commercial General Liability Insurance) at their own expense, which are intended to benefit the Collateral Trustee. The insurance ensures the Trustee has the opportunity to address defaults (e.g., by curing them within 120 days) and protects their interests in the event of the Sponsor\u2019s failure to fulfill obligations. The Sponsor cannot amend the agreement without the Trustee\u2019s consent, further emphasizing the Trustee\u2019s role as",

The Agreement is effective until March 18, 2021, unless terminated earlier by either party with 30 days written notice. The conditions mention that upon termination, the Distributor can receive orders accepted before termination and sell the products in the Territory. There's also a clause stating that there are no other agreements, and this supersedes all prior ones. Also, the list of Products and prices can be amended from time to time.\n\nThe key part here is the termination clause. The initial term ends on March 18, 2021. The question is about the renewal term after that. The context doesn't mention anything about automatic renewal. The termination is by either party giving 30 days notice.

There's no mention of what happens after March 18, 2021, if the agreement isn't terminated. The answer should be that there's no automatic renewal; the agreement just ends on the specified date unless terminated earlier. The user might be looking for whether there's a renewal period or if it's silent on that.

The context provided is from a legal agreement between Airspan and a Distributor.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the context for any mention of license grants. The first part of the context is section 11.1, which talks about Airspan granting the Distributor a nonexclusive, non-transferable license to use and sublicense the Software. The key here is \"non-transferable,\" which usually means the Distributor can't transfer the license to others, but the mention of \"subliclicense as set forth below\" suggests there's some sublicensing allowed. However, the specifics of that sublicensing aren't detailed here.\n\nThen in section 11.2, there are more restrictions on the Distributor regarding the Software, like not modifying it or reverse engineering. But the main license grant is in 11.1. The question is about whether the license includes the licensee (Distributor) and their affiliates. The term \"affiliates\" isn't explicitly mentioned in the provided context. The license is given to the Distributor, and the Distributor is allowed to sublicense, but the context doesn't specify if that sublicense extends to affiliates. \n\nLooking at section 1.1, it mentions that the Distributor is appointed as an independent distributor to resell products in the Territory. However, the license to resell doesn't necessarily equate to a software license for affiliates. The main software license in 11.1 is non-transferable, which might mean that the Distributor can't transfer the license to their affiliates. Unless there's a specific clause allowing that, which isn't present here.\n\nSo, based on the provided context, the license is granted to the Distributor (the licensee) and allows them to sublicense, but there's no mention of affiliates being included. The non-transferable clause might prevent sublicensing to affiliates unless explicitly allowed. Since the context doesn't mention affiliates, the answer would be that the license is granted to the Distributor but not explicitly to their affiliates. Therefore, the answer is no, unless the sublicense is extended to affiliates, which isn't stated here.\n</think>\n\nThe contract grants a **nonexclusive, non-transferable license** to the Distributor (the licensee) to use and sublicense the Software, as outlined in Section 11.1.

      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, based on the information provided in the agreement, there are certain obligations that continue after the termination or expiration of the contract:\n\n1. The provisions of Sections 3.6, 4, 6, 8, 9 and 11 shall survive any termination of the agreement (Section 10.8).\n\n2. Any contract entered into by the Parties with a Marketer for the Product shall survive termination of the agreement in accordance with its terms, including any renewal rights provided therein (Section 10.1). \n\n3. Upon any breach by CAPSUGEL, CARDAX shall be permitted to use all Intellectual Property of CAPSUGEL used in the Formulation and the Product to the extent necessary for the development and marketing of the Product (Section 10.2).\n\n4. Upon any breach by CARDAX, CAPSUGEL shall be permitted to use all Intellectual Property of CARDAX used in the Active Ingredient and the Product to the extent necessary for the development and marketing of the Product in accordance with the terms of the agreement as of the date of such termination (Section 10.2).\n\n5.

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether a party is subject to obligations after the termination or expiration of a contract, including things like post-termination transition, payments, IP transfer, wind-down, last-buy, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the provided context. The context includes several sections from a contract, specifically under Section 10 about Term and Termination. Let me go through each part to see what obligations are mentioned.\n\nStarting with the first paragraph: It says that upon termination, each party must return the other's property, including proprietary information, within 30 days, unless required by law to retain it. So that's a post-termination obligation regarding returning property.\n\nSection 10.1 mentions that contracts with a Marketer for the Product survive termination. So there's an obligation to maintain those contracts even after the main agreement ends.\n\nThen there's a part about maintaining product liability insurance for two years after termination or expiry. That's a clear post-termination obligation related to insurance.\n\nSection 10.3 allows termination if the other party becomes bankrupt, which is a termination condition but also implies obligations upon termination.\n\nThe last paragraph states that neither party is an agent of the other, so they can't bind each other to third parties unless specifically authorized. This might relate to obligations if they acted beyond their authority, but it's more about liability than post-termination obligations.\n\nPutting this together, the contract does outline several post-termination obligations: returning property, maintaining insurance, and allowing survival of certain contracts. The question mentions transition, payments, IP transfer, etc. The context specifically mentions returning proprietary information (which could be IP), so that's covered. The other parts like payments or wind-down aren't explicitly mentioned here, but the answer should focus on what's in the context.\n\nThe answer should confirm that yes, there are obligations after termination, such as returning property, maintaining insurance, and surviving contracts. The user's question includes terms like \"post-termination transition\" which might align with returning property, and \"transfer of IP\" which is part of returning proprietary information. The answer should list the specific obligations mentioned in the context.\n</think>\n\nYes, a party is subject to obligations after the termination or expiration of the contract. The context outlines several post-termination commitments, including:  \n1. **Return of Property/IP**: Each party must return the other\u2019s property (including proprietary information) within 3",

The user is asking whether a party is restricted from contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty during or after the contract. The context provided is a franchise agreement from Pretzel Time.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the context for any clauses that mention restrictions on solicitation or dealing with customers or partners. The main part here is the section starting with \"Franchisee therefore agrees that during the term of the Franchise Agreement...\" which lists two main restrictions. \n\nThe first part (1) talks about not having any interest in a competitive business within 3 miles of a Pretzel Time unit. The second part (2) specifically mentions not recruiting or hiring employees of Pretzel Time or its units within the past six months without permission. However, the question is about customers or partners, not employees. \n\nLooking further, there's a mention in the next paragraph about raising funds by selling securities and needing Pretzel Time's consent. But that's about financing, not customers or partners. \n\nThe key part here is section (2) which prohibits recruiting employees, but there's no explicit mention of customers or partners. The user is asking about customers and partners, which aren't directly addressed in the provided context. The answer would depend on whether the agreement includes non-solicitation clauses for customers or partners. Since the context doesn't mention such restrictions, the answer would be that based on the provided information, there's no restriction on customers or partners, only on employees and competitive businesses. \n\nWait, but the user is asking about \"contracting or soliciting customers or partners\". The context doesn't mention customers or partners being restricted. The only restriction related to solicitation is about employees. So the answer would be that the context doesn't restrict customers or partners, only employees and competitive businesses. Therefore, the answer is no, unless there's another part I missed. Let me check again. The context does mention \"Recruit or hire any employee\" but not customers or partners.

      "question": "Is there an exclusive dealing\u00a0 commitment with the counterparty? This includes a commitment to procure all \u201crequirements\u201d from one party of certain technology, goods, or services or a prohibition on licensing or selling technology, goods or services to third parties, or a prohibition on\u00a0 collaborating or working with other parties), whether during the contract or\u00a0 after the contract ends (or both).",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the information provided in the context, there does not appear to be any explicit mention of an exclusive dealing commitment or requirement for the counterparty. The document appears to be an amendment to the \"Section 2, Part B of the Co-Branding Agreement\" between PC Quote, Inc. (PCQ) and A.B. Watley, Inc. (ABW), but it does not contain any details about exclusivity or prohibitions on collaborating with third parties. The document focuses on the term and effective date of the amendment, and it is signed by the representatives of the two companies, but there are no clauses indicating an exclusive dealing arrangement. Without any such provisions explicitly stated, the available information does not suggest the presence of an exclusive dealing commitment in this context.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if there's an exclusive dealing commitment in the provided context. The context is about an amendment to a Co-Branding Agreement between PC Quote, Inc. (PCQ) and A.B. Watley, Inc. (ABW). The question is whether this agreement includes any exclusivity, like requiring one party to buy all their needs from the other, or prohibiting them from working with others.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided documents. The context mentions an \"Amendment to Section 2, Part B of the Co-Branding Agreement\" effective December 9, 1996. The amendment is between PCQ and ABW. The key part here is Section 2, which is titled \"Term.\" The term usually refers to the duration of the contract, not necessarily exclusivity. \n\nLooking at the text provided, the amendment is about modifying the term. The rest of the context includes signatures from Steven Malin and Howard Meltzer, dates, and references to subsidiaries and related companies. There's no mention of exclusivity clauses, requirements to procure all goods/services from one party, prohibitions on licensing to third parties, or restrictions on collaborating with others. \n\nThe Co-Branding Agreement itself isn't fully detailed here, but the amendment specifically addresses the term. Since the question is about exclusive dealing commitments, and the provided text doesn't include any such terms, it's likely that there's no exclusivity. However, I should check if there's any implied exclusivity in the amendment. The amendment applies to PCQ and ABW and their subsidiaries, but that's about scope, not exclusivity. \n\nNo other parts of the provided context mention exclusivity. The answer would be that there's no indication of an exclusive dealing commitment based on the given information. The amendment is about the term's duration, not exclusivity. Therefore, the answer should be no.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: No, the provided context does not indicate an exclusive dealing commitment. The amendment modifies the \"Term\" of the Co-Branding Agreement but does not specify exclusivity requirements (e.g., procuring all goods/services from one party, prohibitions on working with third parties, or post-contract restrictions). The text focuses on the agreement\u2019s duration and applicability to subsidiaries but omits clauses enforcing exclusivity in dealings.",
