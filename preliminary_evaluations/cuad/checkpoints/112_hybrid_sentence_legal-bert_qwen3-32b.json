The user is asking about the duration of any warranty against defects or errors in technology, products, or services provided under the contract. The context given is an amendment to a co-branding agreement between PC Quote, Inc. and A.B. Watley, Inc. The amendment is effective December 9, 1996, and it's part of Section 2, Part B, which is titled \"Term.\" \n\nFirst, I need to recall what a \"Term\" section typically covers in a contract. The term section usually outlines the duration of the agreement, when it starts, when it ends, and any renewal terms. However, the user is asking specifically about warranties related to defects or errors in technology, products, or services. That's usually covered in a different section of a contract, often under a \"Warranties\" or \"Representations and Warranties\" clause.\n\nLooking at the provided context, the amendment is to Section 2, Part B, which is about the Term.

The S-1/A might include more details, but the user hasn't provided that information here. \n\nSince the context given is only about the amendment to the Term section, there's no information here about the warranty duration. The answer would need to be that the provided context doesn't contain the necessary information to answer the question. The user might need to look into other sections of the Co-Branding Agreement, specifically any part that deals with warranties, or check the original agreement before this amendment for such terms. Alternatively, if there's a separate warranty section in the S-1/A filing, that might have the details, but without that data, it's impossible to tell.\n</think>\n\nThe provided context focuses on an amendment to the \"Term\" section of the Co-Branding Agreement between PC Quote, Inc. and A.B.

      "question": "Is a party\u2019s liability uncapped upon the breach of its obligation in the contract? This also includes uncap liability for a particular type of breach such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality obligation.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the context provided in the Cooperation Agreement, there does not appear to be any uncapped liability for a party's breach of the contract. The agreement does not explicitly state that a party's liability is uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.\n\nThe relevant sections are:\n\n1. Clause 5 on Confidential Information, which states that the obligations of confidentiality shall remain in force until the relevant information enters the public domain otherwise than by the default of a party. This suggests there is no uncapped liability for breach of the confidentiality obligation.\n\n2. Clause 4.1 regarding QIWI's obligation to settle transactions through Otkritie's bank. This clause states that if QIWI terminates this obligation, it shall pay a fee to Otkritie, but this fee is capped at RUB 50,000,000. This indicates a cap on liability for breach of this specific obligation.\n\n3. The agreement does not contain any other provisions that suggest uncapped liability for breach of the contract or specific types of breaches. The dispute resolution clause (Clause 9) also does not indicate uncapped damages.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the Cooperation Agreement, the liability of the parties does not appear to be uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether a party's liability is uncapped if they breach the contract, including specific breaches like IP infringement or confidentiality. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context to find any clauses that mention liability caps or exceptions. The context includes several sections from a contract between QIWI and Otkritie. \n\nLooking at the Bank Services section (Clause 4.1), there's a mention of a termination fee. If QIWI terminates their obligation, they have to pay a fee equal to Otkritie's demonstrated costs, but it's capped at 50 million rubles. That's a specific cap for that particular breach (terminating the obligation under Clause 4.1). \n\nThen, in the Confidential Information section (Clause 5.1), there's a requirement not to disclose or use confidential information, but there's no mention of a cap on liability for breaching that. Similarly, other parts of the contract like Governing Law and Dispute Resolution don't talk about liability caps beyond the specific termination fee.\n\nThe question is about whether liability is uncapped in general. The termination fee example shows a cap for a specific breach. However, the user is asking if there are any breaches where liability is uncapped. Since the contract only specifies a cap for the termination fee, other breaches like confidentiality might not have a cap mentioned. \n\nBut the answer needs to consider if there's a general cap clause. The context doesn't mention a general cap on liability. The only cap is for the termination fee. So, for other breaches (like confidentiality or IP infringement), unless there's a specific cap, liability would be uncapped. The contract doesn't state that there's a general cap, so the answer would be that liability is not uncapped in all cases. Specifically, the termination fee is capped, but other breaches might not be. However, the question is phrased as \"is a party\u2019s liability uncapped upon the breach of its obligation in the contract?\" The answer would be no, because there is at least one instance where liability is capped (the termination fee), but for other breaches, unless specified, it's not capped. But the question is whether it's uncapped in general. Since there's a cap in one case, but not mentioned elsewhere, the answer would be that liability is not entirely uncapped. However, the user is asking if it",

The context provided is a legal agreement between SDBF and a Sponsor.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the context for any mentions of insurance requirements. The context starts by talking about policies needing a Waiver of Subrogation in favor of SDBF. Then there's a list of insurance policies the Sponsor must obtain and maintain. \n\nLooking at the insurance policies mentioned: Workers' Compensation and Commercial General Liability. The Sponsor is required to get these and maintain them. The Commercial General Liability policy specifically needs to name SDBF, Padres LP, the City of San Diego, and their subsidiaries as Additional Insureds. That means these parties are covered under the Sponsor's insurance, which is for their benefit. \n\nAlso, the Sponsor has to provide certificates of insurance to SDBF before the sponsorship starts and annually. This shows that the insurance is maintained for SDBF's benefit, ensuring they're protected under the policies. \n\nAdditionally, there's a part about the Annual Payment exceeding $500,000 requiring approval from Noteholders. But that's more about contractual obligations rather than insurance. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the Sponsor must maintain certain insurance policies (like Commercial General Liability) that include SDBF and others as Additional Insureds. This directly benefits the counterparty (SDBF) by providing them coverage under the Sponsor's policies. Therefore, the answer should confirm that yes, there is such a requirement, specifically the Commercial General Liability Insurance with Additional Insureds.\n</think>\n\nYes, the Sponsor is required to maintain insurance policies for the benefit of the counterparty (SDBF) and related entities. Specifically, the Sponsor must obtain and maintain an **Insurance Services Office (ISO) occurrence-based Commercial General Liability Insurance Policy** with minimum limits, naming **SDBF, Padres LP, the City of San Diego, and their subsidiaries/affiliates** as **Additional Insureds** under the policy. This ensures coverage for these parties under the Sponsor\u2019s liability insurance.

The user is asking about the renewal term after the initial term of the agreement expires, including any automatic extensions or unilateral extensions that require prior notice.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context for any mention of renewal terms. The context includes several sections of the agreement. Let me go through each relevant part.\n\nLooking at section 10: The agreement is in effect until March 18, 2021, unless terminated by either party with 30 days written notice. There's no mention of automatic renewal here. The termination clause allows either party to end the agreement before the end date, but that's about termination, not renewal.\n\nSection 11 talks about what happens upon termination, like the Distributor receiving orders accepted before termination. Still nothing about renewal.\n\nOther sections mention things like handling competitive products, licenses, and communication methods. Section 12 says that after termination, neither party can contest it. There's also a part about assignment requiring consent and governing law in Texas.\n\nNowhere in the provided context do I see any language about the agreement renewing automatically after the initial term. The initial term ends on March 18, 2021, and if neither party terminates it, does it just end? The context doesn't mention any automatic extension beyond that date. Also, there's no mention of either party having the right to unilaterally extend the agreement with notice. The termination clause allows for ending it with 30 days notice, but that's during the term, not after.\n\nSo based on the information given, there's no indication that the agreement renews automatically or that there's a unilateral extension option.

      "ground_truth_answer": "No, the contract does not contain a license grant to a licensee or the affiliates of such licensee. The contract grants Distributor (GLS LLC) a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use and sublicense the Software provided by Airspan, but it does not explicitly grant a license or rights to any affiliates of the Distributor.\n\nSpecifically, Section 11.1 states:\n\n\"Airspan grants Distributor, and Distributor hereby accepts, a nonexclusive, non-transferable license to use, and to sublicense as set forth below, Software provided by Airspan hereunder only on a single System or unit of Equipment, as may be applicable.\"\n\nThere is no mention of affiliates of the Distributor being granted any license or rights to the Software.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the contract contains a license grant to a licensee, including their affiliates. I need to check the provided context for any mention of licensing.\n\nLooking through the context, there's a section about ordering procedures. In 4.1, the Distributor is supposed to send a written order for Equipment, Installation Services, and Software. The Contract Price includes the fee for licensing the Software. So, the Distributor is licensing the Software from Airspan. \n\nThen, in 3.10, it says the Distributor can't promote or sell outside the Territory without approval, but can respond to unsolicited requests. That implies that the Distributor might be sublicensing, but only with Airspan's consent. Also, 3.11 mentions not representing competitors, which is about exclusivity. \n\nThe Contract Price section (6.1) lists the licensing fee as part of the Contract Price. So the license is granted to the Distributor. The question is about whether the license includes affiliates of the licensee/sublicensor. The context doesn't explicitly mention affiliates of the Distributor being granted a license. The Distributor's obligations are their own, and there's no mention of their affiliates getting a license unless they are part of the Distributor's controlled entities. \n\nIn 3.11, it says the Distributor and any controlled entities can't represent competitors without consent. But that's about exclusivity, not licensing. The license grant is to the Distributor, not their affiliates. Unless the Distributor is allowed to sublicense, which would be under 3.10, but only with Airspan's prior written approval. So, if the Distributor gets approval, they can sublicense, but the original license is just to them. The question is about whether the contract includes a license to the licensee (Distributor) and their affiliates. The answer would be that the license is granted to the Distributor, and sublicensing to affiliates would require Airspan's approval. Therefore, the contract does include a license grant to the Distributor (the licensee) but not automatically to their affiliates unless they are part of the Distributor's controlled entities and have permission.\n</think>\n\nThe contract contains a license grant to the **Distributor (the licensee)** for the Software, as outlined in the **Contract Price** section (6.1b), which explicitly includes \"the fee for the licensing of the Software.\"",

Representations, Warranties and Covenants of the Remarketing Agent and the Fund.\" The word \"Supplement\" is defined in the preamble, but the exact name of the contract isn't directly stated here. \n\nFurther down, there's a line that says \"333-226136 and No. 811-09475), relating to the MFP Shares and other securities of the Fund, declared effective by order of the Commission on October [\u25cf], 2018...\" These numbers look like registration numbers under the Securities Act, but that's not the contract name.\n\nLooking at the sections listed at the end, like \"Section 22. Amendment 15\", \"Section 23. Benefits 15\", etc., it seems like the document is structured with various sections. The title of the contract might be mentioned in the preamble or in the section titles. However, the user's context doesn't include the actual title. \n\nWait, the context mentions \"Remarketing Agent Not Acting as Underwriter 15 Section 22...\" and other sections. The sections are numbered up to 26. The contract might be called something like \"Remarketing Agreement\" since there's a mention of \"Termination of Remarketing Agreement\" in Section 10. \n\nAlso, in the context, there's a part that says \"Section 3. Representations, Warranties and Covenants of the Remarketing Agent and the Fund.\" This suggests that the contract involves the Remarketing Agent and the Fund. The term \"Remarketing Agreement\" is used in Section 10's mention: \"Section 10. Termination of Remarketing Agreement 12 Section 11.\"",

      "question": "Is a party subject to obligations after the termination or expiration of a contract, including any post-termination transition, payment, transfer of IP, wind-down, last-buy, or similar commitments?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, based on the information provided in the agreement, there are certain obligations that continue after the termination or expiration of the contract:\n\n1. The provisions of Sections 3.6, 4, 6, 8, 9 and 11 shall survive any termination of the agreement (Section 10.8).\n\n2. Any contract entered into by the Parties with a Marketer for the Product shall survive termination of the agreement in accordance with its terms, including any renewal rights provided therein (Section 10.1). \n\n3. Upon any breach by CAPSUGEL, CARDAX shall be permitted to use all Intellectual Property of CAPSUGEL used in the Formulation and the Product to the extent necessary for the development and marketing of the Product (Section 10.2).\n\n4. Upon any breach by CARDAX, CAPSUGEL shall be permitted to use all Intellectual Property of CARDAX used in the Active Ingredient and the Product to the extent necessary for the development and marketing of the Product in accordance with the terms of the agreement as of the date of such termination (Section 10.2).\n\n5. Each Party shall return to the other Party or to the other Party's designee no later than thirty (30) days after the effective date of termination all of such other Party's property, including all proprietary information, in its possession, except to the extent required to be retained by law or to comply with such Party's continuing obligations (Section 10.7).\n\nSo in summary, yes there are certain post-termination obligations, including the survival of certain provisions, the continuing effect of third-party contracts, and the return of proprietary information and materials.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether a party has obligations after the termination or expiration of a contract, including things like transition, payments, IP transfer, wind-down, etc. The context provided is from a contract's Term and Termination section, specifically Sections 10.1 to 10.8 and some parts of Section 11.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the given context for any mentions of post-termination obligations. Let's start with Section 10.7 Property. It says that upon termination, each party must return the other's property, including proprietary information, within 30 days, except what's required by law or to meet continuing obligations. So that's a clear post-termination obligation regarding returning property.\n\nThen, in Section 10.8 Survival, it mentions that certain sections (3.6, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11) survive termination. This means those sections' terms remain in effect even after the contract ends. For example, Section 6 includes things like Regulatory Notices and Recordkeeping, which might involve ongoing obligations. Also, Section 11 is Miscellaneous, which includes Dispute Resolution (11.1), so that's another surviving obligation.\n\nLooking at 10.2 Termination for Breach: If there's a material breach not cured, the contract can be terminated. But if the breaching party is trying to fix it in good faith, the cure period is extended. Also, upon breach by either party, the non-breaching party can use the other's IP for development and marketing. This implies that IP usage rights might continue post-termination under certain conditions.\n\nSection 10.1 mentions that contracts with Marketers survive termination according to their terms. So any renewal rights or obligations under those marketer contracts would still apply after the main agreement ends.\n\nAdditionally, in the context provided, there's a mention of Royalty Payments in 6.4 and audit costs if the royalty is 10% higher than reported. Even though this is under Section 6, since Section 6 is listed as surviving in 10.8, those payment obligations might still be in effect post-termination.\n\nAlso, the Confidentiality section (Section 9) is governed by a separate agreement from Nov 19, 2013. So confidentiality obligations would continue as per that agreement even after",

After termination or expiration of the franchise agreement, the franchisee and its owners agree not to have any direct or indirect interest in a Competitive Business located at the franchise site, within 3 miles of the franchise unit, or within 3 miles of any other Pretzel Time unit in operation or under development for a period of 12 months (Section 20.G).\n\nThe agreement also restricts the franchisee from recruiting or hiring any employees who were employed by Pretzel Time or another Pretzel Time franchisee within the prior 6 months, without Pretzel Time's prior written permission (Section 21.A(2)).\n\nSo in summary, the franchise agreement imposes non-compete and non-solicitation restrictions on the franchisee both during the contract term and for a period after the contract ends.",

However, the rest of the context doesn't explicitly mention restrictions on soliciting customers or partners. \n\nThere are sections about Confidential Information (20.F) where the Franchisee must stop using it after termination. Also, the Third Party Assignment Agreement part mentions Pretzel Time isn't responsible for certain charges.

There's no specific mention of restrictions on customers or partners. So based on the given context, the answer would be that there's no such restriction mentioned. The non-compete is mentioned but not enforceable, but that's about competition, not solicitation.
