      "question": "Is a party\u2019s liability uncapped upon the breach of its obligation in the contract? This also includes uncap liability for a particular type of breach such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality obligation.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the context provided in the Cooperation Agreement, there does not appear to be any uncapped liability for a party's breach of the contract. The agreement does not explicitly state that a party's liability is uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.\n\nThe relevant sections are:\n\n1. Clause 5 on Confidential Information, which states that the obligations of confidentiality shall remain in force until the relevant information enters the public domain otherwise than by the default of a party. This suggests there is no uncapped liability for breach of the confidentiality obligation.\n\n2. Clause 4.1 regarding QIWI's obligation to settle transactions through Otkritie's bank. This clause states that if QIWI terminates this obligation, it shall pay a fee to Otkritie, but this fee is capped at RUB 50,000,000. This indicates a cap on liability for breach of this specific obligation.\n\n3. The agreement does not contain any other provisions that suggest uncapped liability for breach of the contract or specific types of breaches. The dispute resolution clause (Clause 9) also does not indicate uncapped damages.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the Cooperation Agreement, the liability of the parties does not appear to be uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether a party's liability is uncapped in the event of a breach of the contract, including specific breaches like IP infringement or confidentiality. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context to see if there's any mention of liability caps or exclusions. The context includes several clauses, especially around governing law, dispute resolution, confidentiality, and specific obligations like the one in Clause 4.1.\n\nStarting with the confidentiality section (Clause 5.1 and 5.2), there's an obligation to keep information confidential, but there's no mention of a cap on liability for breaching that. Similarly, in Clause 4.1, there's a financial obligation if QIWI terminates the obligation early, with a maximum fee of 50 million rubles. That seems like a cap for that specific breach. However, the question is about whether liability is uncapped in general, including for IP or confidentiality breaches.\n\nLooking through the entire document, I don't see any clause that explicitly limits liability for all breaches. The only cap mentioned is in Clause 4.1 for the termination fee. Other breaches, like confidentiality, don't have a stated cap. The governing law is English law, which typically doesn't cap liability unless specified in the contract. Since the contract doesn't mention a general liability cap, the default would be that liability is uncapped unless there's an exclusion or limitation clause.\n\nAlso, in the confidentiality clauses (5.1-5.4), there's no mention of a cap on damages for breach. So, unless there's a specific exclusion (which there isn't), the liability for confidentiality breaches would be uncapped. The same applies to other breaches unless specified otherwise. Therefore, the answer would be that liability is generally uncapped unless a specific clause provides a cap, like the 50 million ruble limit in Clause 4.1.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: The parties' liability is **not uncapped** in all circumstances. The contract includes specific caps for certain breaches. For example, Clause 4.1 explicitly limits QIWI's liability for terminating its obligation to a maximum fee of **RUB 50,000,000** (fifty million roubles). However, for other breaches (e.g., confidentiality obligations in Clause 5.1 or IP infringement), the context does **not specify liability caps**, implying",

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if there's a requirement for insurance that one party must maintain for the benefit of the counterparty. The context provided is about insurance policies that the Sponsor must have.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the context. The main points are:\n\n- All insurance policies must be issued by an admitted carrier with an A.M. Indemnity, etc.\n- If there's cancellation, non-renewal, or material modification, SDBF gets 30 days notice.\n- The Sponsor must provide certificates of insurance to SDBF before the sponsorship starts and annually before each policy expires.\n- The Sponsor must obtain and maintain at their own expense certain insurance policies, specifically a Commercial General Liability Insurance Policy with specific coverage and limits.\n\nThe question is about whether there's a requirement for insurance maintained by one party for the counterparty's benefit. In this case, the Sponsor is the one getting the insurance, and SDBF is the counterparty. The Sponsor has to maintain the insurance, provide proof, and notify SDBF of any changes. The insurance is for the benefit of SDBF because it's part of the sponsorship agreement. The Sponsor's obligation is to ensure that SDBF is covered under these policies, which would protect SDBF in case of claims related to the Sponsor's activities. \n\nSo yes, the Sponsor is required to maintain insurance for SDBF's benefit. The key points are the Sponsor's obligation to maintain the insurance, provide certificates, and notify SDBF, which all indicate that the insurance is for SDBF's benefit. The answer should confirm this requirement exists based on the context.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: Yes, the Sponsor is required to obtain and continuously maintain specific insurance policies (e.g., Commercial General Liability Insurance) at their own expense for the benefit of SDBF. These policies must be issued by an admitted insurance carrier, include specified coverage limits, and compliance must be evidenced through certificates provided to SDBF. Additionally, the Sponsor must notify SDBF 30 days in advance of any cancellation, non-renewal, or material modification of these policies.

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out the answer to the question \"The name of the contract\" based on the provided context. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the context is about. The context seems to be a legal document, possibly related to a company's stock offering or merger. There are mentions of the Company, MHC (maybe a holding company?), the Bank, and various legal clauses. The sections (i), (j), (xv), (xvi), etc., suggest that this is a detailed contractual agreement with multiple clauses.\n\nThe question is asking for the name of the contract. The user wants me to extract the actual name of the contract from the context provided. Let me scan through the text for any mention of the contract's name.\n\nLooking at the beginning, there's a mention of \"the Company, the MHC and the Bank will not sell or issue...\" and later in (j) \"the Company shall register its Common Stock under Section 12(g)...\". Then in (xvii) it says \"The Plan complies in all material respects...\" which might refer to a Plan. Also, in (t) there's a reference to \"the Plan and in the Prospectus\".\n\nWait, in (j) it says \"pursuant to the Plan and shall request...\" and in (xvii) \"except that no opinion is rendered with respect to (a) the MHC Application, the Registration Statement or Prospectus, which are covered by other clauses of this opinion...\" So there's a Plan, MHC Application, Registration Statement, Prospectus. \n\nLooking at (t) again: \"the Shares will have been duly and validly authorized for issuance and, when issued and delivered by the Company pursuant to the Plan...\" So the Plan is mentioned multiple times. Also, in (xvii) \"The Plan complies in all material respects with all applicable federal laws...\" So the Plan is a key document here.\n\nBut the question is about the name of the contract. The context is part of a larger agreement, perhaps called \"the Agreement\"? Let me check. In (r): \"the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement...\" So \"this Agreement\" is mentioned. Also in (s): \"such agreements are in full force and effect\". \n\nLooking at the start of the context, the first line says \"The Company, the MHC and the Bank will not sell...\" which is",

The  description  in  the  MHC   Application,   the                Registration  Statement and the  Prospectus of such documents and                exhibits is accurate in all material respects and fairly presents                the information required to be shown.

The Plan complies in all material  respects with all                applicable federal laws, rules, regulations, decisions and orders                including, but not limited to, the MHC Regulations;  no order has                been issued by the OTS, the  Commission,  the FDIC,  or any state                authority to suspend the  Offering or the use of the  Prospectus,                and no action for such purposes has been  instituted  or, to such                counsel's   Actual   Knowledge,   threatened   by  the  OTS,  the                Commission,  the FDIC,  or any state  authority and no person has                sought  to  obtain  regulatory  or  judicial  review of the final                action of the OTS, approving the Plan, the MHC Application or the                Prospectus.

      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, based on the information provided in the agreement, there are certain obligations that continue after the termination or expiration of the contract:\n\n1. The provisions of Sections 3.6, 4, 6, 8, 9 and 11 shall survive any termination of the agreement (Section 10.8).\n\n2. Any contract entered into by the Parties with a Marketer for the Product shall survive termination of the agreement in accordance with its terms, including any renewal rights provided therein (Section 10.1). \n\n3. Upon any breach by CAPSUGEL, CARDAX shall be permitted to use all Intellectual Property of CAPSUGEL used in the Formulation and the Product to the extent necessary for the development and marketing of the Product (Section 10.2).\n\n4. Upon any breach by CARDAX, CAPSUGEL shall be permitted to use all Intellectual Property of CARDAX used in the Active Ingredient and the Product to the extent necessary for the development and marketing of the Product in accordance with the terms of the agreement as of the date of such termination (Section 10.2).\n\n5. Each Party shall return to the other Party or to the other Party's designee no later than thirty (30) days after the effective date of termination all of such other Party's property, including all proprietary information, in its possession, except to the extent required to be retained by law or to comply with such Party's continuing obligations (Section 10.7).\n\nSo in summary, yes there are certain post-termination obligations, including the survival of certain provisions, the continuing effect of third-party contracts, and the return of proprietary information and materials.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether a party has obligations after the termination or expiration of a contract, including things like transition, payments, IP transfer, wind-down, last-buy, etc. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the provided context. The context includes parts of a contract, specifically sections about term, termination, and obligations. Let me go through each relevant part.\n\nStarting with the first sentence in the context: CAPSUGEL must retain records for 5 years after the agreement ends. That's a post-termination obligation related to record retention. \n\nLooking at Section 10.1 Term and Termination. It mentions that contracts with a Marketer survive termination according to their own terms. Also, each party must return the other's property within 30 days, except what's required by law or for continuing obligations. So returning property is a post-termination obligation. \n\nSection 10.2 Termination for Breach: If there's a material breach not cured within a certain period, the agreement can be terminated. But if the breaching party is diligently working to fix it, there's an extension. This relates to obligations during the cure period after termination notice.\n\nThen there's a part about maintaining product liability insurance for 2 years after termination or expiry of the last batch. That's another post-termination obligation.\n\nThe question is about whether there are obligations after termination. The answer seems to be yes, based on several points: returning property, retaining records, maintaining insurance, and handling contracts with marketers. Also, the mention of \"continuing obligations\" in the context implies that some duties persist after termination. \n\nI need to check if the context covers all the areas mentioned in the question: transition, payments, IP transfer, etc. The context specifically mentions returning property (which could include IP), retaining records, insurance, and survival of marketer contracts. Payments aren't directly mentioned here, but the question is whether there are obligations, and the answer is yes. The answer should list the examples from the context like returning property, record retention, insurance, and survival of other contracts. \n\nSo the answer should confirm that yes, there are post-termination obligations, citing the specific examples from the sections provided.\n</think>\n\nYes, a party is subject to obligations after the termination or expiration of the contract. The context outlines several post-termination commitments, including:  \n1. **Returning property**: Each party must",

During the term of the franchise agreement, the franchisee agrees that neither it, its affiliates, nor its owners will have any direct or indirect interest in a \"Competitive Business\" located at the franchise site, within 3 miles of the franchise unit, or within 3 miles of any other Pretzel Time unit in operation or under development (Section 21.A).\n\n2. After termination or expiration of the franchise agreement, the franchisee and its owners agree not to have any direct or indirect interest in a Competitive Business located at the franchise site, within 3 miles of the franchise unit, or within 3 miles of any other Pretzel Time unit in operation or under development for a period of 12 months (Section 20.G).\n\nThe agreement also restricts the franchisee from recruiting or hiring any employees who were employed by Pretzel Time or another Pretzel Time franchisee within the prior 6 months, without Pretzel Time's prior written permission (Section 21.A(2)).\n\nSo in summary, the franchise agreement imposes non-compete and non-solicitation restrictions on the franchisee both during the contract term and for a period after the contract ends.",

The user is asking whether a party is restricted from contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty during or after the contract ends. I need to check the provided context for any clauses related to non-solicitation or non-compete.\n\nLooking through the context first. The first part is about waiving a jury trial. Then there's a section about agreements needing to be in writing. Next, there's something about notice periods and delivery methods. Then it mentions interview personnel and customers of the Unit, but that seems like part of some other clause, maybe about inspections or something. \n\nFurther down, there's a section about termination or expiration of the agreement. It says that upon termination, the Franchisee must pay fees and that termination doesn't affect existing debts. But I don't see any mention of non-solicitation or non-compete clauses here. The context provided doesn't include specific language about restricting either party from soliciting customers or partners during or after the contract. \n\nThe question is about whether such restrictions exist. Since the context doesn't have any clauses that explicitly prohibit solicitation, either during or after the contract, the answer would be that there's no such restriction mentioned here.
