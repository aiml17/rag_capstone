      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking about the duration of any warranty against defects or errors in technology, products, or services provided under the contract.

The amendment is to Section 2, Part B, which is titled \"Term.\" The agreement was signed by both parties with dates December 5, 1996, and December 12, 1996.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the provided context mentions anything about warranties. The context provided is the amendment to the Term section. The Term section usually refers to the duration of the contract, not the warranty. The user is asking about warranties against defects or errors, which is a different section. The context here doesn't include any information about warranties. The amendment is about the term, so it's about how long the contract lasts, not about warranties. Since there's no mention of warranties in the given context, the answer would be that the information isn't provided here. The user might need to look at other parts of the Co-Branding Agreement that deal with warranties, but based on the provided text, there's no data to answer the question.\n</think>\n\nThe provided context focuses on an amendment to the \"Term\" section of the Co-Branding Agreement, specifying the duration of the contract itself (effective December 9, 1996).

      "question": "Is a party\u2019s liability uncapped upon the breach of its obligation in the contract? This also includes uncap liability for a particular type of breach such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality obligation.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the context provided in the Cooperation Agreement, there does not appear to be any uncapped liability for a party's breach of the contract. The agreement does not explicitly state that a party's liability is uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.\n\nThe relevant sections are:\n\n1. Clause 5 on Confidential Information, which states that the obligations of confidentiality shall remain in force until the relevant information enters the public domain otherwise than by the default of a party. This suggests there is no uncapped liability for breach of the confidentiality obligation.\n\n2. Clause 4.1 regarding QIWI's obligation to settle transactions through Otkritie's bank. This clause states that if QIWI terminates this obligation, it shall pay a fee to Otkritie, but this fee is capped at RUB 50,000,000. This indicates a cap on liability for breach of this specific obligation.\n\n3. The agreement does not contain any other provisions that suggest uncapped liability for breach of the contract or specific types of breaches. The dispute resolution clause (Clause 9) also does not indicate uncapped damages.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the Cooperation Agreement, the liability of the parties does not appear to be uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether a party's liability is uncapped in case of a breach of their obligations under the contract, specifically mentioning IP infringement and confidentiality breaches.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context to see if there's any mention of liability caps or limitations. The context includes several clauses from the agreement between Otkritie and QIWI. Let me go through each relevant section.\n\nLooking at the context, the main sections are 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 7.1-7.3. The question is about liability, so I should check if there's a liability clause. The context provided doesn't include a specific section about liability limits. The sections mentioned are about the Steering Committee's decisions not being binding without approval, areas of cooperation, and general miscellaneous terms like no partnership and variations needing written agreement.\n\nThe user is asking if liability is uncapped. In many contracts, especially in business agreements, there are often clauses that limit liability, especially for certain types of breaches. However, in the absence of any mention of liability caps in the provided context, the default would be that liability isn't capped unless specified. The context here doesn't have any language about limiting liability for breaches, including IP or confidentiality. \n\nAlso, section 7.1 mentions that nothing in the agreement makes them partners or allows them to bind third parties, but that's not directly related to liability caps. Section 7.2 talks about void provisions and replacements, and 7.3 requires written variations. None of these address liability limits.\n\nSince there's no mention of liability being capped in the provided text, the answer would be that the liability isn't capped as per the given context. However, it's possible that other parts of the full contract (not included here) might have such clauses. But based solely on the provided information, there's no indication of liability caps.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: The provided context does not specify whether a party\u2019s liability is capped or uncapped upon breach of obligations, including for IP infringement or confidentiality breaches. The agreement emphasizes that Steering Committee decisions are non-binding without approval by both parties\u2019 governing bodies (Clause 3.6\u20133.9) and includes general terms about no partnership (Clause 7.1), severability (Clause 7.2), and written variations (Clause 7.3).",

The user is asking about the renewal term after the initial term expires, including any automatic extensions or unilateral extensions with prior notice.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context for information about the agreement's duration and renewal. The context mentions in section 10 that the Agreement is in effect until March 18, 2021, and that either party can terminate it with 30 days written notice without cause.

The contract grants Distributor (GLS LLC) a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use and sublicense the Software provided by Airspan, but it does not explicitly grant a license or rights to any affiliates of the Distributor.\n\nSpecifically, Section 11.1 states:\n\n\"Airspan grants Distributor, and Distributor hereby accepts, a nonexclusive, non-transferable license to use, and to sublicense as set forth below, Software provided by Airspan hereunder only on a single System or unit of Equipment, as may be applicable.\"\n\nThere is no mention of affiliates of the Distributor being granted any license or rights to the Software.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the contract contains a license grant to a licensee, including their affiliates. I need to check the provided context for any mention of licensing.\n\nLooking through the sections, 3.8 talks about maintenance staff and not subcontracting without authorization. 3.9 mentions facilities and support functions. 3.10 is about not promoting products outside the territory without approval. Then there's a part about Airspan notifying the Distributor of claims and allowing them to conduct defense. \n\nSection 16.6 requires the Distributor to include clauses in customer agreements that protect Airspan from liability. Then Section 17 is about indemnity for intellectual property. 17.1 says Airspan indemnifies the Distributor against third-party claims of infringement. There's a part about returning equipment and getting a refund. \n\nSection 18 mentions liability for physical damage up to $1M. Also, 16.4 and 16.5 discuss liability for death or injury. \n\nNowhere in the provided context do I see a direct grant of a license to the Distributor or their affiliates. The Distributor is required to maintain and support the products, but there's no mention of a license grant. The term \"license\" appears in 3.8 (\"license by Distributor from Airspan\") but that's about the Distributor purchasing or licensing products from Airspan, not granting a license to others. \n\nThe question is about whether the contract includes a license grant to the licensee (Distributor) and their affiliates. The context doesn't specify that Airspan grants a license to the Distributor to sublicense or to their affiliates. Section 3.10 mentions that the Distributor can't promote products outside the territory without approval, but selling to customers outside in response to unsolicited requests is allowed. However, that's about distribution, not licensing. \n\nAlso, in 17.1, it's about the use of Equipment or Software by Distributor, implying that the Distributor has some rights to use, but again, not explicitly a license grant. The indemnity in 17.1 is for the Distributor's use, which might imply a license, but the question is about the contract containing a license grant. Since the context doesn't have a specific section stating that Airspan grants a license to the Distributor and their affiliates, the answer would be no.\n</think>",

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of the contract based on the provided context. Let me look through the sections mentioned.\n\nThe context starts with Section 3 about the Prospectus and Offering, then moves to Section 4 with Representations and Warranties of the Company, the MHC, and the Bank. There's also mention of termination in Section 4(c) if the Agent elects to terminate. Then there's Section 12 about Notices, Section 17 about Counterparts, and Section 18. \n\nLooking at the structure, the document seems to be an agreement between the Company, the MHC, the Bank, and the Agent. The sections cover various aspects like the offering of shares, representations, termination clauses, and execution in counterparts. \n\nThe key part might be in the last paragraph where it says, \"If the foregoing correctly sets forth the arrangement among the Company, the MHC, the Bank and the Agent, please indicate acceptance thereof...\" This suggests that the document is a formal agreement. The sections listed are parts of a larger contract. \n\nSince the sections include terms like \"Representations and Warranties,\" \"Termination,\" \"Notices,\" and \"Counterparts,\" which are common in underwriting agreements or securities offering agreements. Also, the mention of a Prospectus and Shares being offered points towards a securities offering. \n\nIn the financial industry, when a company issues shares, they often have an underwriting agreement with an agent or underwriter. The sections here talk about the Agent's role, termination by the Agent, and the Company's obligations. \n\nLooking at the specific sections again, Section 4(c) mentions the Agent terminating the Agreement. The parties involved are the Company, MHC (which could be a Mutual Holding Company), the Bank, and the Agent. \n\nPutting it all together, the contract is likely an Underwriting Agreement. Underwriting agreements typically outline the terms between the issuing company and the underwriter (Agent here) regarding the sale of securities. The sections about termination, representations, and the Prospectus align with what's found in underwriting agreements. \n\nAnother possibility is a Securities Purchase Agreement, but the mention of an Agent and the structure of the sections (like termination clauses related to the Agent's breach) leans more towards an underwriting agreement. Also, the reference to the Prospectus and the Offering supports this, as underwriters are involved in such offerings.",

The user is asking whether a party is subject to obligations after the termination or expiration of a contract, including things like post-termination transition, payments, IP transfer, wind-down, last-buy, etc.\n\nLooking at the provided context, the main sections are about termination and representations/warranties. The context includes sections 10.5 and 10.6, which are about termination for force majeure and no waiver. Then there's Section 7.1 about representations and warranties from CAPSUGEL.

There's no section that talks about post-termination obligations, IP transfer, payments, or wind-down. The termination clauses here (like 10.5) talk about when a party can terminate due to force majeure, but not the consequences after termination. The answer would depend on whether the original contract has other sections that handle post-termination matters.

      "question": "Is a party restricted from contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty, whether during the contract or after the contract ends (or both)?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, the franchise agreement contains restrictions on the franchisee's ability to compete with Pretzel Time, both during the term of the franchise agreement and after its termination or expiration.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n1. During the term of the franchise agreement, the franchisee agrees that neither it, its affiliates, nor its owners will have any direct or indirect interest in a \"Competitive Business\" located at the franchise site, within 3 miles of the franchise unit, or within 3 miles of any other Pretzel Time unit in operation or under development (Section 21.A).\n\n2. After termination or expiration of the franchise agreement, the franchisee and its owners agree not to have any direct or indirect interest in a Competitive Business located at the franchise site, within 3 miles of the franchise unit, or within 3 miles of any other Pretzel Time unit in operation or under development for a period of 12 months (Section 20.G).\n\nThe agreement also restricts the franchisee from recruiting or hiring any employees who were employed by Pretzel Time or another Pretzel Time franchisee within the prior 6 months, without Pretzel Time's prior written permission (Section 21.A(2)).\n\nSo in summary, the franchise agreement imposes non-compete and non-solicitation restrictions on the franchisee both during the contract term and for a period after the contract ends.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether a party is restricted from contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty, both during the contract and after it ends. The context provided is from a franchise agreement, specifically the Covenant Not to Compete section.\n\nFirst, I need to check the context thoroughly. The Covenant Not to Compete section (20.G) talks about restrictions after termination or expiration of the agreement. It mentions that for 12 months after termination, the Franchisee and its Owners can't have any interest in a Competitive Business located at the Site, within 3 miles of the Unit, or within 3 miles of any other Pretzel Time Unit. The restrictions apply to various roles like owner, investor, partner, director, etc. However, it also excludes owning shares of a publicly traded company if it's 2% or less.\n\nBut the question is about soliciting customers or partners. The context doesn't explicitly mention anything about solicitation. The Covenant Not to Compete focuses on not engaging in a competitive business in certain areas, but there's no direct mention of restrictions on contacting customers or partners. \n\nLooking through the definitions, \"Competitive Business\" is defined as a business offering similar products or granting franchises. However, the non-compete clause here is about ownership or involvement in such businesses, not about soliciting customers. \n\nThe user's question is about whether there's a restriction on contracting or soliciting customers or partners. Since the provided context doesn't include a non-solicitation clause, the answer would be that the Covenant Not to Compete doesn't cover that. The restrictions are about ownership and involvement in competitive businesses, not about solicitation activities. Unless there's another section in the agreement that addresses non-solicitation, which isn't provided here, the answer would be no.\n</think>\n\nThe provided context does not explicitly restrict a party from contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty during or after the contract. The **Covenant Not to Compete** (Section 20.G) focuses on prohibiting the Franchisee and its affiliates from owning or participating in a **Competitive Business** within specified geographic areas for 12 months post-termination or expiration. However, it does not address restrictions on **soliciting customers, partners, or employees** directly. \n\nThe definitions and terms in the context emphasize ownership, control, or involvement in competitive ventures but do not mention",

        "Franchisee acknowledges and agrees that Pretzel Time would be unable to protect  Confidential  Information  against  unauthorized  use or disclosure and would be unable to  encourage  a free  exchange of ideas and  information  among Pretzel Time Units if  Franchisees  of Pretzel Time Units were permitted to hold interests in or perform services for a Competitive  Business except as specified in Exhibit C.

The amendment is about Section 2, Part B, which is titled \"Term.\" The document mentions that this amendment applies to both companies and their subsidiaries. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what an exclusive dealing commitment entails. It usually means that one party agrees to buy all their needs from the other, or not to deal with others. The question is whether there's a requirement to procure all requirements from one party or prohibitions on working with third parties.\n\nLooking at the provided text, the main content is the amendment to the Term section. The Term section typically deals with the duration of the agreement, when it starts, ends, and any renewal terms. The amendment is effective December 9, 1996, and the parties are PCQ and ABW. The document includes signatures from both companies with dates in December 1996. \n\nThe key part here is that the amendment is about the Term. There's no mention of exclusivity in the text provided. The Term section would cover how long the agreement lasts, not about exclusivity in procurement or restrictions on dealing with others. The absence of any language like \"exclusive,\" \"all requirements,\" \"prohibition on licensing,\" or \"prohibition on collaborating with others\" suggests that there's no exclusive dealing commitment here. \n\nAdditionally, the sources cited are from an S-1/A filing, which is a registration statement for an IPO. Such filings often include various agreements but unless there's specific language about exclusivity, it's unlikely to be present here. Since the user's context is limited to this amendment, and the amendment only refers to the Term section, there's no indication of exclusive dealing terms. \n\nTherefore, based on the provided information, the answer should be that there is no exclusive dealing commitment mentioned in the context given.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: No, the provided context does not indicate an exclusive dealing commitment.
