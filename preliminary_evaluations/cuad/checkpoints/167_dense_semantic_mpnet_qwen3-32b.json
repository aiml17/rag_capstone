The only sections mentioned are the Term (Section 2) and the Co-Branding Agreement. \n\nSince the context only provides the amendment to the Term section and there's no mention of warranties, there's no information here about the duration of warranties.

      "question": "Is a party\u2019s liability uncapped upon the breach of its obligation in the contract? This also includes uncap liability for a particular type of breach such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality obligation.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the context provided in the Cooperation Agreement, there does not appear to be any uncapped liability for a party's breach of the contract. The agreement does not explicitly state that a party's liability is uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.\n\nThe relevant sections are:\n\n1. Clause 5 on Confidential Information, which states that the obligations of confidentiality shall remain in force until the relevant information enters the public domain otherwise than by the default of a party. This suggests there is no uncapped liability for breach of the confidentiality obligation.\n\n2. Clause 4.1 regarding QIWI's obligation to settle transactions through Otkritie's bank. This clause states that if QIWI terminates this obligation, it shall pay a fee to Otkritie, but this fee is capped at RUB 50,000,000. This indicates a cap on liability for breach of this specific obligation.\n\n3. The agreement does not contain any other provisions that suggest uncapped liability for breach of the contract or specific types of breaches. The dispute resolution clause (Clause 9) also does not indicate uncapped damages.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the Cooperation Agreement, the liability of the parties does not appear to be uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether a party's liability is uncapped if they breach the contract, especially for things like IP infringement or confidentiality breaches. The context provided is a contract clause, so I need to check if there's any mention of liability caps or exclusions.\n\nLooking through the clauses given: 7.5 and 7.6 talk about assignment and third-party rights. Then 7.1 and 7.2 are about partnership and enforceability. Clauses 5.1 to 5.4 are about confidentiality. There's no mention of liability limits or exclusions for breaches. The confidentiality clauses outline obligations and exceptions but don't specify that liability is capped. \n\nSo, if there's no clause that limits liability, the default would be that liability isn't capped. The answer should be that the liability isn't uncapped because the contract doesn't include any provisions that limit liability for breaches. Therefore, the parties would be liable without a cap unless there's an applicable law that limits it. But since the question is about the contract's terms, the answer is yes, liability is uncapped.\n</think>\n\nThe provided context does not include any explicit provisions limiting or capping a party's liability for breaches of the contract, including specific breaches like IP infringement or confidentiality violations. Clauses 5.1\u20135.4 outline confidentiality obligations and permitted disclosures but do not address liability caps. Similarly, other clauses (e.g., 7.1\u20137.6) focus on assignment, third-party rights, and partnership issues but remain silent on liability limitations. \n\nIn the absence of a contractual cap on liability, the default legal principle applies: parties are generally liable for damages arising from breaches unless explicitly excluded or limited by the contract. Therefore, **a party\u2019s liability for breach (including IP infringement or confidentiality breaches) is not capped under the terms of this agreement**. Any liability limitations would depend on applicable law or additional clauses not included in the provided context.",

      "question": "Is there a requirement for insurance that must be maintained by one party for the benefit of the counterparty?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, according to the General Provisions of the Sponsorship Agreement, the Sponsor (Rubio's Fresh Mexican Grill) must obtain and continuously maintain certain insurance policies for the benefit of the counterparty, SDBF (San Diego Ballpark Funding LLC):\n\nSpecifically, Section 8(c) states that Sponsor must obtain and continuously maintain the following insurance policies:\n\n1. Workers' Compensation insurance with minimum liability limits.\n\n2. An occurrence-based Commercial General Liability Insurance Policy with minimum liability limits.\n\nThe policies must name SDBF, Padres LP, the City of San Diego, and their subsidiary/affiliated companies and directors/officers/employees as Additional Insureds. The policies must also contain Cross Liability Endorsements and a Waiver of Subrogation in favor of SDBF.\n\nSponsor must provide SDBF with certificates of insurance evidencing compliance with these insurance requirements prior to the commencement of the sponsorship and annually prior to the expiration of each required insurance policy.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if there's a requirement for insurance that one party must maintain for the benefit of the counterparty. Let me look at the context provided.\n\nThe context says that all insurance policies must be issued by an admitted insurance carrier with an A.M. (probably A.M. Best, which rates insurers). The sponsor has to obtain and maintain certain insurance policies: Indemnity, Insurance, and Assumption of the Risk. Also, coverage for Additional Insureds must be primary regardless of other insurance. All policies need Cross Liability Endorsements or equivalents.\n\nSo, the key points here are that the sponsor is responsible for getting and keeping these insurances. The mention of Additional Insureds suggests that these policies are for the benefit of others, possibly the counterparty. Cross Liability Endorsements mean that if there's a claim, the policies work together, which is important when multiple parties are involved. The requirement for coverage to be primary means that the counterparty's own insurance isn't considered first, so the sponsor's insurance is the main coverage for them.\n\nTherefore, yes, the sponsor must maintain insurance (like Indemnity and others) that benefits the counterparty by including them as Additional Insureds. The Cross Liability Endorsements ensure that the policies cover each other, which is a form of protection for the counterparty. The answer should confirm this requirement exists based on the context.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: Yes, the context requires the sponsor to maintain insurance policies (e.g., Indemnity, Insurance, and Assumption of the Risk) that include coverage for \"Additional Insureds\" on a primary basis. This ensures the counterparty (or other specified parties) are protected under these policies, and the inclusion of Cross Liability Endorsements further clarifies that the policies must cover liabilities involving both parties.

The Distributor gets a license to resell Airspan Products in the Territory. But it also specifies that there's no transfer of rights, title, or interest in the Airspan Software. So the license here is specifically for reselling products, not for using the software. \n\nThen in section 21.3, there's a clause about assignment of the agreement. It mentions that if the assignment is to a subsidiary or affiliate, consent can't be unreasonably withheld. This might imply that the Distributor's affiliates could be involved, but it's about assigning the entire agreement, not a license grant. \n\nLooking at section 10.6: It states that nothing in the agreement grants the Distributor rights in Airspan's Confidential Information except for using it under the Agreement. So no license there. \n\nSection 3.1 talks about services the Distributor must perform, but there's no mention of licensing. \n\nAlso, in 1.2, the Distributor is an independent contractor with no authority to act on Airspan's behalf.

Let me look through the context carefully.\n\nFirst, the context starts with sections labeled (ii), (iii), etc., which seem to be parts of a legal document. Then there's a section labeled (g) mentioning a letter from The Accounting & Consulting Group L.L.P. Then there's a part titled \"Representations and Warranties of the Agent.\" Further down, there's a section titled \"Entire Agreement\" which refers to \"This Agreement,\" and mentions that it includes schedules and exhibits. \n\nLooking at the structure, the document is likely a legal agreement. The key part might be in the \"Entire Agreement\" section. The first sentence says, \"This Agreement, including schedules and exhibits hereto...\" which suggests that the formal name of the contract is \"Agreement.\" However, sometimes contracts have specific names, like \"Consulting Agreement\" or \"Service Agreement.\" \n\nBut in the context provided, there's a mention of a \"Letter Agreement\" dated November 29, 1999, between the Company and the Agent. However, the main document here is referred to as \"This Agreement\" in the Entire Agreement section. The title might just be \"Agreement\" unless there's a specific name mentioned elsewhere. \n\nLooking again, the context starts with sections (ii), (iii), etc., which are likely parts of the representations and warranties. The title given in the context is \"Representations and Warranties of the Agent,\" but that's a section, not the overall contract name. \n\nThe \"Entire Agreement\" section states that this Agreement supersedes prior agreements. The document is referred to as \"This Agreement\" throughout. Since there's no explicit name given like \"Consulting Agreement\" or \"Services Agreement,\" the safest answer is that the name of the contract is simply \"Agreement.\" However, sometimes in legal documents, the title is at the top. Since the user provided the context, maybe the title is mentioned in the first page or in the sections. Wait, the context starts with (ii), so maybe the first part is missing. But in the given text, the only explicit mention of a title is in the \"Entire Agreement\" section where it's called \"This Agreement.\" \n\nAlternatively, the \"Letter Agreement\" is mentioned as a separate document.

The provisions of Sections 3.6, 4, 6, 8, 9 and 11 shall survive any termination of the agreement (Section 10.8).\n\n2. Any contract entered into by the Parties with a Marketer for the Product shall survive termination of the agreement in accordance with its terms, including any renewal rights provided therein (Section 10.1). \n\n3. Upon any breach by CAPSUGEL, CARDAX shall be permitted to use all Intellectual Property of CAPSUGEL used in the Formulation and the Product to the extent necessary for the development and marketing of the Product (Section 10.2).\n\n4. Upon any breach by CARDAX, CAPSUGEL shall be permitted to use all Intellectual Property of CARDAX used in the Active Ingredient and the Product to the extent necessary for the development and marketing of the Product in accordance with the terms of the agreement as of the date of such termination (Section 10.2).\n\n5.

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether a party has obligations after the termination or expiration of a contract, including things like post-termination transition, payments, IP transfer, wind-down, last-buy, etc. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the provided context. The context is a legal agreement's termination section. Let me go through each part.\n\nStarting with the first paragraph: It says that upon termination, each party must return the other's property, including proprietary info, within 30 days unless required by law to retain. So that's a post-termination obligation\u2014returning property. Also mentions \"continuing obligations hereunder,\" which implies there are other obligations beyond just returning property.\n\nLooking at Section 10.1 Term and Renewal: It mentions that contracts with a Marketer for the Product survive termination according to their own terms. So any such contracts aren't automatically terminated and might have their own obligations.\n\nSection 10.3 Termination for Bankruptcy: Allows termination if the other party becomes bankrupt, etc. But does it mention obligations after termination? Not directly, but termination would trigger the general obligations in the first paragraph.\n\nSection 10.2 Termination for Breach: Talks about cure periods. If not cured, termination is allowed. Again, once terminated, the general obligations apply.\n\nThe IP ownership part says each party owns their own inventions and IP made under the agreement. So if the agreement terminates, maybe there's an obligation to transfer IP? Wait, the context says \"each Party will own all of its inventions...\" unless otherwise stated. So unless there's a specific clause about transferring IP upon termination, maybe not. But the first paragraph does mention returning property, which could include IP if it's considered property. However, the IP ownership is split, so maybe they don't have to transfer IP unless the agreement specifies otherwise.\n\nThe question is about whether there are post-termination obligations. The first paragraph clearly states that returning property is required, which is a post-termination obligation. Also, \"continuing obligations hereunder\" suggests there are other ongoing duties. The answer should mention returning property, any surviving contracts (from 10.1), and possible other obligations like those related to IP if specified. But the IP section says each owns their own, so maybe no transfer unless the agreement says so. However, the first paragraph says to return \"proprietary information,\" which might be part",

During the term of the franchise agreement, the franchisee agrees that neither it, its affiliates, nor its owners will have any direct or indirect interest in a \"Competitive Business\" located at the franchise site, within 3 miles of the franchise unit, or within 3 miles of any other Pretzel Time unit in operation or under development (Section 21.A).\n\n2.

The user is asking whether a party is restricted from contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty during or after the contract ends, based on the provided context.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the context given. The context includes three sections labeled B, C, and another part. Let me go through each part carefully.\n\nStarting with the first part: It mentions failure to transfer interest in the Agreement or Franchisee within a certain period is a breach. Then section B talks about permitted competitive businesses, form development agreement, identity of developer, and date. The next paragraph states that the obligations are conditional on executing and performing all obligations under the Agreement. It also says the Agreement is conditional on Franchisee executing documents within 10 days, otherwise it's null and void.\n\nSection C is about the Owner's and Guarantor's undertaking. It mentions that an offer must apply only to an interest in the Agreement, Franchisee, or the Unit, and can't include other properties or rights. If there's a separate offer to buy other properties, the price for the interest should reflect the bona fide price without considering other assets.\n\nNow, the question is about restrictions on soliciting customers or partners. The user wants to know if there's a restriction during or after the contract. Looking through the provided context, I don't see any mention of non-solicitation clauses, non-compete clauses, or restrictions on customers or partners. The sections discuss conditions for the agreement's validity, permitted businesses, and terms of offers, but nothing about solicitation or customer restrictions.\n\nThe answer should be based solely on the given context. Since there's no information about non-solicitation or similar restrictions, the answer would be that the context doesn't specify such restrictions. Therefore, the answer is no, unless there's an implied restriction elsewhere, but the context doesn't state it.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: The provided context does not explicitly address restrictions on contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty during or after the contract.

The document focuses on the term and effective date of the amendment, and it is signed by the representatives of the two companies, but there are no clauses indicating an exclusive dealing arrangement. Without any such provisions explicitly stated, the available information does not suggest the presence of an exclusive dealing commitment in this context.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if there's an exclusive dealing commitment in the provided context. The context is about an amendment to a co-branding agreement between PC Quote, Inc. (PCQ) and A.B. Watley, Inc. (ABW). \n\nFirst, I need to understand what an exclusive dealing commitment entails. From the question, it includes things like a commitment to procure all requirements from one party, prohibitions on licensing/selling to third parties, or collaborating with others, both during and after the contract.\n\nLooking at the provided documents, there's an amendment to Section 2 (Term) of the Co-Branding Agreement. The amendment is effective December 9, 1996, and involves PCQ and ABW. The documents mention that the amendment applies to PCQ and ABW and their subsidiaries and related companies. \n\nHowever, the actual content of the amendment isn't detailed here. The user provided the context which includes the agreement's parties and the fact that it's an amendment to the term section. But there's no specific mention of exclusivity clauses. The term \"exclusive\" isn't in the provided text. The amendment might be about the duration of the agreement or other terms related to the term, not necessarily exclusivity.\n\nSince the question is about whether there's an exclusive dealing commitment, and the provided context doesn't include any explicit language about exclusivity, prohibitions on dealing with others, or requirements to procure all needs from one party, I can't confirm such a commitment exists based solely on this information. The answer would likely be no, but I need to be careful not to assume. The absence of specific terms in the given context suggests there's no mention of exclusivity here. However, there might be other parts of the full agreement that aren't included here which could contain such clauses. But based strictly on the provided context, there's no indication of an exclusive dealing commitment.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: No, the provided context does not indicate an exclusive dealing commitment. The documents reference an amendment to the \"Term\" section of a co-branding agreement between PC Quote, Inc. (PCQ) and A.B. Watley, Inc. (ABW), but there is no explicit language about exclusivity, procurement requirements, prohibitions on third-party transactions, or restrictions on collaboration. The amendment\u2019s scope is limited to the term of the agreement, and no clauses enforcing exclusivity (",
