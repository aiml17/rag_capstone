The user is asking about the duration of any warranty against defects or errors in technology, products, or services provided under the contract. The context provided is an amendment to a co-branding agreement between PC Quote, Inc. (PCQ) and A.B. Watley, Inc. (ABW), effective December 9, 1996.\n\nFirst, I need to check the context thoroughly. The amendment is to Section 2, Part B of the Co-Branding Agreement, which is titled \"Term.\" The Term section usually outlines the duration of the contract. However, the user is asking about warranties, which are typically covered in a different section of a contract, such as a warranty clause. \n\nLooking at the provided context, there's no mention of warranties, defects, errors, or any duration related to them. The amendment here is about the term of the agreement, not warranties. The document includes the parties involved, the effective date, and signatures from both sides, but nothing about warranties. \n\nSince the question is about the warranty duration, and the context doesn't include any information on that, I can't find an answer here.

      "question": "Is a party\u2019s liability uncapped upon the breach of its obligation in the contract? This also includes uncap liability for a particular type of breach such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality obligation.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the context provided in the Cooperation Agreement, there does not appear to be any uncapped liability for a party's breach of the contract. The agreement does not explicitly state that a party's liability is uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.\n\nThe relevant sections are:\n\n1. Clause 5 on Confidential Information, which states that the obligations of confidentiality shall remain in force until the relevant information enters the public domain otherwise than by the default of a party. This suggests there is no uncapped liability for breach of the confidentiality obligation.\n\n2. Clause 4.1 regarding QIWI's obligation to settle transactions through Otkritie's bank. This clause states that if QIWI terminates this obligation, it shall pay a fee to Otkritie, but this fee is capped at RUB 50,000,000. This indicates a cap on liability for breach of this specific obligation.\n\n3. The agreement does not contain any other provisions that suggest uncapped liability for breach of the contract or specific types of breaches. The dispute resolution clause (Clause 9) also does not indicate uncapped damages.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the Cooperation Agreement, the liability of the parties does not appear to be uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether a party's liability is uncapped in case of a breach of the contract, specifically mentioning IP infringement or breach of confidentiality. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context to see if there's any mention of liability caps or limitations. The context includes clauses 5.1 to 5.4 about confidentiality and 7.1 to 7.6 about other terms like assignment and third-party rights.\n\nLooking at the confidentiality clauses (5.1-5.4), they outline the obligations of the parties not to disclose confidential information and the exceptions. However, there's no mention of liability limits or caps. The clauses specify what the parties can't do and the exceptions, but they don't state that liability is capped or uncapped. \n\nThen, checking the other clauses, especially 7.5 and 7.6, which deal with assignment and third-party rights. Still, no mention of liability caps. The rest of the clauses (like 7.2) talk about void provisions but not liability. \n\nSince the entire provided context doesn't include any terms about limiting liability, especially in the event of a breach, the default assumption under contract law is that liability isn't capped unless specified. Therefore, the answer would be that the liability is uncapped unless there's a specific clause limiting it, which there isn't here.\n</think>\n\nThe provided context does not include any explicit provisions capping or limiting a party's liability for breaches of the contract, including breaches of confidentiality obligations or intellectual property (IP) infringement. The confidentiality clauses (5.1\u20135.4) outline the obligations and exceptions for handling Confidential Information but do not specify liability limits. Similarly, other clauses (e.g., 7.1\u20137.6) address assignment, third-party rights, and severability but remain silent on liability caps. \n\nUnder general contract law principles, unless a contract explicitly limits liability (e.g., via a \"cap\" or exclusion clause), parties may be liable for uncapped damages arising from breaches. Since the context does not contain such a limitation, **a party\u2019s liability for breach of confidentiality or other obligations under this contract is uncapped**. However, this conclusion assumes no external legal framework (not provided here) imposes liability limits.",

The context provided is about a sponsor needing to obtain and maintain certain insurance policies.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the context. The sponsor must get insurance from an admitted carrier with an A.M. (maybe A.M. Best rating?) and the policies include Commercial General Liability with specific coverage. The key part here is the mention of \"Additional Insureds\" and that coverage applies on a primary basis regardless of other insurance. \n\nSo, the sponsor is required to have insurance that covers Additional Insureds. That sounds like the sponsor's insurance is for the benefit of those Additional Insureds, which are likely the counterparty or another party. The question is whether this is a requirement for one party (the sponsor) to maintain insurance for the counterparty's benefit. \n\nThe answer would be yes because the sponsor must maintain the insurance, and the Additional Insureds are covered under the policy. The part about \"primary basis irrespective of any other insurance\" means that even if the counterparty has their own insurance, the sponsor's policy is primary, ensuring coverage for them. So the requirement exists for the sponsor to maintain this insurance for the counterparty's benefit.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: Yes, the sponsor is required to maintain an Insurance Services Office occurrence-based Commercial General Liability Insurance Policy (with specified minimum limits) that includes coverage for \"Additional Insureds\" on a primary basis, regardless of other insurance.

The Distributor's rights are limited to their own use and any sublicensing they might do under the agreement's terms, but without explicit mention of affiliates, the answer would be that the contract does not include a license grant to affiliates.

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out the answer to the question \"The name of the contract\" based on the provided context. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the context given. The context seems to be parts of a legal agreement, possibly a securities offering agreement, given references to the Company, MHC (which might stand for Mutual Holding Company), the Bank, the Agent, and mentions of the Registration Statement, Prospectus, and the 1934 Act (which is the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). \n\nLooking at the sections provided, there are several clauses. The first part (dd) talks about certificates signed by officers and how they are considered representations and warranties. Then there's section (i) about not selling Common Stock without the Agent's consent for 90 days after the Closing Date. Section (j) mentions registering Common Stock under Section 12(g) of the 1934 Act. \n\nFurther down, there's a section labeled \"Entire Agreement\" which states that this Agreement, including schedules and exhibits, is the entire agreement between the parties, superseding any prior agreements. This is a standard clause in contracts to prevent prior agreements from conflicting.\n\nThe question is asking for the name of the contract. In legal documents, the \"Entire Agreement\" clause usually refers to the contract itself. The way it's phrased here: \"This Agreement, including schedules and exhibits hereto... constitutes the entire agreement...\" suggests that the document being referred to is the agreement itself. \n\nLooking at the structure, the document is likely titled something like \"Agreement\" or \"Offering Agreement,\" but the exact name isn't explicitly stated in the provided context. However, in the \"Entire Agreement\" clause, the document is referred to as \"This Agreement,\" which is a common way to denote the contract's name. \n\nSince the user is asking for the name of the contract, and the context doesn't explicitly state the full title (like \"Securities Purchase Agreement\" or \"Stock Offering Agreement\"), but the entire document is referred to as \"This Agreement,\" the answer would be \"Agreement.\" However, sometimes in such contexts, the name might be more specific. But given the information here, the most accurate answer based on the text is \"Agreement\" as that's the term used throughout the document to refer to itself.\n</think>\n\nThe name of the contract is **Agreement**",

So that's a clear post-termination obligation about returning property.\n\nThen, looking at Section 10.1, it mentions that contracts with a Marketer survive termination according to their own terms. Also, CAPSUGEL has to keep records for 5 years after termination. So there's a record retention obligation.\n\nThe next part says Sections 3.6, 4, 6, 8, 9, and 11 survive termination. Without knowing what those sections are, but based on the numbers, maybe they cover things like payment terms, IP, etc. Since the first paragraph mentions returning proprietary info, maybe those sections include other obligations.\n\nSection 10.2 talks about termination for breach, allowing a cure period. If not cured, termination happens. But during the cure period, if they're making progress, it can be extended. This implies that even after termination, there might be ongoing obligations related to curing the breach, though that's part of the termination process.\n\nThe question mentions specific areas like transition, payments, IP transfer, wind-down, last-buy. The context mentions returning property (which could include IP), retaining records (which is a post-termination obligation), and survival of certain sections. If Sections 3.6, 4, etc., cover those areas, then yes, there are obligations.\n\nFor example, if Section 4 is about payments, then those payment obligations might survive. If Section 6 is about IP, then transferring IP might be part of the return of property mentioned. The 5-year record retention by CAPSUGEL is a specific post-termination obligation.\n\nAlso, the first paragraph's requirement to return property within 30 days is a direct post-termination obligation. The survival of certain sections means that whatever those sections outline (like payment terms, IP handling, etc.) remains in effect after termination",

      "question": "Is a party restricted from contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty, whether during the contract or after the contract ends (or both)?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, the franchise agreement contains restrictions on the franchisee's ability to compete with Pretzel Time, both during the term of the franchise agreement and after its termination or expiration.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n1. During the term of the franchise agreement, the franchisee agrees that neither it, its affiliates, nor its owners will have any direct or indirect interest in a \"Competitive Business\" located at the franchise site, within 3 miles of the franchise unit, or within 3 miles of any other Pretzel Time unit in operation or under development (Section 21.A).\n\n2. After termination or expiration of the franchise agreement, the franchisee and its owners agree not to have any direct or indirect interest in a Competitive Business located at the franchise site, within 3 miles of the franchise unit, or within 3 miles of any other Pretzel Time unit in operation or under development for a period of 12 months (Section 20.G).\n\nThe agreement also restricts the franchisee from recruiting or hiring any employees who were employed by Pretzel Time or another Pretzel Time franchisee within the prior 6 months, without Pretzel Time's prior written permission (Section 21.A(2)).\n\nSo in summary, the franchise agreement imposes non-compete and non-solicitation restrictions on the franchisee both during the contract term and for a period after the contract ends.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether a party is restricted from contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty during or after the contract ends. They provided some context from an agreement.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the context given. The context mentions two main points. The first part is about consent or approval, stating that a party can't unreasonably withhold consent unless it's under their sole discretion. The second part says that no agreement is binding unless in writing and signed by both. Then there's a section titled \"NO LIABILITY FOR ACTS OF OTHER PARTY\" under 21.C and a mention of a \"THIRD PARTY ASSIGNMENT AGREEMENT.\"\n\nThe question is about restrictions on soliciting customers or partners. The key here is to check if the provided context includes any non-solicitation clauses. The context doesn't mention anything about non-solicitation, non-compete, or post-termination restrictions. The sections provided are about consent, written agreements, and liability for acts of the other party. The \"NO LIABILITY FOR ACTS OF OTHER PARTY\" might relate to not being liable for the other party's actions, but that's not directly about soliciting customers.\n\nSince the context doesn't include any specific clauses about non-solicitation during or after the contract, the answer would be that there's no restriction based on the provided information. The user might need to check other parts of the agreement for such clauses, but based on what's given here, the answer is no.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: The provided context does not include any specific clauses restricting a party from contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty during or after the contract. The text focuses on consent requirements, the necessity of written agreements, and liability disclaimers, but it does not address non-solicitation or non-compete obligations. Therefore, based on the given information, **there is no restriction** on such actions. Parties should review the full agreement for potential non-solicitation provisions elsewhere.",

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if there's an exclusive dealing commitment in this context. The user provided a document that's an amendment to a co-branding agreement between PC Quote, Inc. (PCQ) and A.B. Watley, Inc. (ABW). The question is whether there's an exclusive dealing commitment, which would mean one party is required to get all their needs from the other or can't work with others.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context. The main document is an amendment to Section 2, Part B of the Co-Branding Agreement, effective December 9, 1996. The amendment is between PCQ and ABW. The document mentions that the amendment applies to PCQ and ABW and their subsidiaries and related companies. \n\nHowever, the actual content of the amendment isn't detailed here. The user provided the title and some signatures, but the key part (the amendment's terms) is redacted with [***]. So, the only information available is the title of the amendment and the parties involved. \n\nThe question is about exclusive dealing commitments. Since the amendment is to the \"Term\" section (Section 2, Part B), maybe it's about the duration of the agreement, but not necessarily exclusivity. However, co-branding agreements can sometimes include exclusivity clauses. But without seeing the actual terms of the amendment, it's hard to tell. \n\nThe user's context doesn't mention any specific exclusivity terms. The answer would depend on whether the amendment includes such a commitment. Since the redacted part [***] is where the actual terms would be, and there's no mention of exclusivity in the visible parts, the answer would likely be that there's no indication of an exclusive dealing commitment based on the provided information. \n\nBut wait, maybe the original Co-Branding Agreement had exclusivity terms, and this amendment modifies them? The user's context doesn't say. Since the amendment is only about the term, maybe it's just changing the duration, not adding exclusivity. Without more details, the safest answer is that there's no evidence of an exclusive dealing commitment in the provided context.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: The provided context does not indicate the presence of an exclusive dealing commitment.
