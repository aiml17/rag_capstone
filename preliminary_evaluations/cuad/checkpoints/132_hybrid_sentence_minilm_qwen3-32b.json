The amendment is dated December 9, 1996, and the signatures are from December 5 and 12, 1996.\n\nFirst, I need to check the provided context thoroughly. The context mentions an amendment to Section 2, Part B of the Co-Branding Agreement, which is titled \"Term.\" The Term section usually deals with the duration of the contract, not warranties. The amendment itself is about modifying the term, but there's no mention of warranties in the provided text. \n\nThe user's question is about warranties, which are typically covered in a different section of a contract, such as a \"Warranties\" section. Since the context only discusses an amendment to the Term (Section 2, Part B), there's no information here about warranties. The answer would need to state that the provided context doesn't include details about warranty duration. \n\nI should make sure not to infer or assume any information beyond what's given. The answer should be based solely on the context provided, which doesn't mention warranties. Therefore, the correct response is that the duration of the warranty isn't specified in the given context.\n</think>\n\nThe provided context does not specify the duration of any warranty against defects or errors in technology, products, or services under the contract.

      "question": "Is a party\u2019s liability uncapped upon the breach of its obligation in the contract? This also includes uncap liability for a particular type of breach such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality obligation.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the context provided in the Cooperation Agreement, there does not appear to be any uncapped liability for a party's breach of the contract. The agreement does not explicitly state that a party's liability is uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.\n\nThe relevant sections are:\n\n1. Clause 5 on Confidential Information, which states that the obligations of confidentiality shall remain in force until the relevant information enters the public domain otherwise than by the default of a party. This suggests there is no uncapped liability for breach of the confidentiality obligation.\n\n2. Clause 4.1 regarding QIWI's obligation to settle transactions through Otkritie's bank. This clause states that if QIWI terminates this obligation, it shall pay a fee to Otkritie, but this fee is capped at RUB 50,000,000. This indicates a cap on liability for breach of this specific obligation.\n\n3. The agreement does not contain any other provisions that suggest uncapped liability for breach of the contract or specific types of breaches. The dispute resolution clause (Clause 9) also does not indicate uncapped damages.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the Cooperation Agreement, the liability of the parties does not appear to be uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether a party's liability is uncapped if they breach the contract, specifically looking at IP infringement or breach of confidentiality. The context provided is from a confidentiality clause (Clause 5.1 to 5.3) in a contract.\n\nFirst, I need to check the context for any mention of liability caps or exclusions. The main clauses here are about confidentiality obligations. Clause 5.1 says parties must not disclose confidential info except as allowed in 5.2. The exceptions in 5.2 include things like performance of obligations, affiliates, legal requirements, etc. \n\nLooking through the clauses, there's no mention of limiting liability for breaches. The clauses outline what's allowed and what's not, but there's no part that says \"liability is limited\" or \"excluded\" for certain breaches. The absence of such a clause might imply that liability isn't capped, but I need to be careful. Sometimes contracts have separate liability clauses elsewhere. However, the user provided only the confidentiality section. \n\nThe question also mentions IP infringement. The context doesn't discuss IP, so unless there's a connection here. The confidentiality breach is covered, but IP infringement would be a different type of breach. Since the context doesn't address IP, maybe the answer is that the provided context doesn't specify, but based on the confidentiality clauses, there's no cap mentioned. \n\nBut the user is asking if the liability is uncapped. Since the contract doesn't include any exclusions or caps in the provided clauses, the default would be that liability is not capped. However, in many contracts, there are separate liability clauses that might limit damages. Since the user hasn't provided those, I can only go by the given context. \n\nSo, the answer would be that based on the provided context, there's no indication that liability is capped for breaches like confidentiality. The clauses don't mention any exclusions or limitations on liability, so it's likely uncapped. But for IP infringement, since it's not covered here, we can't say based on this context. The user might need to check other parts of the contract for liability terms.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: The provided context does not explicitly address whether a party\u2019s liability is uncapped for breaches of the contract, including intellectual property (IP) infringement or breach of confidentiality obligations. The confidentiality clauses (5.1\u20135.3) focus on restrictions",

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if there's a requirement for insurance that one party must maintain for the benefit of the counterparty. The context provided is a Sponsorship Agreement, specifically between the Sponsor and the Padres Parties (which include SDBF, Padres LP, the City of San Diego, etc.).\n\nFirst, I need to parse through the context to find where insurance requirements are mentioned. The Sponsor is required to obtain and maintain certain insurance policies. Let me check the sections again.\n\nLooking at the first part, under the Sponsor's obligations, they must have Workers' Compensation and Commercial General Liability Insurance. The Commercial General Liability Policy needs to name SDBF, Padres LP, the City of San Diego, and their subsidiaries as Additional Insureds. Also, there's a mention of Cross Liability Endorsements and a Waiver of Subrogation in favor of SDBF. \n\nSo, the Sponsor's insurance policies must cover these other parties (the Padres Parties) as Additional Insureds. That means if there's a claim against them, the Sponsor's insurance would provide coverage. Additionally, the Waiver of Subrogation means the insurance company can't go after SDBF for a loss that's covered. \n\nThen, there's an indemnification clause where SDBF agrees to protect the Sponsor from claims arising from their negligence or willful misconduct. But the question is about insurance maintained by one party for the benefit of the counterparty. \n\nThe Sponsor is required to have insurance that includes the Padres Parties as Additional Insureds. That's a clear example of the Sponsor's insurance benefiting the counterparty (Padres Parties). Similarly, the Waiver of Subrogation in favor of SDBF also benefits them. \n\nAdditionally, the Sponsor must provide certificates of insurance to SDBF, ensuring compliance. The requirement for the insurance to be with an admitted carrier with an A.M. Best rating of A-8 or better adds to the obligation. \n\nSo, yes, there's a requirement for the Sponsor to maintain insurance (Workers' Comp and General Liability) that includes the counterparty (Padres Parties) as Additional Insureds and provides a Waiver of Subrogation. This is done for the benefit of the counterparty. The answer should confirm this and reference the specific insurance policies and their terms that cover the counterparty.\n</think>\n\nYes, the Sponsor is required to maintain specific insurance policies for the benefit of",

The user is asking about the renewal term after the initial term expires, including automatic extensions and unilateral extensions with prior notice. The context provided is from a legal agreement between a Principal and a Distributor.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the context for any mention of renewal terms. The initial term is stated in point 10: \"This Agreement shall be in effect until March 18. 2021, unless sooner terminated by either party upon (30) days written notice, without cause.\" So the initial term ends on March 18, 2021, but either party can terminate it 30 days before that by giving notice.\n\nNow, the question is about the renewal term after the initial term. The user is asking if there's any automatic extension or if one party can unilaterally extend with notice. Looking through the provided context, there's no mention of an automatic renewal clause. The termination clause allows for termination with 30 days' notice, but that's about ending the agreement, not renewing it. \n\nOther sections like 11 and 12 talk about what happens upon termination, like the Distributor's rights to existing orders and non-contest of termination. There's a mention of the Distributor not handling competitive products during the term (section 6) and discounts (section 10), but nothing about what happens after the initial term ends. \n\nThe key point here is that the agreement doesn't specify a renewal term. The only way the agreement continues beyond March 18, 2021, would be if both parties agree to a new agreement.

The termination clause allows for ending the agreement with notice, but not for extending it automatically or unilaterally.\n</think>\n\nThe provided context does not specify a **renewal term** after the initial term expires on March 18, 2021.

      "question": "Does the contract contain a license grant to a licensee (incl. sublicensor) and the affiliates of such licensee/sublicensor?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "No, the contract does not contain a license grant to a licensee or the affiliates of such licensee. The contract grants Distributor (GLS LLC) a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use and sublicense the Software provided by Airspan, but it does not explicitly grant a license or rights to any affiliates of the Distributor.\n\nSpecifically, Section 11.1 states:\n\n\"Airspan grants Distributor, and Distributor hereby accepts, a nonexclusive, non-transferable license to use, and to sublicense as set forth below, Software provided by Airspan hereunder only on a single System or unit of Equipment, as may be applicable.\"\n\nThere is no mention of affiliates of the Distributor being granted any license or rights to the Software.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the contract contains a license grant to the licensee and their affiliates. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context for any mentions of licensing. The user mentioned sections about the Software License. Let me check those.\n\nLooking at section 11.1: It says Airspan grants Distributor a nonexclusive, non-transferable license to use and sublicense the Software. The license is for use on a single System or unit of Equipment. The key terms here are \"non-transferable\" and \"sublicense as set forth below.\" Wait, the context doesn't show what's in the \"as set forth below\" part, but maybe there's more info elsewhere.\n\nAlso, in section 1.1, it mentions that the Distributor's appointment includes a license to resell Airspan Products. But that's about reselling, not software licensing. \n\nIn 11.1 again, the license is specifically for the Distributor. The question is about whether the license extends to affiliates. The term \"non-transferable\" usually means you can't transfer the license to another party. But the Distributor can sublicense as per the agreement. However, the context doesn't explicitly mention affiliates. \n\nWait, the question is about the license grant to the licensee (Distributor) and their affiliates. The contract says the license is non-transferable. If it's non-transferable, then the Distributor can't transfer it to affiliates. However, the Distributor can sublicense, but the sublicense terms aren't detailed here. \n\nAlso, in 11.1, the license is for the Distributor to use and sublicense. If the sublicense is allowed, maybe the affiliates could be covered under that, but the contract doesn't specify. Since the license is non-transferable, the Distributor can't transfer it to affiliates. Unless the sublicense allows it. But without more info on the sublicense terms, we can't be sure. \n\nThe answer might be that the license is granted to the Distributor (licensee) but not explicitly to their affiliates, as the license is non-transferable. Unless the sublicense provisions allow it, but the context doesn't provide those details. Therefore, based on the given info, the answer is no, because the license is non-transferable and doesn't mention affiliates.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: The contract grants a nonexclusive, non-transferable license to the Distributor (the licensee",

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking for the name of the contract based on the provided context. I need to look through the context to find any references to the contract's name.\n\nLooking at the beginning, there's a mention of \"The undersigned hereby represents and warrants for the benefit of the Remarketing Agent, the Fund and the Calculation and Paying Agent...\" So the contract involves these parties. Then, later on, there's a section that says \"This Agreement may be amended by any instrument in writing...\" which suggests that the document itself is referred to as \"This Agreement.\" \n\nAlso, in the definitions section towards the end, \"Agreement\" is defined as having the meaning set forth in the preamble. The preamble is the introductory part of a contract, so that's probably where the name is. However, the actual title isn't explicitly stated in the provided text. The closest we get is references to \"Tender Notice\" and \"Tender and Paying Agent Agreement\" mentioned in Section 23. \n\nWait, in the context, there's a mention of \"Tender and Paying Agent Agreement\" in the part about amendments needing prior notice. Also, the sections listed at the end like \"Dealing in the VRRM-MFP Shares 7 Section 7. Information 8...\" might be part of a table of contents or section headings. \n\nPutting it all together, the main agreement here seems to be the \"Tender and Paying Agent Agreement\" since it's referenced in the context of amendments and definitions. The document itself is likely part of that agreement, so the name of the contract would be the \"Tender and Paying Agent Agreement.\" Alternatively, since the preamble is mentioned, but the actual name isn't given here, but based on the references, \"Tender and Paying Agent Agreement\" is the most specific name provided.\n</think>\n\nThe name of the contract is the **Tender and Paying Agent Agreement**.

      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, based on the information provided in the agreement, there are certain obligations that continue after the termination or expiration of the contract:\n\n1. The provisions of Sections 3.6, 4, 6, 8, 9 and 11 shall survive any termination of the agreement (Section 10.8).\n\n2. Any contract entered into by the Parties with a Marketer for the Product shall survive termination of the agreement in accordance with its terms, including any renewal rights provided therein (Section 10.1). \n\n3. Upon any breach by CAPSUGEL, CARDAX shall be permitted to use all Intellectual Property of CAPSUGEL used in the Formulation and the Product to the extent necessary for the development and marketing of the Product (Section 10.2).\n\n4. Upon any breach by CARDAX, CAPSUGEL shall be permitted to use all Intellectual Property of CARDAX used in the Active Ingredient and the Product to the extent necessary for the development and marketing of the Product in accordance with the terms of the agreement as of the date of such termination (Section 10.2).\n\n5. Each Party shall return to the other Party or to the other Party's designee no later than thirty (30) days after the effective date of termination all of such other Party's property, including all proprietary information, in its possession, except to the extent required to be retained by law or to comply with such Party's continuing obligations (Section 10.7).\n\nSo in summary, yes there are certain post-termination obligations, including the survival of certain provisions, the continuing effect of third-party contracts, and the return of proprietary information and materials.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether a party is subject to obligations after the termination or expiration of a contract, including things like post-termination transition, payment, transfer of IP, wind-down, last-buy, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the provided context. The context includes several sections from a contract, specifically sections 10.7 Property, 10.8 Survival, 11.1 Dispute Resolution, and parts of Section 9 Confidentiality and Section 10 Term and Termination. \n\nStarting with Section 10.7 Property: It states that upon termination, each party must return the other's property, including proprietary information, within 30 days, except what's required by law or to comply with continuing obligations. So this directly addresses the transfer of property/IP after termination.\n\nSection 10.8 Survival mentions that certain sections (like 3.6, 4, 6, 8, 9, and 11) survive termination. This means those sections' obligations remain in effect even after the contract ends. Since Section 11 includes Dispute Resolution, that's a surviving obligation.\n\nLooking at Section 10.1 Term and Renewal, it mentions that contracts with a Marketer for the Product survive termination according to their own terms. So there's a survival of certain contracts post-termination.\n\nIn Section 10.2 Termination for Breach, there's a clause allowing CARDAX to use CAPSUGEL's IP if there's a breach. This implies that even after termination due to breach, there are obligations related to IP transfer.\n\nAlso, Section 10.6 No Waiver states that not terminating for a breach doesn't waive future rights. This shows that obligations related to breaches can persist after termination.\n\nThe question also mentions post-termination transition, payments, etc. While the context doesn't explicitly mention payments, the return of property (Section 10.7) and survival of sections like 4 (which might cover payments) under 10.8 Survival suggests that some financial obligations could remain. However, the exact mention of payments isn't there, so maybe it's implied through other sections.\n\nThe answer should confirm that yes, there are obligations post-termination, citing the return of property, survival of certain sections, and specific clauses about IP transfer and surviving contracts. Also, the survival of confidentiality",

It usually means that one party agrees to buy all their needs from the other, or not to deal with others, or similar restrictions. The question is whether such a commitment exists here.\n\nLooking at the provided context, the main content is the amendment to the Term section. The term of a contract typically refers to its duration, not necessarily exclusivity. The amendment might be changing how long the agreement lasts, but there's no mention of exclusivity in the text given.

However, co-branding doesn't inherently imply exclusivity unless specified. Since the amendment here is only about the term (duration) and there's no mention of exclusive dealing terms, it's likely that there's no such commitment. The answer would be no unless there's a hidden clause in the original agreement that's not mentioned here, but the context provided doesn't include that information.

The document describes an amendment to the \"Term\" section of a co-branding agreement, focusing on the duration of the agreement (effective December 9, 1996) and signatures from both parties. There is no mention of obligations to procure all goods/services from one party, prohibitions on working with third parties, or exclusivity clauses during or after the contract.
