      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the context provided in the Cooperation Agreement, there does not appear to be any uncapped liability for a party's breach of the contract. The agreement does not explicitly state that a party's liability is uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.\n\nThe relevant sections are:\n\n1. Clause 5 on Confidential Information, which states that the obligations of confidentiality shall remain in force until the relevant information enters the public domain otherwise than by the default of a party. This suggests there is no uncapped liability for breach of the confidentiality obligation.\n\n2. Clause 4.1 regarding QIWI's obligation to settle transactions through Otkritie's bank. This clause states that if QIWI terminates this obligation, it shall pay a fee to Otkritie, but this fee is capped at RUB 50,000,000. This indicates a cap on liability for breach of this specific obligation.\n\n3. The agreement does not contain any other provisions that suggest uncapped liability for breach of the contract or specific types of breaches. The dispute resolution clause (Clause 9) also does not indicate uncapped damages.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the Cooperation Agreement, the liability of the parties does not appear to be uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.",

However, the contract does not contain any provisions that would suggest uncapped liability for a particular type of breach, such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality obligation.\n\nIn fact, the contract does not contain any provisions that would suggest liability caps or limits for breach of contract. This suggests that the parties intended for liability to be uncapped in the event of a breach.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the contract does contain provisions that suggest the parties may be liable for certain types of damages, such as:\n\n* Clause 5.4, which suggests that a party may be liable for damages if its Affiliate is compelled to disclose confidential information without a protective order.\n* Clause 5.3, which suggests that a party may be liable for damages if it fails to give notice to the other party of a disclosure of confidential information.\n\nHowever, these provisions do not suggest that liability is capped, and it is likely that the parties intended for liability to be uncapped in the event of a breach.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the contract does not contain any provisions that would suggest the parties intended to limit their liability for certain types of damages, such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality obligation.

Any contract entered into by the Parties with a Marketer for the Product shall survive termination of the agreement in accordance with its terms, including any renewal rights provided therein (Section 10.1). \n\n3. Upon any breach by CAPSUGEL, CARDAX shall be permitted to use all Intellectual Property of CAPSUGEL used in the Formulation and the Product to the extent necessary for the development and marketing of the Product (Section 10.2).\n\n4.

This suggests that the parties may have post-termination obligations or commitments that are specifically agreed to in writing.\n\nTherefore, the answer is yes, a party is subject to obligations after the termination or expiration of a contract, including any post-termination transition, payment, transfer of IP, wind-down, last-buy, or similar commitments.",
