The context is an amendment to the \"Term\" section of a Co-Branding Agreement between PC Quote, Inc. and A.B.

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking about the duration of any warranty against defects or errors in technology, products, or services provided under the contract. The context given is an amendment to a co-branding agreement between PC Quote, Inc. (PCQ) and A.B. Watley, Inc. (ABW), effective December 9, 1996.\n\nFirst, I need to check the provided context thoroughly. The amendment is to Section 2, Part B of the Co-Branding Agreement, which is titled \"Term.\" The Term section usually outlines the duration of the contract, but the user is asking about warranties, which are typically covered in a different section. \n\nLooking at the context, the main content is the amendment to the Term. There's a mention of the parties involved and the effective dates of the amendment. However, there's no mention of warranties, defects, errors, or any duration related to those. The sources provided are the S-1/A filing from 1999, which is an SEC filing, but again, the context here is limited to the amendment of the Term section.\n\nSince the question is about warranties, and the provided context doesn't include any information on that topic, I can't find the answer here. The user might be expecting that the warranty duration is covered in the original Co-Branding Agreement, but since the context only provides an amendment to the Term section, there's no data to answer the question. Therefore, the answer would be that the information isn't available in the provided context.\n</think>\n\nThe provided context does not include any specific information regarding the duration of warranties against defects or errors in technology, products, or services under the Co-Branding Agreement. The text focuses solely on an amendment to the \"Term\" section of the agreement and does not address warranty terms.

      "question": "Is a party\u2019s liability uncapped upon the breach of its obligation in the contract? This also includes uncap liability for a particular type of breach such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality obligation.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the context provided in the Cooperation Agreement, there does not appear to be any uncapped liability for a party's breach of the contract. The agreement does not explicitly state that a party's liability is uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.\n\nThe relevant sections are:\n\n1. Clause 5 on Confidential Information, which states that the obligations of confidentiality shall remain in force until the relevant information enters the public domain otherwise than by the default of a party. This suggests there is no uncapped liability for breach of the confidentiality obligation.\n\n2. Clause 4.1 regarding QIWI's obligation to settle transactions through Otkritie's bank. This clause states that if QIWI terminates this obligation, it shall pay a fee to Otkritie, but this fee is capped at RUB 50,000,000. This indicates a cap on liability for breach of this specific obligation.\n\n3. The agreement does not contain any other provisions that suggest uncapped liability for breach of the contract or specific types of breaches. The dispute resolution clause (Clause 9) also does not indicate uncapped damages.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the Cooperation Agreement, the liability of the parties does not appear to be uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether a party's liability is uncapped in case of a breach of the contract, specifically mentioning IP infringement and breach of confidentiality. I need to look through the provided context to see if there's any mention of liability caps or limitations.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the clauses. The context includes clauses 5.1 to 5.4 about confidentiality and 7.1 to 7.6 about assignments and third-party rights. There's a lot about confidentiality obligations, like not disclosing information except under certain circumstances. But I don't see any specific mention of liability limits or caps. \n\nLooking at the confidentiality clauses (5.1-5.4), they outline when disclosure is allowed and the obligations to maintain confidentiality, but there's no mention of how much liability a party might have if they breach these. Similarly, in the other clauses, like 7.5 and 7.6, which deal with assignment and third-party enforcement, there's no mention of liability caps either.\n\nThe question also mentions IP infringement. However, the context provided doesn't include any clauses related to intellectual property. The user might be assuming that IP is covered under confidentiality, but the context doesn't specify. Since there's no mention of liability limits for any breaches, including confidentiality or IP, the answer would be that liability isn't capped here. \n\nBut wait, sometimes contracts have a general limitation of liability clause. Let me check again. The context doesn't have a clause that says \"not liable for indirect damages\" or \"liability is limited to a certain amount.\" All the clauses here are about obligations and permitted actions, not about the extent of liability. So, unless there's a specific exclusion or cap mentioned, the default would be that liability isn't capped. \n\nTherefore, based on the provided context, there's no indication that the liability is capped. The answer should be that the liability is not uncapped, meaning it's not limited, so the party could be fully liable for breaches like confidentiality or IP infringement.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: The provided context does not specify whether a party\u2019s liability is capped or uncapped upon breach of the contract, including for IP infringement or confidentiality breaches. The clauses focus on obligations (e.g., confidentiality, non-assignment) and permitted exceptions but do not explicitly address liability limits or caps.

Workers' Compensation insurance with minimum liability limits.\n\n2. An occurrence-based Commercial General Liability Insurance Policy with minimum liability limits.\n\nThe policies must name SDBF, Padres LP, the City of San Diego, and their subsidiary/affiliated companies and directors/officers/employees as Additional Insureds. The policies must also contain Cross Liability Endorsements and a Waiver of Subrogation in favor of SDBF.\n\nSponsor must provide SDBF with certificates of insurance evidencing compliance with these insurance requirements prior to the commencement of the sponsorship and annually prior to the expiration of each required insurance policy.",

The policies need to cover Additional Insureds on a primary basis, regardless of other insurance. Also, there's a mention of Cross Liability Endorsements and the insurer needing to be an admitted carrier with an A.M. rating.\n\nSo, the key points here are that the sponsor is required to have insurance that benefits others (Additional Insureds), which implies the counterparty might be one of those. The cross liability endorsements mean that if there's a claim, the policies work together, but here it's specified that the coverage for Additional Insureds is primary. \n\nThe question is whether this is a requirement for one party (the sponsor) to maintain insurance for the counterparty's benefit. Since the Additional Insureds are covered under the sponsor's policy, and the policy must be maintained by the sponsor, this seems to meet the requirement. The answer should be yes, based on the context provided.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: Yes, the context requires the sponsor to maintain insurance policies (with Cross Liability Endorsements) issued by an admitted carrier, which must provide coverage for \"Additional Insureds\" on a primary basis.

The termination clause is about ending the agreement, not extending it. The parties can terminate it with 30 days notice, but if they don't terminate it, does it just end?

The user mentioned sections 11.1 and 11.2, which are about the license granted by Airspan to the Distributor. \n\nIn section 11.1, it says that Airspan grants the Distributor a nonexclusive, non-transferable license to use the Software on a single System or unit of Equipment. It also mentions that the Distributor can sublicense as set forth in the agreement. The key points here are that the license is non-transferable, but there's a mention of sublicensing. However, the sublicense is only allowed as specified, and the license is for use on Airspan's systems.\n\nThen, in section 11.2, there are more restrictions. The Distributor must use the Software only on Systems provided by Airspan, and they can't modify or reverse engineer it. Also, they have to return the software if there's a breach. \n\nLooking at the other sections, like 3.10 and 3.11, they talk about the Distributor not promoting or selling outside the territory without approval, but that's more about distribution rights rather than licensing. \n\nThe question is whether the contract includes a license grant to the licensee (Distributor) and their affiliates. The license in 11.1 is non-transferable, which usually means you can't assign it to someone else. However, there's a part in 21.3 about assignment and subsidiaries. It says that if the assignment is to a subsidiary or affiliate, the consent can't be unreasonably withheld. But this is about assigning the entire agreement, not just the license. \n\nThe license itself is non-transferable, so even if the Distributor is part of a larger company with affiliates, the license isn't automatically extended to them. The Distributor can't sublicense except as specified. The sublicense mentioned in 11.1 is probably for customers, not affiliates. \n\nSo, the main license is to the Distributor, but not to their affiliates unless Airspan gives specific consent. The non-transferable clause would prevent the Distributor from transferring the license to their affiliates without permission.

The provisions of Sections 3.6, 4, 6, 8, 9 and 11 shall survive any termination of the agreement (Section 10.8).\n\n2. Any contract entered into by the Parties with a Marketer for the Product shall survive termination of the agreement in accordance with its terms, including any renewal rights provided therein (Section 10.1). \n\n3. Upon any breach by CAPSUGEL, CARDAX shall be permitted to use all Intellectual Property of CAPSUGEL used in the Formulation and the Product to the extent necessary for the development and marketing of the Product (Section 10.2).\n\n4. Upon any breach by CARDAX, CAPSUGEL shall be permitted to use all Intellectual Property of CARDAX used in the Active Ingredient and the Product to the extent necessary for the development and marketing of the Product in accordance with the terms of the agreement as of the date of such termination (Section 10.2).\n\n5.

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether a party has obligations after the termination or expiration of a contract, including things like transition, payments, IP transfer, wind-down, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the provided context. The context includes several sections from a contract's termination clause. Let me go through each part to see what obligations are mentioned.\n\nStarting with the first paragraph: It says that upon termination, each party must return the other's property and proprietary information within 30 days, unless required by law or for continuing obligations. So that's a post-termination obligation about returning property.\n\nSection 10.3 talks about termination due to bankruptcy. If one party becomes bankrupt, the other can terminate immediately. This is a specific termination condition but doesn't mention ongoing obligations beyond that.\n\nSection 10.1 mentions that contracts with a Marketer for the Product survive termination. So there's a survival clause for those specific contracts. Also, there's a part about product liability insurance needing to be maintained for two years after termination or expiry. That's a post-termination obligation related to insurance.\n\nThen there's a statement about not waiving rights by failing to terminate for a breach. This is more about the legal rights rather than ongoing obligations.\n\nPutting this together, the answer should mention the return of property, survival of certain contracts, product liability insurance for two years, and possibly other obligations mentioned in the contract. The question also asks about transition, payments, IP transfer, etc. The context specifically mentions returning proprietary information, which relates to IP transfer. The product liability insurance is a financial obligation. The survival of marketer contracts might involve transition or payments. The answer should confirm that yes, there are obligations post-termination, and list the examples from the context.\n</think>\n\nYes, a party is subject to obligations after the termination or expiration of the contract, including post-termination commitments. The context outlines several such obligations:  \n1. **Return of Property and Proprietary Information**: Each party must return the other\u2019s property and proprietary information within 30 days of termination, unless legally required to retain it or to fulfill ongoing obligations.  \n2. **Survival of Subsidiary Contracts**: Contracts entered into with a Marketer for the Product survive termination in accordance with their terms, including renewal rights.  \n3. **Product Liability Insurance**: Both parties must maintain adequate product liability insurance for the Product for two (2",
