      "question": "Is a party\u2019s liability uncapped upon the breach of its obligation in the contract? This also includes uncap liability for a particular type of breach such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality obligation.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the context provided in the Cooperation Agreement, there does not appear to be any uncapped liability for a party's breach of the contract. The agreement does not explicitly state that a party's liability is uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.\n\nThe relevant sections are:\n\n1. Clause 5 on Confidential Information, which states that the obligations of confidentiality shall remain in force until the relevant information enters the public domain otherwise than by the default of a party. This suggests there is no uncapped liability for breach of the confidentiality obligation.\n\n2. Clause 4.1 regarding QIWI's obligation to settle transactions through Otkritie's bank. This clause states that if QIWI terminates this obligation, it shall pay a fee to Otkritie, but this fee is capped at RUB 50,000,000. This indicates a cap on liability for breach of this specific obligation.\n\n3. The agreement does not contain any other provisions that suggest uncapped liability for breach of the contract or specific types of breaches. The dispute resolution clause (Clause 9) also does not indicate uncapped damages.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the Cooperation Agreement, the liability of the parties does not appear to be uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.",
      "generated_response": "**Short answer:**  \nBased on the portions of the agreement that you have supplied, there is **no clause that limits or caps a party\u2019s liability** for any breach \u2013 whether it is a general breach of contract, an infringement of intellectual\u2011property rights, or a breach of the confidentiality obligations set out in Clause\u202f5. Consequently, under the text you provided, a party\u2019s liability would be **uncapped** for those breaches (subject, of course, to any limitation\u2011of\u2011liability provisions that might appear elsewhere in the full agreement, which are not shown here).\n\n---\n\n### Why the liability appears uncapped in the excerpt\n\n| Clause / Section | What it says (relevant excerpt) | Implication for liability |\n|-------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| **Clause\u202f5 \u2013 Confidential Information** | \u2013 Obligates parties to keep information confidential and to use it only for permitted purposes.<br>\u2013 Lists the limited exceptions to confidentiality (performance, affiliates, listing rules, applicable law).<br>\u2013 No reference to a \u201cmaximum amount,\u201d \u201cliquidated damages,\u201d or any \u201ccap\u201d on damages for breach. | The confidentiality obligation is enforceable in its full extent; a breach would give rise to the usual common\u2011law or equitable remedies (injunctive relief, damages,",
