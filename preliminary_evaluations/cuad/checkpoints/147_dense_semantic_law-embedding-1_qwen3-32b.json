The user is asking about the duration of any warranty against defects or errors in technology, products, or services provided under the contract.

The amendment is dated December 9, 1996, and the sources are from an S-1/A filing from July 21, 1999.\n\nFirst, I need to check the provided context for any mention of warranties. The context includes the amendment to Section 2, Part B of the Co-Branding Agreement. The main part of the context is the amendment itself, which is about the Term. The agreement is between PCQ and ABW, and it's signed by Steven Malin and Howard Meltzer on December 5, 1996, and December 12, 1996, respectively.\n\nLooking through the text, the amendment is titled \"Amendment to Section 2 (titled 'Term'), Part B of the Co-Branding Agreement.\" The body of the amendment doesn't mention warranties, defects, errors, or any duration related to those. The only sections here are the parties involved, the effective date, and the signatures. There's no mention of warranties or their duration. The [***] might indicate that some parts of the document were redacted or omitted, but the user's question is about the warranty duration, which isn't covered in the provided context.\n\nSince the context doesn't include any information about warranties or their duration, the answer would be that the information isn't provided here. The user might need to refer to other sections of the original Co-Branding Agreement or other documents for warranty details. The amendment in question only deals with the Term, not warranties.\n</think>\n\nThe provided context does not specify the duration of any warranty against defects or errors in technology, products, or services under the contract.

      "question": "Is a party\u2019s liability uncapped upon the breach of its obligation in the contract? This also includes uncap liability for a particular type of breach such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality obligation.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the context provided in the Cooperation Agreement, there does not appear to be any uncapped liability for a party's breach of the contract. The agreement does not explicitly state that a party's liability is uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.\n\nThe relevant sections are:\n\n1. Clause 5 on Confidential Information, which states that the obligations of confidentiality shall remain in force until the relevant information enters the public domain otherwise than by the default of a party. This suggests there is no uncapped liability for breach of the confidentiality obligation.\n\n2. Clause 4.1 regarding QIWI's obligation to settle transactions through Otkritie's bank. This clause states that if QIWI terminates this obligation, it shall pay a fee to Otkritie, but this fee is capped at RUB 50,000,000. This indicates a cap on liability for breach of this specific obligation.\n\n3. The agreement does not contain any other provisions that suggest uncapped liability for breach of the contract or specific types of breaches. The dispute resolution clause (Clause 9) also does not indicate uncapped damages.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the Cooperation Agreement, the liability of the parties does not appear to be uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether a party's liability is uncapped in case of a breach of the contract, specifically mentioning IP infringement or breach of confidentiality. I need to look through the provided context to find any clauses that address liability limits.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the clauses mentioned. The context includes several sections: 3.6, 5.1, 5.2, 7.5, 7.6, 9.6, 9.7, 9.8, 9.9. The question is about liability, so maybe there's a liability clause in there. Let me check each section.\n\nLooking at 5.1 and 5.2, those are about confidentiality obligations. They mention that parties can't disclose confidential info except under certain circumstances. But there's no mention of liability limits here. \n\nSection 7.5 talks about assignment and transfer, so not relevant. 7.6 is about third-party rights. \n\nSections 9.6 to 9.9 are about arbitration. They state that arbitration awards are final and binding, and parties can bring proceedings to enforce them. Still not about liability caps.\n\nLooking back, maybe there's a liability clause in another part. The user provided context up to clause 9.9, but maybe there's a section about liability elsewhere. Wait, the context given doesn't include any explicit liability limitation clauses. The user's question is about whether liability is uncapped, which would mean the contract doesn't limit liability. If there's no clause stating that liability is capped, then by default, it's possible that liability is uncapped unless specified otherwise. However, in many contracts, especially in commercial agreements, there are usually liability caps unless stated otherwise. But in the absence of such a clause here, the answer would be that liability isn't capped. However, I need to check if any of the provided clauses imply a cap.\n\nLooking again, the confidentiality clause (5.1) doesn't mention liability limits. The arbitration clauses don't either. There's no mention of exclusions or limitations of liability in the given context. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, there's no indication that liability is capped. Therefore, the answer would be that the liability is uncapped because there's no clause limiting it. However, sometimes standard contract terms might include liability caps even if not mentioned here, but since the user",

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the contract contains a license grant to a licensee and their affiliates. The user is asking about a license grant, so I need to look through the provided context for any mention of licensing terms.\n\nFirst, I'll start by scanning the sections mentioned. The context includes several clauses like 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 21.3, and others. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nLooking at 3.10: It talks about the Distributor not actively promoting or selling Airspan Products outside the Territory without approval. However, it allows selling to customers outside the Territory if the request is unsolicited. This seems more about territorial restrictions rather than a license grant. The Distributor is allowed to sell but under certain conditions, but does that mean they have a license? Maybe not directly. It's about distribution rights, not necessarily a license to use the products.\n\nSection 3.11: The Distributor agrees not to represent competitors. This is a non-compete clause, so again, not a license grant.\n\nSection 3.12: They agree to negotiate a National Accounts Consulting Agreement by April 30, 2000. This would involve the Distributor getting consulting fees for selling Airspan's products. This might imply some rights to sell, but again, it's about consulting and commissions, not a license to use the products.\n\nSection 21.3: Talks about assignment and subcontracting needing prior written consent. If the Distributor wants to assign the agreement, they need approval. This is about transferring the contract, not licensing.\n\nThen there's the part about the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act compliance and indemnification. Not relevant here.\n\nLooking at 1.3: The Distributor must use best efforts to maintain and support products in the Territory. Also, a non-compete clause for three months after termination. Still, no mention of a license grant.\n\nThe question is about a license grant to a licensee and their affiliates. The key here is whether the Distributor is granted a license to use the products or to sublicense them. The contract mentions that the Distributor can sell or sublicense in response to unsolicited requests (3.10), but that's under the existing agreement. However, the main agreement doesn't explicitly state that the Distributor has a license to use the products. The Distributor's",

The key terms here are \"Agreement\" and \"Offering.\" The context refers to \"this Agreement\" which is being discussed in the context of renewal. The Offering is mentioned as part of the scenario where the Agreement might be renewed. \n\nLooking at the first part of the context, \"The Offering\" is mentioned, and then in the fourth point, the Bank is a member of FHLB-Dallas. But the main focus for the contract name is in Section 9. The phrase \"renew this Agreement\" suggests that the contract is referred to as an \"Agreement.\" However, the specific name might be tied to the Offering. \n\nSince the Offering is a key part of the context, and the Agreement is related to the Offering, it's possible that the contract is called the \"Offering Agreement.\" The mention of the Company, MHC, Bank, and Agent all being parties to the Agreement supports that. There's no explicit name given in the provided context, but the term \"Agreement\" is used in the context of the Offering. Therefore, the most logical answer is that the contract is the \"Offering Agreement.\"\n</think>\n\nThe contract referenced in the context is referred to as the **\"Agreement\"** in the text. However, based on the mention of \"The Offering\" and the parties involved (Company, MHC, Bank, and Agent), the full name of the contract is likely the **\"Offering Agreement\"** (or a similar variation, as the exact title is not explicitly stated in the provided context).

The context given includes sections about the Remarketing Agent's appointment, obligations, resignation, suspension, removal, conditions to obligations, and indemnification. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out what kind of contract this is. The mention of a \"Remarketing Agent\" makes me think of financial instruments, maybe something related to bonds or structured finance. Remarketing agents are often involved in maintaining the credit rating of a security by ensuring that the issuer meets its obligations, or by repurchasing the security if there's a default.\n\nLooking at the sections mentioned: Appointment and Obligations of the Remarketing Agent, Resignation, Suspension and Removal, Conditions to Obligations, Indemnification. These are typical clauses found in agreements where a third party is appointed to perform specific duties. The term \"Remarketing Agent\" is commonly used in the context of municipal bonds or commercial paper. \n\nIn municipal bonds, a remarketing agent might be responsible for repurchasing bonds if there's a default or for remarketing them to investors. Similarly, in commercial paper programs, a remarketing agent helps in selling the paper again if needed. The sections listed here align with the responsibilities and conditions under which such an agent operates.\n\nThe sections also mention Purchase Date and Remarketing Date, which could be specific dates related to the bond's terms or the agent's duties. The numbering of sections (like Section 6, 9, 10) suggests that this is part of a larger contract document, possibly a bond indenture or a credit facility agreement.\n\nGiven that the context is about the Remarketing Agent's obligations and related clauses, the contract is likely a \"Remarketing Agreement.\" This type of agreement outlines the terms under which the remarketing agent operates, including their appointment, duties, and the conditions under which they might be removed or replaced. \n\nAlternatively, it could be part of a \"Bond Purchase Agreement\" or \"Securities Purchase Agreement,\" but the specific mention of a Remarketing Agent points more towards a Remarketing Agreement. Another possibility is a \"Credit Support Agreement\" if the remarketing agent is providing credit support, but the term \"Remarketing\" is more specific.\n\nI should also consider if there's a standard name for such contracts in specific industries. For example, in the context of asset-backed securities, a remarketing agreement might be part of",

During the term of the franchise agreement, the franchisee agrees that neither it, its affiliates, nor its owners will have any direct or indirect interest in a \"Competitive Business\" located at the franchise site, within 3 miles of the franchise unit, or within 3 miles of any other Pretzel Time unit in operation or under development (Section 21.A).\n\n2. After termination or expiration of the franchise agreement, the franchisee and its owners agree not to have any direct or indirect interest in a Competitive Business located at the franchise site, within 3 miles of the franchise unit, or within 3 miles of any other Pretzel Time unit in operation or under development for a period of 12 months (Section 20.G).\n\nThe agreement also restricts the franchisee from recruiting or hiring any employees who were employed by Pretzel Time or another Pretzel Time franchisee within the prior 6 months, without Pretzel Time's prior written permission (Section 21.A(2)).\n\nSo in summary, the franchise agreement imposes non-compete and non-solicitation restrictions on the franchisee both during the contract term and for a period after the contract ends.",

The user is asking whether a party is restricted from contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty during the contract or after it ends. The context provided is a franchise agreement between Pretzel Time and a Franchisee.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the context for any clauses that mention restrictions on soliciting customers or partners. The main part here is the section where the Franchisee agrees not to have any interest in a Competitive Business within a certain radius. There's also a part about not recruiting employees who were employed by Pretzel Time or its units in the past six months without permission. \n\nThe question is about customers or partners, not employees. The context doesn't explicitly mention restrictions on soliciting customers. The non-compete clause is about owning or being involved in a competitive business, but not directly about soliciting customers. The non-solicitation of employees is there, but customers and partners aren't mentioned. \n\nLooking at the termination part, after the agreement ends, there's a 12-month restriction on Franchisee and their owners from doing certain things, but again, it's about not operating a competitive business, not about customers or partners. \n\nSo based on the provided context, there's no mention of restrictions on contracting or soliciting customers or partners. The restrictions are focused on ownership in competing businesses and employee recruitment. Therefore, the answer would be that the context doesn't restrict those actions.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: The provided context does not explicitly restrict a party from contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty during or after the contract. The agreement includes non-compete clauses (e.g., prohibiting ownership in competitive businesses within a 3-mile radius) and a non-solicitation provision for employees (within 6 months of employment), but there is no specific restriction on soliciting customers or partners. Post-termination restrictions are limited to a 12-month non-compete for the Franchisee and its affiliates, but again, no mention of customer/partner solicitation. Thus, based on the context, such restrictions are not explicitly imposed.",

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if there's an exclusive dealing commitment in the provided context. The context is an amendment to a co-branding agreement between PC Quote, Inc. (PCQ) and A.B. Watley, Inc. (ABW). The amendment is about Section 2, Part B, which is titled \"Term.\" The document mentions that the amendment is effective December 9, 1996, and includes signatures from both parties with dates of December 5 and 12, 1996.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what an exclusive dealing commitment entails. It usually means that one party agrees to buy all their needs from the other party, or not to work with others. The question is whether the amendment includes such a commitment. \n\nLooking at the provided context, the main content is the amendment to the Term section. The Term section typically outlines the duration of the agreement, any renewal terms, and possibly termination clauses. The amendment might be changing the length of the agreement or how it's renewed. However, the context doesn't include the actual text of the amendment beyond the title and the parties involved. The rest is about the effective date and signatures.\n\nThe user's question is about whether there's an exclusive dealing commitment. The key here is that the context provided is just the amendment's header and the signatures. There's no mention of exclusive dealing terms here. The Term section usually doesn't cover exclusivity in dealing; that's more likely in sections about obligations, procurement, or collaboration. Since the amendment is to the Term, it's probably about the duration rather than exclusivity. \n\nAdditionally, the sources cited are SEC filings (S-1/A), which are registration statements. These filings might include various agreements, but the excerpt provided doesn't show any details about exclusivity. Without more information from the actual amendment text, there's no indication of exclusive dealing commitments. \n\nTherefore, based on the given context, there's no evidence of an exclusive dealing commitment. The answer should be that there's no such commitment mentioned in the provided information.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: No, the provided context does not indicate an exclusive dealing commitment. The document describes an amendment to the \"Term\" section of a co-branding agreement, focusing on the duration or conditions of the agreement rather than exclusivity in procurement, licensing, or collaboration. There is no mention of obligations to procure all requirements from one party, prohib",
