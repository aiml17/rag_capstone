      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the context provided in the Cooperation Agreement, there does not appear to be any uncapped liability for a party's breach of the contract. The agreement does not explicitly state that a party's liability is uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.\n\nThe relevant sections are:\n\n1. Clause 5 on Confidential Information, which states that the obligations of confidentiality shall remain in force until the relevant information enters the public domain otherwise than by the default of a party. This suggests there is no uncapped liability for breach of the confidentiality obligation.\n\n2. Clause 4.1 regarding QIWI's obligation to settle transactions through Otkritie's bank. This clause states that if QIWI terminates this obligation, it shall pay a fee to Otkritie, but this fee is capped at RUB 50,000,000. This indicates a cap on liability for breach of this specific obligation.\n\n3. The agreement does not contain any other provisions that suggest uncapped liability for breach of the contract or specific types of breaches. The dispute resolution clause (Clause 9) also does not indicate uncapped damages.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the Cooperation Agreement, the liability of the parties does not appear to be uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.",

Any contract entered into by the Parties with a Marketer for the Product shall survive termination of the agreement in accordance with its terms, including any renewal rights provided therein (Section 10.1). \n\n3. Upon any breach by CAPSUGEL, CARDAX shall be permitted to use all Intellectual Property of CAPSUGEL used in the Formulation and the Product to the extent necessary for the development and marketing of the Product (Section 10.2).\n\n4. Upon any breach by CARDAX, CAPSUGEL shall be permitted to use all Intellectual Property of CARDAX used in the Active Ingredient and the Product to the extent necessary for the development and marketing of the Product in accordance with the terms of the agreement as of the date of such termination (Section 10.2).\n\n5.

In other words, obligations that are tied to that separate marketer agreement continue even after the master agreement ends.\n\n* **Continuing obligations** \u2013 The language \u201cin addition to the other obligations of the Parties hereunder\u201d signals that the parties remain bound by any other obligations that the agreement expressly states survive termination (e.g., confidentiality, indemnification, payment of accrued fees, etc.).\n\n* **Intellectual\u2011property ownership** \u2013 Each party retains ownership of the IP it creates, and the clause does not impose any further transfer obligation after termination unless the parties have separately agreed to do so.\n\n**Implication**\n\nTherefore, a party is still subject to certain post\u2011termination commitments, such as:\n\n* Returning the other party\u2019s property and confidential information within the 30\u2011day window.  \n* Honoring any separate marketer contracts that are expressly stated to survive termination.  \n* Performing any other obligations that the agreement itself identifies",
