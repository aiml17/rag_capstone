The context includes the amendment document, which is part of the Co-Branding Agreement. The main sections mentioned are the amendment to Section 2, Part B, titled \"Term.\" The Term section usually refers to the duration of the contract, not the warranty. The amendment was agreed upon by both parties with signatures dated December 5, 1996, and December 12, 1996, but the effective date is December 9, 1996.\n\nLooking through the text, there's no mention of warranties, defects, errors, or any duration related to those. The document is specifically about amending the Term section, which would relate to how long the agreement is in effect, not the warranty period for products or services. The sources cited are SEC filings (S-1/A), which are related to stock offerings and might include various agreements but don't necessarily detail every clause of the co-branding agreement beyond what's excerpted here.\n\nSince the context provided doesn't include any information about warranties or their duration, the answer would have to be that the information isn't available in the given context. The user might need to refer to other sections of the Co-Branding Agreement that aren't included here, such as sections dealing with warranties, representations, or indemnifications. Without that specific information, it's impossible to determine the warranty duration from the provided excerpt.\n</think>\n\nThe provided context does not include any specific information regarding the duration of a warranty against defects or errors in technology, products, or services under the contract.

      "question": "Is a party\u2019s liability uncapped upon the breach of its obligation in the contract? This also includes uncap liability for a particular type of breach such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality obligation.",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the context provided in the Cooperation Agreement, there does not appear to be any uncapped liability for a party's breach of the contract. The agreement does not explicitly state that a party's liability is uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.\n\nThe relevant sections are:\n\n1. Clause 5 on Confidential Information, which states that the obligations of confidentiality shall remain in force until the relevant information enters the public domain otherwise than by the default of a party. This suggests there is no uncapped liability for breach of the confidentiality obligation.\n\n2. Clause 4.1 regarding QIWI's obligation to settle transactions through Otkritie's bank. This clause states that if QIWI terminates this obligation, it shall pay a fee to Otkritie, but this fee is capped at RUB 50,000,000. This indicates a cap on liability for breach of this specific obligation.\n\n3. The agreement does not contain any other provisions that suggest uncapped liability for breach of the contract or specific types of breaches. The dispute resolution clause (Clause 9) also does not indicate uncapped damages.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the Cooperation Agreement, the liability of the parties does not appear to be uncapped upon breach of the contract or for specific types of breaches such as IP infringement or breach of confidentiality.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether a party's liability is uncapped in case of a breach of the contract, specifically mentioning IP infringement or breach of confidentiality. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the provided context to see if there's any mention of liability caps or uncapped liability. The context includes several clauses, mainly about confidentiality and bank services.\n\nStarting with the Confidential Information section (Clause 5.1 and 5.2). The main obligation here is not to disclose or use confidential information. There's a mention of obligations remaining in force until the info is in the public domain. But I don't see any specific mention of liability limits here. \n\nLooking at Clause 4.1 about Bank Services. It talks about QIWI's obligation to use a certain bank for transactions and a termination fee. The fee is capped at 50 million rubles. This is a specific example where liability is capped. However, the question is about whether liability is generally uncapped. The presence of a cap in one clause doesn't necessarily mean others are uncapped, but it's a data point.\n\nThe question also mentions IP infringement. The context doesn't discuss IP at all. So unless there's a standard clause elsewhere, the answer would depend on whether the contract has a general liability cap. \n\nLooking through the entire context provided, there's no mention of a general liability cap or uncapped liability. The only cap mentioned is in Clause 4.1's termination fee. Other breaches, like confidentiality, don't have a specified cap. Therefore, unless there's a separate clause limiting liability, the default would be that liability is uncapped. \n\nBut the user is asking if the liability is uncapped. Since the contract doesn't specify a cap for confidentiality breaches or IP issues, the answer would be that liability is not capped in those cases. However, the presence of a cap in another clause doesn't necessarily mean others are uncapped, but the absence of a cap in the relevant clauses (like confidentiality) implies that liability could be uncapped. \n\nSo the answer would be that the liability is not capped for breaches like confidentiality or IP infringement unless there's a specific cap mentioned elsewhere. Since the context doesn't mention such caps, the answer is yes, liability is uncapped for those breaches.\n</think>\n\nThe provided context does not explicitly state that a party\u2019s liability is capped in the event of a breach of confidentiality or other",

      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, according to the General Provisions of the Sponsorship Agreement, the Sponsor (Rubio's Fresh Mexican Grill) must obtain and continuously maintain certain insurance policies for the benefit of the counterparty, SDBF (San Diego Ballpark Funding LLC):\n\nSpecifically, Section 8(c) states that Sponsor must obtain and continuously maintain the following insurance policies:\n\n1. Workers' Compensation insurance with minimum liability limits.\n\n2. An occurrence-based Commercial General Liability Insurance Policy with minimum liability limits.\n\nThe policies must name SDBF, Padres LP, the City of San Diego, and their subsidiary/affiliated companies and directors/officers/employees as Additional Insureds. The policies must also contain Cross Liability Endorsements and a Waiver of Subrogation in favor of SDBF.\n\nSponsor must provide SDBF with certificates of insurance evidencing compliance with these insurance requirements prior to the commencement of the sponsorship and annually prior to the expiration of each required insurance policy.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if there's a requirement for insurance that one party must maintain for the benefit of the counterparty. The context provided is a legal document, probably a contract between SDBF and a Sponsor. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the context for any mentions of insurance requirements. The first part says that all policies must have a Waiver of Subrogation in favor of SDBF. That means the Sponsor has to get insurance that waives their right to subrogate against SDBF. So that's an insurance requirement for the Sponsor's benefit, but it's for SDBF's protection.\n\nThen there's a section where the Sponsor must obtain and maintain certain insurance policies at their own expense. Specifically, Workers' Compensation and Commercial General Liability Insurance. The Workers' Comp has to comply with California law and have minimum limits. The Commercial General Liability is an occurrence-based policy with specific coverage. These policies are required for the Sponsor, but are they for the benefit of the counterparty (SDBF)?\n\nLooking at the Waiver of Subrogation part again. A waiver of subrogation means that if an insured event happens, the insurance company can't go after the other party (SDBF in this case) for reimbursement. So the Sponsor's insurance is protecting SDBF. That's a key point. The Sponsor's insurance is in place to protect SDBF, which is the counterparty here.\n\nAlso, the Sponsor has to provide certificates of insurance to SDBF before the sponsorship starts and annually. This shows that SDBF is the beneficiary of these policies. The requirement for the Sponsor to maintain these policies is for SDBF's benefit. \n\nAdditionally, there's a part where if a claim is brought against the Padres Parties (which might include SDBF), the Sponsor has to defend the claim. This implies that the Sponsor's insurance is covering potential liabilities that could affect SDBF, so again, the insurance is for SDBF's benefit.\n\nSo putting it all together, the Sponsor is required to maintain specific insurance policies (Workers' Comp and General Liability) with certain terms, including a waiver of subrogation in favor of SDBF. These are maintained by the Sponsor for the benefit of SDBF, the counterparty. Therefore, the answer should confirm that yes, there is such a requirement.\n</think>\n\nYes, the Sponsor is required to maintain specific",

Let me scan through the context again.\n\nLooking at point 10: \"This Agreement shall be in effect until March 18. 2021, unless sooner terminated by either party upon (30) days written notice, without cause.\" So the initial term is until March 18, 2021.

      "question": "Does the contract contain a license grant to a licensee (incl. sublicensor) and the affiliates of such licensee/sublicensor?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "No, the contract does not contain a license grant to a licensee or the affiliates of such licensee. The contract grants Distributor (GLS LLC) a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use and sublicense the Software provided by Airspan, but it does not explicitly grant a license or rights to any affiliates of the Distributor.\n\nSpecifically, Section 11.1 states:\n\n\"Airspan grants Distributor, and Distributor hereby accepts, a nonexclusive, non-transferable license to use, and to sublicense as set forth below, Software provided by Airspan hereunder only on a single System or unit of Equipment, as may be applicable.\"\n\nThere is no mention of affiliates of the Distributor being granted any license or rights to the Software.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the contract contains a license grant to a licensee, including their affiliates. I need to check the provided context for any mention of licensing terms.\n\nLooking through the sections, section 4.1(a) mentions that the Distributor can license Software. The Purchase Order includes the Software the Distributor wants to license. Then in section 3.10, there's a part about not promoting or selling outside the Territory without approval, but it allows selling to customers outside if it's an unsolicited request. \n\nSection 6.1(b) talks about the fee for licensing the Software. Also, section 17.1 mentions Airspan indemnifying for infringement claims related to the Software. However, none of the sections explicitly state a grant of license to the Distributor's affiliates or sublicensees. The context refers to the Distributor licensing Software, but there's no mention of sublicensing rights or including affiliates in the license. \n\nThe question is about whether the contract includes a license grant to the licensee (Distributor) and their affiliates. The answer would depend on if there's a clause allowing the Distributor to sublicense or if affiliates are covered. Since the context doesn't mention anything about affiliates or sublicensing beyond the Distributor's own use, the answer is likely no. The Distributor can license the Software as per 4.1(a), but there's no indication that this extends to their affiliates or that they can sublicense.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: No, the contract does not explicitly contain a license grant to a licensee (including the Distributor) or their affiliates. The context specifies that the Distributor may license Software under the terms of the Purchase Order (Section 4.1(a)) and pay the Contract Price (Section 6.1(b)), but there is no provision indicating that the Distributor is granted a sublicense or that affiliates of the Distributor are included in the license. Additionally, Section 3.10 restricts the Distributor from sublicensing outside the Territory without Airspan's approval, implying that sublicensing rights are limited and conditional. The contract does not address licensing rights for affiliates of the Distributor.",

The user is asking for the name of the contract, so I need to look through the text to find any references that might indicate the title or name of the agreement.\n\nLooking at the context, there are several sections mentioned, like Section 12 and Section 13. The sections are part of a larger document. The first part mentions \"Tender and Paying Agent Agreement\" in Section 12, which says that the Fund can't amend the Tender and Paying Agent Agreement without the Remarketing Agent's consent. Then, later in the text, there's a mention of \"Tender Notice\" and references to \"VRRM-MFP Shares.\" \n\nAlso, at the end, there's a line that says \"This Agreement may be amended by any instrument in writing signed by all of the parties hereto...\" which suggests that the main document being discussed is an agreement between the Fund and the Remarketing Agent. The sections listed (like Section 12, 13, 23) are parts of this main agreement. \n\nThe title isn't explicitly stated in the provided context, but based on the content, it seems like the contract is a \"Remarketing Agreement\" or possibly a \"Tender and Paying Agent Agreement.\" However, since Section 12 refers to the \"Tender and Paying Agent Agreement\" as a separate document, the main contract here might be the \"Remarketing Agreement\" between the Fund and the Remarketing Agent. Additionally, the mention of \"VRRM-MFP Shares\" suggests that this is related to a specific type of security, possibly a municipal fund or similar.\n\nAnother clue is in the note about CUSIP numbers and the reference to Nuveen AMT-Free Municipal Credit Income Fund in the \"Cc\" line. This might be part of a larger set of documents, but the contract in question here is likely the one that includes sections about amendments, books and records, and benefits, which are typical in a remarketing agreement. \n\nPutting it all together, the contract is probably called the \"Remarketing Agreement\" between the Fund and the Remarketing Agent.

      "question": "Is a party subject to obligations after the termination or expiration of a contract, including any post-termination transition, payment, transfer of IP, wind-down, last-buy, or similar commitments?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, based on the information provided in the agreement, there are certain obligations that continue after the termination or expiration of the contract:\n\n1. The provisions of Sections 3.6, 4, 6, 8, 9 and 11 shall survive any termination of the agreement (Section 10.8).\n\n2. Any contract entered into by the Parties with a Marketer for the Product shall survive termination of the agreement in accordance with its terms, including any renewal rights provided therein (Section 10.1). \n\n3. Upon any breach by CAPSUGEL, CARDAX shall be permitted to use all Intellectual Property of CAPSUGEL used in the Formulation and the Product to the extent necessary for the development and marketing of the Product (Section 10.2).\n\n4. Upon any breach by CARDAX, CAPSUGEL shall be permitted to use all Intellectual Property of CARDAX used in the Active Ingredient and the Product to the extent necessary for the development and marketing of the Product in accordance with the terms of the agreement as of the date of such termination (Section 10.2).\n\n5. Each Party shall return to the other Party or to the other Party's designee no later than thirty (30) days after the effective date of termination all of such other Party's property, including all proprietary information, in its possession, except to the extent required to be retained by law or to comply with such Party's continuing obligations (Section 10.7).\n\nSo in summary, yes there are certain post-termination obligations, including the survival of certain provisions, the continuing effect of third-party contracts, and the return of proprietary information and materials.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether a party has obligations after the termination or expiration of a contract, including things like post-termination transitions, payments, IP transfer, etc. I need to look through the provided context to find relevant clauses.\n\nFirst, I remember seeing a section about returning property. Let me check section 10.7. It says that upon termination, each party must return the other's property, including proprietary information, within 30 days, except what's required by law or to meet ongoing obligations. So that's a clear post-termination obligation regarding returning property.\n\nThen there's 6.5 about recordkeeping. CAPSUGEL has to keep records for five years after the agreement ends. CARDAX can inspect them. So even after termination, CAPSUGEL must retain records, which is a post-termination obligation.\n\nLooking at the termination for breach part, if there's a breach, each party can use the other's IP for development and marketing. For example, if CAPSUGEL breaches, CARDAX can use their IP, and vice versa. This seems like a post-termination right that affects obligations.\n\nAlso, the Force Majeure clause says that delays due to certain events don't count as breaches. But does that affect post-termination? Maybe not directly, but it's about when termination happens. The No Waiver clause (10.6) states that not terminating for a breach doesn't mean future breaches are waived. That's more about how termination is handled rather than post-termination obligations.\n\nBankruptcy termination (10.3) allows immediate termination if the other party becomes bankrupt, but again, that's about when termination occurs, not after.\n\nSo putting it all together, the key points are returning property (10.7), retaining records (6.5), and IP usage rights upon breach. These are all obligations that continue after termination or expiration. The answer should mention these specific obligations.\n</think>\n\nYes, parties are subject to obligations after the termination or expiration of the contract, including post-termination requirements. Key obligations include:  \n\n1. **Return of Property**: Under **Section 10.7**, each party must return the other\u2019s property (e.g., proprietary information) within 30 days of termination, except as required by law or to fulfill ongoing obligations.  \n2. **Recordkeeping**: **Section 6.5** mandates",

Upon any breach by CAPSUGEL, CARDAX shall be permitted to use all Intellectual Property of CAPSUGEL used in the Formulation and the Product to the extent necessary for the development and marketing of the Product. Upon any breach by CARDAX, CAPSUGEL shall be permitted to use all Intellectual Property of CARDAX used in the Active Ingredient and the Product to the extent necessary for the development and marketing of the Product in accordance with the terms of this Agreement as of the date of such termination. 10.3 Termination for Bankruptcy .

      "question": "Is a party restricted from contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty, whether during the contract or after the contract ends (or both)?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, the franchise agreement contains restrictions on the franchisee's ability to compete with Pretzel Time, both during the term of the franchise agreement and after its termination or expiration.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n1. During the term of the franchise agreement, the franchisee agrees that neither it, its affiliates, nor its owners will have any direct or indirect interest in a \"Competitive Business\" located at the franchise site, within 3 miles of the franchise unit, or within 3 miles of any other Pretzel Time unit in operation or under development (Section 21.A).\n\n2. After termination or expiration of the franchise agreement, the franchisee and its owners agree not to have any direct or indirect interest in a Competitive Business located at the franchise site, within 3 miles of the franchise unit, or within 3 miles of any other Pretzel Time unit in operation or under development for a period of 12 months (Section 20.G).\n\nThe agreement also restricts the franchisee from recruiting or hiring any employees who were employed by Pretzel Time or another Pretzel Time franchisee within the prior 6 months, without Pretzel Time's prior written permission (Section 21.A(2)).\n\nSo in summary, the franchise agreement imposes non-compete and non-solicitation restrictions on the franchisee both during the contract term and for a period after the contract ends.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether a party is restricted from contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty during or after the contract ends, based on the provided context.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the context given. The main document here is a Third Party Assignment Agreement related to a Pretzel Time franchise. The key sections mentioned are 20.G. Covenant Not to Compete and definitions like Affiliate, Cart, Competitive Business, etc.\n\nLooking at section 20.G., it talks about a covenant not to compete after termination or expiration of the Agreement. The Franchisee and its Owners agree not to have any interest in a Competitive Business for 12 months. The restrictions apply to locations at the Site, within 3 miles of the Unit, or within 3 miles of any other Pretzel Time Unit in operation or under development. However, there's an exception for owning shares listed on a stock exchange up to 2%.\n\nThe question is about restrictions on contracting or soliciting customers or partners. The covenant not to compete section (20.G.) mentions restrictions on having any interest in a Competitive Business, but does it specifically mention soliciting customers or partners? The section says they can't have any direct or indirect interest in a Competitive Business in certain areas. It also states that the restrictions don't apply to owning small percentages of listed securities.\n\nBut the question is about soliciting customers or partners. The covenant here is about not engaging in a competitive business, not explicitly about soliciting. However, if the Competitive Business is defined as a business offering similar products, then being involved in such a business would inherently involve soliciting customers. But the exact wording of the covenant doesn't mention solicitation or contracting with customers or partners directly. It's more about ownership or involvement in a competitive business.\n\nAdditionally, the other definitions don't mention anything about non-solicitation clauses. The covenant is a non-compete, not a non-solicitation. So unless there's another part of the agreement that addresses this, the answer would be that the provided context doesn't mention restrictions on soliciting customers or partners. The covenant is about not operating a competitive business, not about contacting customers or partners.\n\nTherefore, based on the given context, the answer would be that the party is not restricted from contracting or soliciting customers or partners of the counterparty during or after the contract ends, as the covenant only addresses involvement in a competitive business",
