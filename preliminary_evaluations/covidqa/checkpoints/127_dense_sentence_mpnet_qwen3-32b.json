Wait, the titles and passages are a bit confusing. Let me check again.\n\nThe context has four entries. The first three are titled \"Estimating the number of infections and the impact of non-\" with the passage \"Lockdown\" each time. The fourth title is the same but the passage is \"banned Implemented with lockdown.57 24/3/2020\". Hmm, maybe there's a formatting issue here. The user might be referring to a study or report where lockdowns are discussed in the context of controlling infections.\n\nSo, the question is about defining a lockdown. The answer should be a general definition, but maybe the context implies something specific. However, the context seems fragmented. The key part might be the fourth passage mentioning \"banned Implemented with lockdown.57 24/3/2020\". Maybe \"banned\" is a typo for \"ban\" or another word. Alternatively, \"implemented with lockdown\" suggests that lockdowns are measures put in place, like restrictions on movement, closing businesses, etc.\n\nSince the user is asking for an answer based on the context, but the context is unclear, I should rely on general knowledge but also note the possible context. A lockdown typically refers to strict restrictions on movement and activities to prevent the spread of a disease, like during a pandemic. The context might be discussing how lockdowns affect infection rates compared to non-lockdown measures. The date 24/3/2020 could be when a lockdown was implemented, perhaps in a specific country.\n\nBut since the context is fragmented, the answer should be a standard definition, possibly mentioning that it's a public health measure to limit spread, enforced through restrictions. The user might be expecting that answer, even if the context is a bit unclear. I should make sure to define it clearly and concisely.\n</think>\n\nA **lockdown** is a public health measure implemented to restrict movement and activities of people in a specific area or nationwide, typically during a pandemic or health crisis, to slow the spread of infectious diseases. It often involves closing non-essential businesses, schools, and public spaces, limiting travel, and enforcing stay-at-home orders.

Let me look through the provided context to find all the mentioned complications.\n\nFirst, in the passage, it lists several complications from most common to least common. The main ones mentioned are respiratory failure, cardiovascular decompensation, meningoencephalitis, severe acute hepatitis, severe cutaneous effects, other central nervous system problems, and kidney failure. That's a good list to start with.\n\nThen there's a part about children being disproportionately affected. The context also talks about neonates and perinatal transmission. Specifically, it mentions that neonates can get CHIKV from their mothers during the perinatal period, leading to symptoms by day 4 of life. Some of them developed meningoencephalitis. Another study by Gerardin et al. reported neonatal infections progressing to encephalitis due to vertical transmission. So, encephalitis in newborns is another complication.\n\nAlso, there's a mention of fetal deaths when mothers were infected long before delivery, though only three cases were reported.

The answer would then be that Clade 1A contains 1,889 viruses from 34 countries collected from 2010 to the present. But the question specifically says \"Clade A,\" which isn't exactly in the text. However, since the nomenclature uses numbers and letters, perhaps \"Clade A\" is equivalent to the first-order clade 1A. The answer should clarify that based on the context provided, there's no direct mention of Clade A, but if they meant 1A, then the answer is as above. Alternatively, maybe there's a misinterpretation here. Let me check all the passages again to ensure I didn't miss any mention of Clade A. All the clades mentioned are numbered with 1A, 1B, 1C, etc., so perhaps the user made a typo or is using a different naming convention. Since the provided context doesn't mention a Clade A, the answer would have to state that there's no information on Clade A in the given context.

It also mentions the 1918 pandemic's herald waves possibly starting in 1915. However, this seems to be about multi-wave pandemics, not single-wave. So maybe not directly relevant, but perhaps there's something else here.\n\nThe second context is about the 2009 pH1N1 pandemic in Hong Kong. It mentions research on convalescent plasma treatment and studies on the origins and pathogenesis of the virus. However, the 2009 pandemic is noted to have multiple waves? Wait, the user is asking about single-wave. The passage here doesn't specify the number of waves for 2009, but the third context, which is about Taiwan's 2008-2014 influenza strains, specifically mentions the 2009 pH1N1 pandemic and uses a model for multi-wave epidemics. So maybe the 2009 pandemic had multiple waves? If that's the case, then the 2009 example isn't a single-wave. Hmm.\n\nThe fourth context discusses economic analysis of mitigation strategies for five pandemic severity categories, referencing studies that used individual-based models. It mentions the 2009 pandemic data for health outcomes. But again, the 2009 case isn't single-wave. The third context's passage about the Richards model variation is for multi-wave epidemics, so that's about handling multiple waves.\n\nThe first context's 1889 pandemic had three waves, so not single.

The user is asking for a number, so I need to look through the passages provided to find any specific numbers mentioned related to viral pneumonia.\n\nFirst, looking at the titles and passages. The first context mentions \"Primary influenza viral pneumonia\" and talks about attack rates during seasonal epidemics and pandemics. For example, during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in La Gloria, Veracruz, they mention clinical attack rates of 29% in adults over 15 and 61% in children under 15. But these are attack rates, not the actual number of cases. Attack rates are percentages, so without knowing the population size, we can't get an exact number from that.\n\nAnother passage from the \"Rapid advice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infected pneumonia\" states that as of January 26, 2020, there were 2744 confirmed cases of pneumonia with 2019-nCoV infection in China. This seems like a specific number. The question is about \"reported viral pneumonia,\" and since 2019-nCoV (now known as SARS-CoV-2) causes COVID-19, which can lead to pneumonia, these 2744 cases would be relevant. The passage also mentions 461 severe cases and 80 deaths, but the total confirmed cases are 2744.\n\nOther passages discuss bacterial co-infections in H1N1 cases, like 29% of 77 fatal cases had bacterial pneumonia. But that's about co-infections, not the total viral pneumonia cases. The question is about the number of reported viral pneumonia cases, so the 2744 from the 2019-nCoV context seems to be the direct answer. \n\nI need to check if there are any other numbers mentioned. The first context mentions percentages but not actual numbers. The other passages don't provide specific counts except for the 2019-nCoV one. So the answer should be 2744 confirmed cases of pneumonia with 2019-nCoV infection as reported by the National Health Commission in China on that date. The user might be referring to this",

This consistency would help in comparing results over time, which is important for tracking spread.\n\nThe third context, \"Visualizing Viral Infection In Vivo...\" discusses in vivo tracking using IVIS for whole-organ imaging and flow cytometry to analyze infection progression in antigen-presenting cells. They observed infection starting in the respiratory tract and spreading deeper. Also, they mention using multi-photon intravital microscopy for in vivo visualization. This is about tracking in live animals, not just cell cultures.\n\nThe last context about influenza viruses mentions similar in vivo tracking with IVIS and flow cytometry. Also, reporter genes like EGFP and mCherry allow long-term tracking due to strong expression and low bleaching. This supports the idea that fluorescent proteins are used for continuous monitoring.\n\nPutting this together, the spread was tracked using fluorescence microscopy techniques. In cell cultures, they used inverted fluorescence microscopes and high-content screening platforms to image GFP expression over time. In vivo, they used IVIS for whole-organ imaging and flow cytometry to monitor infected cells in different tissues. The consistent imaging settings and specific fluorescent markers allowed them to observe the progression from initial infection sites to spread in deeper tissues or different cell types.\n\nSo the answer should mention both in vitro methods (inverted fluorescence microscope, CellInsight platform, periodic imaging) and in vivo methods (IVIS, flow cytometry, multi-photon microscopy).

However, since the context is limited, the answer should stick to what's provided: immediate disinfection after the examination using proper sterilization procedures.\n</think>\n\nThe recommended procedure to disinfect a CT scanner after a COVID-19 exposure involves **immediately disinfecting the imaging equipment following the examination** using established sterilization protocols. This includes preparing the necessary disinfectants and ensuring thorough cleaning of the CT scanner to prevent cross-contamination. The context emphasizes prompt action post-examination to mitigate viral spread risks. Specific details about disinfectant types or dwell times are not provided in the given passages, but the core recommendation is to perform immediate, noncontaminated disinfection procedures after suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases.",
