Wait, the titles and passages mention \"Lockdown\" but the content isn't clear. The passage snippets are repetitive and cut off, like \"banned Implemented with lockdown.57 24/3/2020\". Hmm, maybe the context is from a research paper or report discussing lockdowns in the context of a pandemic, like COVID-19.\n\nSince the context is limited, I need to rely on general knowledge. A lockdown typically refers to a government-imposed restriction on movement and activities to control the spread of a disease. It involves closing non-essential businesses, schools, and public spaces, and people are required to stay at home except for essential needs. The context mentions the impact of non-lockdown, which might compare the effectiveness of lockdowns versus other measures. But since the user is asking for a definition, I should explain what a lockdown is in general terms, possibly mentioning its purpose and common measures. I should also note that the context might be related to a specific study, like during the 2020 pandemic, given the date mentioned (24/3/2020). However, since the provided context is minimal, the answer should be based on standard understanding unless the context provides more details. The user might be looking for a concise definition, so I'll keep it straightforward but informative.\n</think>\n\nA **lockdown** is a public health measure implemented by governments to restrict movement and gatherings of people in order to slow the spread of a contagious disease, such as during a pandemic. It typically involves closing non-essential businesses, schools, and public spaces, and requiring individuals to stay at home except for essential activities (e.g., medical care, grocery shopping). The goal is to reduce person-to-person transmission and prevent healthcare systems from becoming overwhelmed. \n\nThe context provided appears to reference studies analyzing the impact of lockdowns (e.g., estimating infections and comparing outcomes with non-lockdown strategies), such as those implemented during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.",

Viruses with identical or nearly identical genome sequences to those in the fall wave were circulating in early 1918 , at a time prior to the recognition of a new pandemic. It is perhaps not so great a leap to imagine that these viruses were related to\n\nTitle: The epidemiological and public health research response to 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1): experiences from Hong Kong\nPassage: of convalescent plasma to treat severe infections was shown to be feasible in a pandemic 57 and evidence of its effectiveness albeit from a small study should justify further studies. 56 While we focused on research into the epidemiology, impact, and control of pH1N1, much important research on pH1N1 has been carried out in other areas outside the scope of our review. To give two specific examples, local researchers confirmed the origins of the 2009 pandemic strain by comparison with a detailed local swine influenza surveillance program, 65 and performed important basic studies on pathogenesis. 66 Two sets of studies\n\nTitle: Economic analysis of pandemic influenza mitigation strategies for five pandemic severity categories\nPassage: Several related studies which also used individualbased simulation models of influenza spread coupled with costing models are those of those of Sander et al., Perlroth et al., Brown et al., and Andradottir et al. . The current study extends upon the scope of these studies in several ways: five gradations of pandemic severity are considered, more combinations of interventions are considered, social distancing interventions of varying durations are considered, and probabilities of severe health outcomes for each severity category are based on fatality, hospitalization and ICU usage data as observed from the 2009 pandemic. Also in contrast with those models,\n\nTitle: On Temporal Patterns and Circulation of Influenza Virus Strains in Taiwan, 2008-2014: Implications of 2009 pH1N1 Pandemic\nPassage: When there is more than one wave of infections, as in our current study, a variation of the Richards model can be utilized, which makes the distinction between two types of turning points ; one type which occurs at the peak incidence, and a second type which occurs in a multi-wave epidemic when the growth rate of the cumulative case number begins to increase again, indicating the beginning of the next wave."

Earlier and subsequent versions of this chart are maintained on a personal blog length coverage in a single experiment with highly repetitious measurement of each nucleotide position . Despite assays having been published early on, subgenomic sequencing, once the mainstay of viral outbreak studies, has less often been published during MERS-CoV\n\nTitle: MERS coronavirus: diagnostics, epidemiology and transmission\nPassage: Analyses of MERS-CoV genomes have shown that most single nucleotide differences among variants were located in the last third of the genome , which encodes the spike protein and accessory proteins . At least nine MERS-CoV genomes contained amino acid substitutions in the receptor binding domain of the spike protein and codons 158 , 460 , 1020 , 1202 and 1208 bear investigation as markers of adaptive change .

Among all humans reported to be infected, nearly 40 % have died. Continued laboratory testing, sequencing, analysis, timely data sharing and clear communication are essential for such vigilance to be effective.

While human and camel whole genome sequences have retained >99 % identity with each other, members of genetically distinct lineages can and do swap genetic material when suitable conditions and coinfections co-occur .
