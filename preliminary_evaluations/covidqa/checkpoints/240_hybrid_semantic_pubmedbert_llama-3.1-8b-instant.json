      "question": "What can RNA sequencing be used to monitor?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "RNA sequencing can be used to monitor transcripts that may not be in the existing genomic annotation, allowing the search for novel transcripts, and even identification of SNPs and other variants, as well as for transcriptome profiling in cancers such as breast cancer, gastrointestinal tumors, and prostate cancer.",
      "generated_response": "RNA sequencing can be used to monitor the magnitude of each RNA change, allowing the identification of canonical responses and novel interactions during influenza infections.",
      "retrieved_chunks": [
        "Alternatives to RNA sequencing are qRT-PCR and microarrays. The former is laborious and has a limited number of targets, while microarrays demand previously established transcriptomic probes and might have some background noise interfering on low abundant transcripts .",
        "Title: Personal genomes, quantitative dynamic omics and personalized medicine\nPassage: The development of RNA sequencing brought higher coverage, better precision and quantitation, and higher resolution and sensitivity, bringing RNA-Seq technology and transcriptomics on par with genomic sequencing . RNA-Seq considers reads that correspond to millions of transcriptomic fragments that are mapped to the reference genome, to provide information on transcripts that may not be in the existing genomic annotation, allowing the search for novel transcripts, and even identification of SNPs and other variants, while showing remarkable reproducibility .",
        "Spike-in controls can be used as quality control and also to estimate the absolute levels of RNA expression since in scRNA-seq the exact number of cells\n\nTitle: RNA Sequencing of H3N2 Influenza Virus-Infected Human Nasal Epithelial Cells from Multiple Subjects Reveals Molecular Pathways Associated with Tissue Injury and Complications\nPassage: changes to serve as potential reference markers of the innate responses of influenza infection.",
        "Given that RNAseq functions by reading virtually all the RNAs present in the samples tested, we can also discern the magnitude of each RNA change and mark them as the canonical responses. In addition, as RNAseq is not constrained by probe usage as in microarrays, they are therefore more reliable in detecting novel interactions during influenza infections of hNECs. Hence, RNAseq analysis will further augment the transcriptomic data established previously by microarray analysis.",
        "Once sequencing reads are obtained, low-quality bases, adaptors, and barcodes need to be trimmed before alignment."
