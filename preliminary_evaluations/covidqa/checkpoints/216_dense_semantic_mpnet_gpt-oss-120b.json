        "Alternatives to RNA sequencing are qRT-PCR and microarrays. The former is laborious and has a limited number of targets, while microarrays demand previously established transcriptomic probes and might have some background noise interfering on low abundant transcripts .",
        "Title: Personal genomes, quantitative dynamic omics and personalized medicine\nPassage: The development of RNA sequencing brought higher coverage, better precision and quantitation, and higher resolution and sensitivity, bringing RNA-Seq technology and transcriptomics on par with genomic sequencing . RNA-Seq considers reads that correspond to millions of transcriptomic fragments that are mapped to the reference genome, to provide information on transcripts that may not be in the existing genomic annotation, allowing the search for novel transcripts, and even identification of SNPs and other variants, while showing remarkable reproducibility .",
        "Transcriptome profiling has included looking at cancers , including breast cancer , gastrointestinal tumors and prostate cancer .",
        "Thus, the available gold standard method is scRNA-seq.",
        "Given that RNAseq functions by reading virtually all the RNAs present in the samples tested, we can also discern the magnitude of each RNA change and mark them as the canonical responses. In addition, as RNAseq is not constrained by probe usage as in microarrays, they are therefore more reliable in detecting novel interactions during influenza infections of hNECs. Hence, RNAseq analysis will further augment the transcriptomic data established previously by microarray analysis."
