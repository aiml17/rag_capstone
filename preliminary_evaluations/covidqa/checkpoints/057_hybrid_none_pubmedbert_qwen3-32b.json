The main ones are respiratory failure, cardiovascular decompensation, meningoencephalitis, severe acute hepatitis, severe cutaneous effects, other central nervous system problems, and kidney failure. That's a good list to start with.\n\nThen, in the third passage about the La Reunion Island outbreak, there's mention of neonates developing mengoencephalitis (probably a typo for meningoencephalitis). Also, there were fetal deaths reported. The fourth passage by Gerardin et al. talks about neonatal infections leading to encephalitis through vertical transmission. So adding encephalitis and fetal deaths as complications related to mother-to-child transmission.\n\nI should make sure to include both the general complications and those specific to neonates. The answer should list all the complications mentioned across the passages. Let me check again to ensure I didn't miss any. The first passage lists seven complications, and the others add encephalitis, fetal deaths, and maybe others. Also, the second passage just says \"and complications\" but no details, so probably not relevant.\n\nSo compiling all the complications: respiratory failure, cardiovascular decompensation, meningoencephalitis, severe acute hepatitis, severe cutaneous effects, other central nervous system problems, kidney failure, encephalitis (specifically in neonates), and fetal deaths. Also, the initial context mentions that severe CHIKF (Chikungunya fever) can lead to these complications, especially in high-risk groups like the elderly and those with underlying conditions. \n\nWait, the answer should just list the complications, not the risk factors.

The user is asking about \"Clade A,\" but looking through the passages, I notice that the main lineages mentioned are 1A, 1B, 1C, and others like 1A.1, 1A.1.1, etc. There's no mention of a \"Clade A\" specifically. The first passage talks about the 1A lineage being divided into three second-order divisions. The other passages discuss 1C and 1B lineages. The user might be confusing the nomenclature here. Since there's no Clade A mentioned, maybe they meant one of the first-order lineages like 1A? If that's the case, then according to the first passage, the 1A lineage contains 1,889 viruses from 34 countries collected from 2010 to the present. But since the question specifically says \"Clade A,\" which isn't referenced in the texts provided, the answer would be that there's no information on Clade A. Alternatively, maybe there's a typo and they meant 1A. I need to check if any of the passages refer to Clade A.

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking \"How many reported viral pneumonia?\" based on the provided context. I need to look through each of the given passages to find any numbers related to viral pneumonia cases.\n\nFirst, looking at the first context about the 2019-nCoV. The passage mentions 2744 confirmed cases of pneumonia with 2019-nCoV infection. That's a specific number related to viral pneumonia caused by that virus. The other numbers like suspected cases, close contacts, etc., don't directly answer the question about reported viral pneumonia cases. So that's one number: 2744.\n\nNext, the second context is about influenza viral pneumonia. It talks about bacterial co-infections in H1N1 cases. There's a mention of 77 fatal cases of pandemic H1N1v 2009 infection. However, the question is about reported viral pneumonia, not necessarily fatal cases. But the 77 is the number of fatal cases with H1N1, but does that count as reported viral pneumonia? The passage says \"77 fatal cases of pandemic H1N1v 2009 infection found a prevalence of concurrent bacterial pneumonia in 29%...\" So the 77 are H1N1 cases, which are viral, but the 29% had bacterial co-infection. The question is about viral pneumonia, so maybe the 77 is a number here. But the user is asking for how many were reported, so maybe the 77 is part of the answer. However, the first context's 2744 is definitely a direct answer for 2019-nCoV.\n\nThird context also discusses influenza attack rates, mentioning 29% and 61% in different age groups during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in La Gloria. But those are attack rates (percentage of population affected), not actual numbers of cases. So unless there's a specific number given for cases, this might not contribute to the answer. The passage says \"an analysis of the pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza A outbreak in La Gloria... found clinical attack rates of 29%...\" but no actual number of cases. So unless we know the population size, we can't derive a number from that.\n\nFourth context is about pneumonia in adults with seasonal influenza in the",

A total of 51 cases have been cured and discharged. At present, 5794 suspected cases were recorded, 32,799 with close contacts to the confirmed patients have been tracked, 583 people were released from medical observation that day, and 30,453 people were still undergoing medical observation.

A recent analysis of lung specimens from 77 fatal cases of pandemic H1N1v 2009 infection found a prevalence of concurrent bacterial pneumonia in 29% of these patients .

For example, an analysis of the pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza A outbreak in La Gloria, Veracruz, found clinical attack rates of 29% in adults older than 15 years and 61% in children younger than 15 years of age . However, these rates may be different in geographic areas of low population density.\n\nTitle: Pneumonia among adults hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed seasonal influenza virus infection\u2014United States, 2005\u20132008\nPassage: Patients with pneumonia ] were significantly more likely to receive influenza antiviral therapy than patients without pneumonia ; P <0.01]."

At least nine MERS-CoV genomes contained amino acid substitutions in the receptor binding domain of the spike protein and codons 158 , 460 , 1020 , 1202 and 1208 bear investigation as markers of adaptive change .

Among all humans reported to be infected, nearly 40 % have died. Continued laboratory testing, sequencing, analysis, timely data sharing and clear communication are essential for such vigilance to be effective.

While human and camel whole genome sequences have retained >99 % identity with each other, members of genetically distinct lineages can and do swap genetic material when suitable conditions and coinfections co-occur .

But the question is about tracking the spread, so maybe this isn't the main one.\n\nSecond context: The bat cell lines study. They used an inverted fluorescence microscope to monitor plates after applying an overlay. Once they saw GFP expression, they imaged a square subset of each well periodically using a CellInsight CX5 platform. The settings were standardized, with fixed exposure time. Images showed GFP cells in white and others in black. This seems like a method for tracking spread over time in cell cultures.\n\nThird context: Multi-photon intravital microscopy for in vivo visualization. They mention using cytoplasmic fluorescent proteins with specific promoters and that long-term tracking is possible due to strong expression. Also, visualization of small structures is feasible. This is about in vivo tracking, maybe in live animals.\n\nFourth context: Influenza viruses with reporter genes.

The passage says RNA-Seq provides info on transcripts not in existing annotations, novel transcripts, SNPs, and variants. It also mentions transcriptome profiling in cancers like breast, gastrointestinal, and prostate. So from here, RNA-seq can monitor transcriptomes, find novel transcripts, SNPs, and is used in cancer studies.\n\nSecond context is about automated identification of microorganisms.

Wait, the question is about RNA sequencing. The second context is more about DNA microarrays and PCR. Maybe not directly relevant unless there's a mention of RNA-seq.

It discusses scRNA-seq as the gold standard. It mentions alternatives like qRT-PCR and microarrays but highlights scRNA-seq. So RNA-seq here is used for single-cell transcriptomics, looking at different transcripts in individual cells. Also, the process involves trimming reads, using spike-ins for quality control.

To successfully use any method based on DNA or RNA detection, these assays must be coupled with large databases of nucleic acid sequence information for assay design to ensure that the desired information is provided and for the interpretation of raw data.

In addition, as RNAseq is not constrained by probe usage as in microarrays, they are therefore more reliable in detecting novel interactions during influenza infections of hNECs.
