        "Title: The origins of the great pandemic\nPassage: Because the 1889 pandemic unfolded with three major waves worldwide from 1889 to 1892 , with the 1892 wave being the most intense, at least on the East Coast of the USA, it seems worth considering whether so-called herald waves of the 1918 pandemic might have stretched back all the way to 1915. Viruses with identical or nearly identical genome sequences to those in the fall wave were circulating in early 1918 , at a time prior to the recognition of a new pandemic. It is perhaps not so great a leap to imagine that these viruses were related to\n\nTitle: The epidemiological and public health research response to 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1): experiences from Hong Kong\nPassage: of convalescent plasma to treat severe infections was shown to be feasible in a pandemic 57 and evidence of its effectiveness albeit from a small study should justify further studies. 56 While we focused on research into the epidemiology, impact, and control of pH1N1, much important research on pH1N1 has been carried out in other areas outside the scope of our review. To give two specific examples, local researchers confirmed the origins of the 2009 pandemic strain by comparison with a detailed local swine influenza surveillance program, 65 and performed important basic studies on pathogenesis. 66 Two sets of studies\n\nTitle: Economic analysis of pandemic influenza mitigation strategies for five pandemic severity categories\nPassage: Several related studies which also used individualbased simulation models of influenza spread coupled with costing models are those of those of Sander et al., Perlroth et al., Brown et al., and Andradottir et al. . The current study extends upon the scope of these studies in several ways: five gradations of pandemic severity are considered, more combinations of interventions are considered, social distancing interventions of varying durations are considered, and probabilities of severe health outcomes for each severity category are based on fatality, hospitalization and ICU usage data as observed from the 2009 pandemic. Also in contrast with those models,\n\nTitle: On Temporal Patterns and Circulation of Influenza Virus Strains in Taiwan, 2008-2014: Implications of 2009 pH1N1 Pandemic\nPassage: When there is more than one wave of infections, as in our current study, a variation of the Richards model can be utilized, which makes the distinction between two types of turning points ; one type which occurs at the peak incidence, and a second type which occurs in a multi-wave epidemic when the growth rate of the cumulative case number begins to increase again, indicating the beginning of the next wave."

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking \"How many reported viral pneumonia?\" based on the provided context. I need to look through each of the given passages to find any numbers related to viral pneumonia cases.\n\nFirst, looking at the first context about the 2019-nCoV. It mentions 2744 confirmed cases of pneumonia with 2019-nCoV infection as of January 26, 2020. That's a specific number related to viral pneumonia caused by that virus.\n\nNext, the second context is about influenza viral pneumonia. It talks about bacterial co-infections in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, with 29% of 77 fatal cases having bacterial pneumonia. But the question is about viral pneumonia, so maybe the 77 cases here are viral? Wait, the 77 cases are of pandemic H1N1v 2009 infection, which is viral. But the 29% figure refers to bacterial co-infections, not the total viral cases. The passage doesn't specify the total number of viral pneumonia cases here, just the co-infection rate. So maybe that's not helpful for the user's question.\n\nThird context also discusses influenza attack rates. It mentions 29% in adults and 61% in children during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in La Gloria. But again, these are attack rates (percentage of population affected), not the total number of cases. Without knowing the population size, we can't get an exact number here. So this might not help answer the question directly.\n\nFourth context is about pneumonia in adults with seasonal influenza in the US from 2005-2008. The passage states that patients with pneumonia were more likely to receive antiviral therapy. However, it doesn't provide a specific number of cases. The study might have looked at a certain number of patients, but the passage here doesn't mention the total number. So again, not helpful for the count.\n\nSo the only context that provides a specific number is the first one regarding 2019-nCoV, which reports 2744 confirmed cases. The other contexts discuss rates or percentages but not actual numbers. The user is asking for \"how many reported,\" which likely refers to the total number. Therefore, the answer should be 2744.",

A recent analysis of lung specimens from 77 fatal cases of pandemic H1N1v 2009 infection found a prevalence of concurrent bacterial pneumonia in 29% of these patients .

For example, an analysis of the pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza A outbreak in La Gloria, Veracruz, found clinical attack rates of 29% in adults older than 15 years and 61% in children younger than 15 years of age . However, these rates may be different in geographic areas of low population density.\n\nTitle: Pneumonia among adults hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed seasonal influenza virus infection\u2014United States, 2005\u20132008\nPassage: Patients with pneumonia ] were significantly more likely to receive influenza antiviral therapy than patients without pneumonia ; P <0.01]."

Earlier and subsequent versions of this chart are maintained on a personal blog length coverage in a single experiment with highly repetitious measurement of each nucleotide position .

At least nine MERS-CoV genomes contained amino acid substitutions in the receptor binding domain of the spike protein and codons 158 , 460 , 1020 , 1202 and 1208 bear investigation as markers of adaptive change . The spike protein had not changed in the recombinant MERS-CoV genome identified in China in 2015 but was reported to have varied at a higher rate than that for complete MERS-CoV\n\nTitle: MERS coronavirus: diagnostics, epidemiology and transmission\nPassage: Vigilance remains important for containment since MERS-CoV is a virus with a genetic makeup that has been observed for only three years and is not stable. Among all humans reported to be infected, nearly 40 % have died. Continued laboratory testing, sequencing, analysis, timely data sharing and clear communication are essential for such vigilance to be effective. Global alignment of case definitions would further aid accurate calculation of a case fatality ratio by including subclinical case numbers. Whole genome sequencing has been used extensively to study MERS-CoV travel and variation and although it remains a tool for experts, it appears\n\nTitle: MERS coronavirus: diagnostics, epidemiology and transmission\nPassage: Two studies during 2015, one looking at Jeddah-2014 MERS-CoV variants and another looking at a variant exported from South Korea to China, have now identified signs of genetic recombination among MERS-CoV variants. While human and camel whole genome sequences have retained >99 % identity with each other, members of genetically distinct lineages can and do swap genetic material when suitable conditions and coinfections co-occur .
