There's also a line that says \"banned Implemented with lockdown.57 24/3/2020\". Hmm, maybe that's a typo or a formatting issue. The user probably wants a definition of a lockdown based on the context given.\n\nSince the context mentions lockdown in the context of estimating infections and non-lockdown measures, it's likely discussing public health measures. A lockdown typically refers to strict restrictions on movement and activities to prevent the spread of a disease, like during a pandemic. The mention of \"non-lockdown\" suggests that the study is comparing the effects of implementing lockdowns versus not implementing them. The date 24/3/2020 might be when a lockdown was implemented in a specific region, like the UK or another country that started lockdowns around that time.\n\nPutting this together, a lockdown is a public health measure where authorities restrict people's movements and activities to reduce the spread of an infectious disease. The context implies that lockdowns are used to estimate their impact on infection rates compared to when they are not implemented. The answer should define lockdown in this public health context, mentioning restrictions on movement and activities, and possibly referencing the study's focus on their effectiveness in controlling infections.\n</think>\n\nA **lockdown** is a public health measure implemented to restrict movement and activities of people within a specific area to prevent the spread of an infectious disease, such as during a pandemic. It typically involves strict limitations on non-essential travel, closure of businesses, schools, and public spaces, and mandates for individuals to stay at home except for essential needs. The context provided suggests that lockdowns are studied to estimate their impact on reducing infections compared to scenarios where such measures are not enforced (\"non-lockdown\"). The mention of \"24/3/2020\" likely refers to the implementation date of a lockdown in a specific region during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

The main ones are respiratory failure, cardiovascular decompensation, meningoencephalitis, severe acute hepatitis, severe cutaneous effects, other central nervous system problems, and kidney failure.

Viruses with identical or nearly identical genome sequences to those in the fall wave were circulating in early 1918 , at a time prior to the recognition of a new pandemic. It is perhaps not so great a leap to imagine that these viruses were related to\n\nTitle: The epidemiological and public health research response to 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1): experiences from Hong Kong\nPassage: of convalescent plasma to treat severe infections was shown to be feasible in a pandemic 57 and evidence of its effectiveness albeit from a small study should justify further studies. 56 While we focused on research into the epidemiology, impact, and control of pH1N1, much important research on pH1N1 has been carried out in other areas outside the scope of our review. To give two specific examples, local researchers confirmed the origins of the 2009 pandemic strain by comparison with a detailed local swine influenza surveillance program, 65 and performed important basic studies on pathogenesis. 66 Two sets of studies\n\nTitle: Economic analysis of pandemic influenza mitigation strategies for five pandemic severity categories\nPassage: Several related studies which also used individualbased simulation models of influenza spread coupled with costing models are those of those of Sander et al., Perlroth et al., Brown et al., and Andradottir et al. . The current study extends upon the scope of these studies in several ways: five gradations of pandemic severity are considered, more combinations of interventions are considered, social distancing interventions of varying durations are considered, and probabilities of severe health outcomes for each severity category are based on fatality, hospitalization and ICU usage data as observed from the 2009 pandemic. Also in contrast with those models,\n\nTitle: On Temporal Patterns and Circulation of Influenza Virus Strains in Taiwan, 2008-2014: Implications of 2009 pH1N1 Pandemic\nPassage: When there is more than one wave of infections, as in our current study, a variation of the Richards model can be utilized, which makes the distinction between two types of turning points ; one type which occurs at the peak incidence, and a second type which occurs in a multi-wave epidemic when the growth rate of the cumulative case number begins to increase again, indicating the beginning of the next wave."

At least nine MERS-CoV genomes contained amino acid substitutions in the receptor binding domain of the spike protein and codons 158 , 460 , 1020 , 1202 and 1208 bear investigation as markers of adaptive change .

Continued laboratory testing, sequencing, analysis, timely data sharing and clear communication are essential for such vigilance to be effective.

While human and camel whole genome sequences have retained >99 % identity with each other, members of genetically distinct lineages can and do swap genetic material when suitable conditions and coinfections co-occur .
