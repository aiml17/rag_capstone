Since the context doesn't provide much, I need to rely on general knowledge. A lockdown is a public health measure where people are required to stay at home to prevent the spread of a disease, like during a pandemic. It restricts movement and gatherings. The context mentions non-lockdown impact, so maybe comparing scenarios with and without lockdowns. But the answer should define lockdown clearly, even if the context is minimal.

The user is asking about Clade A, but looking through the passages, I notice mentions of clades like 1A, 1B, 1C, and their subclades such as 1A.1, 1B.1.1, etc. The question specifically mentions \"Clade A,\" but the context uses numerical designations like 1A, 1B, etc. Maybe there's a typo or confusion in the question. Let me check the titles and passages again.\n\nThe titles and passages discuss a phylogeny-based nomenclature system for H1 hemagglutinin genes in swine influenza A viruses. The clades are numbered with a structure like 1A, 1B, 1C, and further subdivisions. For example, the 1A lineage is split into three second-order divisions.

Perhaps the user meant 1A. Let me check if there's any mention of Clade A in the provided text. Scanning through the titles and passages, I don't see \"Clade A\" explicitly; all references are to 1A, 1B, 1C. The answer might be that there's no Clade A, but rather 1A, which contains viruses from multiple countries, as per the 1A lineage description. The 1A lineage had 1,889 viruses from 34 countries collected from 2010 to the present. It was divided into three second-order divisions. So if the question intended to ask about 1A, then the answer would be that Clade 1A contains those viruses. However, since the question says \"Clade A,\" maybe there's a misunderstanding.

I need to look through the provided contexts to find relevant information.\n\nFirst, looking at the first context titled \"The origins of the great pandemic,\" it discusses the 1889 pandemic with three major waves, including the 1892 wave being the most intense. However, the question is about single-wave pandemics. This context might not be directly relevant, but it mentions the 1918 pandemic's herald waves possibly starting in 1915. But since the 1918 pandemic is known for multiple waves, maybe this isn't helpful here.\n\nNext, the second context is about the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in Hong Kong. It talks about research on convalescent plasma and studies on the origins of the strain. However, the 2009 pandemic had multiple waves as well, so again, not a single-wave example.\n\nThe third context discusses economic analysis of mitigation strategies for pandemics with five severity categories. It references studies using simulation models and data from the 2009 pandemic. But again, the 2009 pandemic wasn't a single wave. The context mentions considering varying durations of social distancing, but doesn't specify single-wave pandemics.\n\nThe fourth context is about influenza virus circulation in Taiwan, mentioning a multi-wave epidemic and using a Richards model to analyze waves. This seems to focus on multi-wave scenarios, not single-wave.\n\nWait, the user is asking about severe, single-wave pandemics. None of the provided contexts explicitly mention a single-wave pandemic. The 1889 pandemic had three waves, 1918 had multiple waves, 2009 also had multiple waves. The contexts don't discuss a severe pandemic that was contained in a single wave. However, maybe there's something in the economic analysis context? The third context talks about five pandemic severity categories but doesn't specify single-wave. \n\nHmm, perhaps the answer is that the research mentioned in the contexts doesn't focus on single-wave pandemics. The examples given (1889, 1918, 2009) all had multiple waves. The answer might need to state that the provided contexts don't discuss single-wave pandemics but mention studies on multi-wave pandemics and mitigation strategies. Alternatively, maybe the 18",
