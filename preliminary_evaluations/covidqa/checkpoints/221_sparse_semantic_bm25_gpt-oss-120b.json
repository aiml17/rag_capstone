This helps dilute any aerosolised virus before surface cleaning.\n\n3. **Remove and contain disposable items**  \n   * Discard any single\u2011use items (e.g., paper drapes, disposable covers) in a sealed biohazard bag.  \n   * Place any reusable items (e.g., positioning aids) in a designated \u201ccontaminated\u201d container for later decontamination.\n\n4. **Surface disinfection \u2013 high\u2011touch areas**  \n   * Using a **WHO\u2011/CDC\u2011approved disinfectant** (e.g., 0.1\u202f% sodium hypochlorite, 70\u202f% ethanol, or a hospital\u2011grade quaternary\u2011ammonium solution with proven activity against SARS\u2011CoV\u20112), wipe **all** of the following:  \n     - Patient table top and side rails  \n     - Table\u2011movement controls and hand\u2011grips  \n     - Gantry exterior, especially the patient entry/exit doors and handles  \n     - Console keyboard, mouse, touch screen, and any control panels  \n     - C",

        "Alternatives to RNA sequencing are qRT-PCR and microarrays. The former is laborious and has a limited number of targets, while microarrays demand previously established transcriptomic probes and might have some background noise interfering on low abundant transcripts .",
        "Given that RNAseq functions by reading virtually all the RNAs present in the samples tested, we can also discern the magnitude of each RNA change and mark them as the canonical responses. In addition, as RNAseq is not constrained by probe usage as in microarrays, they are therefore more reliable in detecting novel interactions during influenza infections of hNECs. Hence, RNAseq analysis will further augment the transcriptomic data established previously by microarray analysis."
