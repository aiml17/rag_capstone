Wait, the titles and passages mention \"Lockdown\" and \"banned Implemented with lockdown.57 24/3/2020\". Hmm, maybe the context is related to a study or report about lockdowns during a pandemic, like COVID-19.\n\nFirst, I need to define what a lockdown is. A lockdown is a public health measure where authorities restrict movement and gatherings to control the spread of a disease. The context mentions \"non-lockdown\" and \"implemented with lockdown,\" which suggests comparing scenarios with and without lockdowns. The date 24/3/2020 might refer to when a lockdown was enforced, possibly in a specific country or region.\n\nThe user might be looking for a clear, concise definition. Since the context is about estimating infections, the answer should connect lockdowns to their purpose in reducing transmission. I should mention that lockdowns aim to limit social interactions, close non-essential businesses, and enforce stay-at-home orders. Also, note that the context's date aligns with early pandemic measures, like in March 2020 when many countries first implemented lockdowns.\n\nI need to ensure the answer is accurate and ties into the provided context. Avoid adding information not in the context, but use the context to support the definition. The repeated titles and passages might be a formatting error, but the key points are about lockdown implementation and its impact on infections.\n</think>\n\nA **lockdown** is a public health measure implemented by authorities to restrict movement and gatherings of people in order to slow the spread of a contagious disease, such as during a pandemic. It typically involves closing non-essential businesses, schools, and public spaces, limiting travel, and enforcing stay-at-home orders. The context provided references the implementation of lockdown measures (e.g., \"banned Implemented with lockdown.57 24/3/2020\") to estimate their impact on reducing infections, likely in response to an outbreak like the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020.",

They used intranasal inoculation and checked percentages of GFP+ cells in different cell types at 48h. Also, multi-photon intravital microscopy for in vivo tracking.
