It typically involves closing schools, businesses, and public venues; prohibiting gatherings; and requiring residents to stay at home except for essential activities such as obtaining food, medical care, or working in critical services. The goal is to reduce person\u2011to\u2011person contact, thereby slowing transmission and preventing the health\u2011care system from becoming overwhelmed.",
