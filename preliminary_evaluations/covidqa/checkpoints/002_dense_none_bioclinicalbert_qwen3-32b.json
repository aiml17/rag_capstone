Wait, the titles all mention \"Lockdown\" but the passages are either empty or just \"Lockdown\" again. The only other info is a date and \"banned Implemented with lockdown.57 24/3/2020\". Hmm, that's a bit confusing.\n\nFirst, I need to define \"lockdown\" based on general knowledge since the context isn't very helpful. A lockdown typically refers to strict restrictions on movement and activities imposed by authorities to control the spread of a disease, like during a pandemic. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries implemented lockdowns to limit social interactions and reduce transmission rates.\n\nBut the user's context mentions \"non-lockdown\" and the impact, so maybe they're comparing scenarios with and without lockdowns. The answer should probably explain what a lockdown is in the context of public health measures. Since the provided context is minimal, I should rely on common definitions. Also, the date 24/3/2020 might be when a lockdown was implemented somewhere, but without more info, it's hard to say. The answer should be concise, clear, and based on standard definitions.\n</think>\n\nA **lockdown** is a public health measure implemented by authorities to restrict movement and gatherings of people, typically during a pandemic or outbreak, to slow the spread of a contagious disease. It often involves closing non-essential businesses, schools, and public spaces, limiting travel, and enforcing strict social distancing. The goal is to reduce person-to-person transmission and prevent healthcare systems from becoming overwhelmed. Lockdowns are usually enforced through legal mandates and monitored to ensure compliance.",

The user is asking about \"Clade A,\" but looking through the passages, I notice that the main lineages mentioned are 1A, 1B, 1C, and others like 1A.1, 1A.1.1, etc. The question mentions \"Clade A,\" but the passages don't refer to a clade labeled simply as \"A.\" Instead, they talk about 1A, 1B, 1C lineages.\n\nWait, maybe there's a confusion in the labeling.

Viruses with identical or nearly identical genome sequences to those in the fall wave were circulating in early 1918 , at a time prior to the recognition of a new pandemic. It is perhaps not so great a leap to imagine that these viruses were related to\n\nTitle: The epidemiological and public health research response to 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1): experiences from Hong Kong\nPassage: of convalescent plasma to treat severe infections was shown to be feasible in a pandemic 57 and evidence of its effectiveness albeit from a small study should justify further studies. 56 While we focused on research into the epidemiology, impact, and control of pH1N1, much important research on pH1N1 has been carried out in other areas outside the scope of our review. To give two specific examples, local researchers confirmed the origins of the 2009 pandemic strain by comparison with a detailed local swine influenza surveillance program, 65 and performed important basic studies on pathogenesis. 66 Two sets of studies\n\nTitle: Economic analysis of pandemic influenza mitigation strategies for five pandemic severity categories\nPassage: Several related studies which also used individualbased simulation models of influenza spread coupled with costing models are those of those of Sander et al., Perlroth et al., Brown et al., and Andradottir et al. . The current study extends upon the scope of these studies in several ways: five gradations of pandemic severity are considered, more combinations of interventions are considered, social distancing interventions of varying durations are considered, and probabilities of severe health outcomes for each severity category are based on fatality, hospitalization and ICU usage data as observed from the 2009 pandemic. Also in contrast with those models,\n\nTitle: On Temporal Patterns and Circulation of Influenza Virus Strains in Taiwan, 2008-2014: Implications of 2009 pH1N1 Pandemic\nPassage: When there is more than one wave of infections, as in our current study, a variation of the Richards model can be utilized, which makes the distinction between two types of turning points ; one type which occurs at the peak incidence, and a second type which occurs in a multi-wave epidemic when the growth rate of the cumulative case number begins to increase again, indicating the beginning of the next wave."

The fourth passage talks about pneumonia in adults with seasonal influenza but again, doesn't provide a total number of viral pneumonia cases beyond the context of the study in the US from 2005-2008, which isn't a specific count.\n\nSo the only passage that gives a specific number is the first one about 2019-nCoV. The question is about \"reported viral pneumonia,\" and since 2019-nCoV causes viral pneumonia, the 2744 confirmed cases would be the answer here.

Earlier and subsequent versions of this chart are maintained on a personal blog length coverage in a single experiment with highly repetitious measurement of each nucleotide position . Despite assays having been published early on, subgenomic sequencing, once the mainstay of viral outbreak studies, has less often been published during MERS-CoV\n\nTitle: MERS coronavirus: diagnostics, epidemiology and transmission\nPassage: Analyses of MERS-CoV genomes have shown that most single nucleotide differences among variants were located in the last third of the genome , which encodes the spike protein and accessory proteins . At least nine MERS-CoV genomes contained amino acid substitutions in the receptor binding domain of the spike protein and codons 158 , 460 , 1020 , 1202 and 1208 bear investigation as markers of adaptive change . The spike protein had not changed in the recombinant MERS-CoV genome identified in China in 2015 but was reported to have varied at a higher rate than that for complete MERS-CoV\n\nTitle: MERS coronavirus: diagnostics, epidemiology and transmission\nPassage: Vigilance remains important for containment since MERS-CoV is a virus with a genetic makeup that has been observed for only three years and is not stable. Among all humans reported to be infected, nearly 40 % have died. Continued laboratory testing, sequencing, analysis, timely data sharing and clear communication are essential for such vigilance to be effective. Global alignment of case definitions would further aid accurate calculation of a case fatality ratio by including subclinical case numbers. Whole genome sequencing has been used extensively to study MERS-CoV travel and variation and although it remains a tool for experts, it appears\n\nTitle: MERS coronavirus: diagnostics, epidemiology and transmission\nPassage: Two studies during 2015, one looking at Jeddah-2014 MERS-CoV variants and another looking at a variant exported from South Korea to China, have now identified signs of genetic recombination among MERS-CoV variants. While human and camel whole genome sequences have retained >99 % identity with each other, members of genetically distinct lineages can and do swap genetic material when suitable conditions and coinfections co-occur .
