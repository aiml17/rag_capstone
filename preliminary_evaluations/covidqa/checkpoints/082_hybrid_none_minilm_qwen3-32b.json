Wait, the titles and passages mention \"Lockdown\" and \"banned Implemented with lockdown.57 24/3/2020\". Hmm, maybe the context is from a study or report discussing lockdowns during a pandemic, like COVID-19.\n\nFirst, I need to define \"lockdown\" based on the given context. The context might be referring to government-imposed restrictions to limit movement and gatherings to control the spread of a disease. The mention of \"non-lockdown\" suggests that the study compares areas with and without lockdowns. The date 24/3/2020 is significant because that's when many countries started implementing lockdowns during the early stages of the pandemic.\n\nSince the user wants the answer based on the provided context, I should focus on the information given here. The context titles talk about estimating infections and the impact of non-lockdown, so the lockdown here is likely a public health measure. The passage mentions \"banned Implemented with lockdown,\" which might mean that certain activities were banned as part of the lockdown. \n\nPutting it all together, a lockdown is a set of strict measures enforced by authorities to restrict people's movements and activities to prevent the spread of an infectious disease. The context implies that lockdowns are used to reduce infections by limiting social interactions. The answer should be concise, using the context provided without adding external information. I need to make sure not to include any details beyond what's in the given context, even if I know more about lockdowns from general knowledge.\n</think>\n\nA lockdown is a public health measure implemented by authorities to restrict movement and activities of individuals or groups, typically during a pandemic, to reduce the spread of an infectious disease.

        "Title: The origins of the great pandemic\nPassage: Because the 1889 pandemic unfolded with three major waves worldwide from 1889 to 1892 , with the 1892 wave being the most intense, at least on the East Coast of the USA, it seems worth considering whether so-called herald waves of the 1918 pandemic might have stretched back all the way to 1915. Viruses with identical or nearly identical genome sequences to those in the fall wave were circulating in early 1918 , at a time prior to the recognition of a new pandemic. It is perhaps not so great a leap to imagine that these viruses were related to\n\nTitle: The epidemiological and public health research response to 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1): experiences from Hong Kong\nPassage: of convalescent plasma to treat severe infections was shown to be feasible in a pandemic 57 and evidence of its effectiveness albeit from a small study should justify further studies. 56 While we focused on research into the epidemiology, impact, and control of pH1N1, much important research on pH1N1 has been carried out in other areas outside the scope of our review. To give two specific examples, local researchers confirmed the origins of the 2009 pandemic strain by comparison with a detailed local swine influenza surveillance program, 65 and performed important basic studies on pathogenesis. 66 Two sets of studies\n\nTitle: Economic analysis of pandemic influenza mitigation strategies for five pandemic severity categories\nPassage: Several related studies which also used individualbased simulation models of influenza spread coupled with costing models are those of those of Sander et al., Perlroth et al., Brown et al., and Andradottir et al. . The current study extends upon the scope of these studies in several ways: five gradations of pandemic severity are considered, more combinations of interventions are considered, social distancing interventions of varying durations are considered, and probabilities of severe health outcomes for each severity category are based on fatality, hospitalization and ICU usage data as observed from the 2009 pandemic. Also in contrast with those models,\n\nTitle: On Temporal Patterns and Circulation of Influenza Virus Strains in Taiwan, 2008-2014: Implications of 2009 pH1N1 Pandemic\nPassage: When there is more than one wave of infections, as in our current study, a variation of the Richards model can be utilized, which makes the distinction between two types of turning points ; one type which occurs at the peak incidence, and a second type which occurs in a multi-wave epidemic when the growth rate of the cumulative case number begins to increase again, indicating the beginning of the next wave."

It mentions 2744 confirmed cases as of January 26, 2020. That's a specific number related to viral pneumonia caused by this virus. The other contexts are about influenza. The second and third passages discuss bacterial co-infections in H1N1 cases and attack rates during pandemics, but they don't give specific numbers of reported cases. The fourth passage talks about pneumonia in adults with seasonal influenza but again doesn't provide a total number. \n\nThe question is asking for the number of reported viral pneumonia cases. The only context that provides a specific number is the first one regarding 2019-nCoV. The other contexts are about influenza but don't mention total reported cases. Since the user is asking for \"viral pneumonia\" in general, but the contexts only have specific data for 2019-nCoV and some influenza stats without exact numbers, the answer should be based on the first context.

For example, an analysis of the pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza A outbreak in La Gloria, Veracruz, found clinical attack rates of 29% in adults older than 15 years and 61% in children younger than 15 years of age .

Earlier and subsequent versions of this chart are maintained on a personal blog length coverage in a single experiment with highly repetitious measurement of each nucleotide position .

At least nine MERS-CoV genomes contained amino acid substitutions in the receptor binding domain of the spike protein and codons 158 , 460 , 1020 , 1202 and 1208 bear investigation as markers of adaptive change . The spike protein had not changed in the recombinant MERS-CoV genome identified in China in 2015 but was reported to have varied at a higher rate than that for complete MERS-CoV\n\nTitle: MERS coronavirus: diagnostics, epidemiology and transmission\nPassage: Vigilance remains important for containment since MERS-CoV is a virus with a genetic makeup that has been observed for only three years and is not stable. Among all humans reported to be infected, nearly 40 % have died. Continued laboratory testing, sequencing, analysis, timely data sharing and clear communication are essential for such vigilance to be effective. Global alignment of case definitions would further aid accurate calculation of a case fatality ratio by including subclinical case numbers. Whole genome sequencing has been used extensively to study MERS-CoV travel and variation and although it remains a tool for experts, it appears\n\nTitle: MERS coronavirus: diagnostics, epidemiology and transmission\nPassage: Two studies during 2015, one looking at Jeddah-2014 MERS-CoV variants and another looking at a variant exported from South Korea to China, have now identified signs of genetic recombination among MERS-CoV variants. While human and camel whole genome sequences have retained >99 % identity with each other, members of genetically distinct lineages can and do swap genetic material when suitable conditions and coinfections co-occur .

This implies in vivo tracking using intravital microscopy.\n\nFourth context: They used IVIS for whole-organ imaging of lungs ex vivo and flow cytometry to analyze infection progression in antigen-presenting cells.
