Then, in the passage, there's a list of complications from most common to least common. The list includes respiratory failure, cardiovascular decompensation, meningoencephalitis, severe acute hepatitis, severe cutaneous effects, other central nervous system problems, and kidney failure. Also, another part mentions that vertical transmission from mothers can lead to encephalitis in neonates. Additionally, there's a study by Gerardin et al. that reports neonatal infections leading to encephalitis due to vertical transmission. \n\nWait, I need to make sure I don't miss any. The answer should list all the complications mentioned across the provided texts. Let me check again. The main list is respiratory failure, cardiovascular decompensation, meningoencephalitis, severe acute hepatitis, severe cutaneous effects, other central nervous system problems, and kidney failure. Also, the neonatal cases specifically mention meningoencephalitis and encephalitis. Are those considered separate or part of the central nervous system problems? The passage says \"other central nervous system problems,\" so maybe encephalitis is included there. Also, the context says six neonates developed meningoencephalitis.

The passages talk about the 1A lineage, which is divided into three second-order divisions. The 1A lineage has 1,889 viruses from 34 countries.

The answer might be that there's no Clade A, but perhaps the user meant 1A. However, since the user wrote \"Clade A,\" maybe there's a misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe in the context of the 1A lineage, there's a Clade A within it?

The context mentions that the S1 subunit of 2019-nCoV shares around 70% identity with the two bat SARS-like CoVs and human SARS-CoV. However, the core domain of the RBD is highly conserved. But the external subdomain of the RBD in 2019-nCoV has only 40% amino acid identity with other SARS-related coronaviruses.

The key point here is that they did research on pH1N1, but the question is about single-wave. The passage doesn't explicitly say if the 2009 pandemic was single or multi-wave. However, the third context, which is about Taiwan's 2009 pH1N1 pandemic, mentions \"more than one wave of infections\" in their study. So the 2009 pandemic had multiple waves. Therefore, this context might not be relevant for single-wave.\n\nThe third context's passage discusses a study using a Richards model variation for multi-wave epidemics, which again is about multiple waves, not single. The fourth context is about economic analysis of mitigation strategies for five pandemic severity categories, referencing studies that used simulation models. It mentions extending previous studies by considering five severity categories and various interventions. However, it's focused on modeling and economic aspects, not specifically on single-wave pandemics.\n\nSo, looking across all contexts, there's a lot about multi-wave pandemics (like 1889, 1918, 2009), but the question is about severe, single-wave pandemics.

Transcriptome profiling has included looking at cancers , including breast cancer , gastrointestinal tumors and prostate cancer . Title: Automated identification of multiple micro-organisms from resequencing DNA microarrays\nPassage: For both surveillance and diagnostic applications, fine-scale pathogen identification and near-neighbor discrimination is important; therefore, an assay that monitors at this very specific level is desirable for many types of samples such as clinical and environmental . To successfully use any method based on DNA or RNA detection, these assays must be coupled with large databases of nucleic acid sequence information for assay design to ensure that the desired information is provided and for the interpretation of raw data.",
        "Given that RNAseq functions by reading virtually all the RNAs present in the samples tested, we can also discern the magnitude of each RNA change and mark them as the canonical responses. In addition, as RNAseq is not constrained by probe usage as in microarrays, they are therefore more reliable in detecting novel interactions during influenza infections of hNECs. Hence, RNAseq analysis will further augment the transcriptomic data established previously by microarray analysis. The augmented baseline can then be applied to future clinical studies and practice"
