Let me look back at the provided context to find the relevant information.\n\nFirst, the passage mentions that more than 50% of patients with severe CHIKF (Chikungunya Fever) are over 65 years old, and a third of them die. But the question is about complications, not just demographics. \n\nLooking further, the passage lists several complications from most common to least common. The main ones are respiratory failure, cardiovascular decompensation, meningoencephalitis, severe acute hepatitis, severe cutaneous effects, other central nervous system problems, and kidney failure. \n\nAdditionally, there's a part about neonates. The text says that mothers can transmit CHIKV to their babies during the perinatal period, leading to high morbidity. By day 4 of life, all neonates were symptomatic, and six developed meningoencephalitis. So that's another complication related to transmission to newborns.\n\nI need to make sure I include all the complications listed. Let me check again. The main list includes respiratory failure, cardiovascular decompensation, meningoencephalitis, severe acute hepatitis, severe cutaneous effects, other CNS issues, and kidney failure.

The user might want them in order from most common to least. The passage says \"from most common to least common, include...\" so I should follow that order.

The clades are part of lineages like 1A, 1B, 1C, with subclades like 1A.1, 1B.1, etc. But the context doesn't mention a Clade A by itself. The answer might be that Clade A isn't discussed in the provided context, or perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the nomenclature.

The titles all mention \"The Battle Against Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): Emergency Management\" and the passages talk about noncontaminated CT disinfection procedures after suspected cases, fever-CT disinfection after examination, and preparing to disinfect imaging equipment immediately after the exam.\n\nThe key points here are that after examining a suspected COVID-19 case, the CT equipment needs to be disinfected. The passages mention \"immediately after the examination\" and \"sterilization procedures.\" The term \"noncontaminated CT disinfection procedures\" might be a bit confusing, but since they're talking about after the examination, it's likely referring to the steps taken right after the patient is done. \n\nThe answer should probably include that the equipment is disinfected immediately post-exam using specific sterilization procedures.

I need to base my answer on the provided context.\n\nFirst, I'll look through the context passages. The first passage mentions that RNA-Seq provides higher coverage, precision, and sensitivity. It allows mapping transcriptomic fragments to the reference genome, which helps in finding novel transcripts, SNPs, and other variants. So, RNA sequencing can monitor novel transcripts and genetic variations.\n\nAnother part of the context says RNAseq isn't constrained by probes like microarrays, making it better for detecting novel interactions during influenza infections. That suggests it can monitor interactions or changes in gene expression that aren't known beforehand.\n\nThe last passage talks about single-cell RNA analysis leading to sequencing and bioinformatic analysis. This implies RNAseq can monitor transcripts at the single-cell level, capturing different transcripts in individual cells.\n\nPutting it all together: RNA sequencing can monitor gene expression levels, novel transcripts, SNPs, other variants, interactions in diseases like influenza, and single-cell transcriptomic variations. The answer should list these points clearly based on the context provided.\n</think>\n\nRNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) can be used to monitor **gene expression levels, novel transcripts, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and other genetic variants**. It provides high-resolution data by capturing all RNA present in a sample, enabling the detection of previously unannotated transcripts and dynamic changes in gene expression. Additionally, RNA-Seq is effective for identifying interactions (e.g., during influenza infections) and analyzing transcriptomic variations at the single-cell level, offering advantages over microarrays and qRT-PCR in sensitivity, coverage, and the ability to discover new biological features.",

        "Title: Automated identification of multiple micro-organisms from resequencing DNA microarrays\nPassage: For both surveillance and diagnostic applications, fine-scale pathogen identification and near-neighbor discrimination is important; therefore, an assay that monitors at this very specific level is desirable for many types of samples such as clinical and environmental . To successfully use any method based on DNA or RNA detection, these assays must be coupled with large databases of nucleic acid sequence information for assay design to ensure that the desired information is provided and for the interpretation of raw data. Several well-established techniques use PCR to amplify individual target pieces of sequenced genomes to provide detection of organisms .",
        "Given that RNAseq functions by reading virtually all the RNAs present in the samples tested, we can also discern the magnitude of each RNA change and mark them as the canonical responses.
