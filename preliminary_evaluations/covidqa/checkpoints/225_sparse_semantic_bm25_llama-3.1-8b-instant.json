        "It is perhaps unsurprising that the mammalian host has evolved multiple antiviral mechanisms whose role is to inhibit viral replicative processes that are associated with entry and exit , necessitating either the evolution of directly encoded countermeasures by the virus, or other mechanisms of resistance or avoidance. Furthermore, these mechanisms are often regulated by type 1 interferons and pattern recognition responses, linking these factors to the wider antiviral immune response.",

These general mechanisms may account for the diversity of viruses inhibited, including nonenveloped viruses, such as reoviruses, that do not require fusion, but do need to disrupt the endosomal membrane to enter the cell ."
