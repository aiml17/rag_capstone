      "ground_truth_answer": "RNA sequencing can be used to monitor transcripts that may not be in the existing genomic annotation, allowing the search for novel transcripts, and even identification of SNPs and other variants, as well as for transcriptome profiling in cancers such as breast cancer, gastrointestinal tumors, and prostate cancer.",
      "generated_response": "RNA sequencing can be used to **monitor the entire transcriptome of a sample**, allowing researchers to:\n\n* Quantify the expression level of every RNA species (mRNA, lnc\u2011RNA, micro\u2011RNA, etc.) and track how those levels change over time or in response to a stimulus (e.g., influenza infection).  \n* Detect canonical and novel transcriptional responses, including previously unannotated transcripts, splice variants, and gene\u2011fusion events.  \n* Identify pathway activation and tissue\u2011injury signatures, such as innate\u2011immune and inflammatory pathways that are triggered during infection.  \n* Measure absolute RNA abundance when spike\u2011in controls are used, providing a quality\u2011control metric and enabling cross\u2011sample comparisons.  \n* Discover genetic variants (SNPs, indels) present in expressed transcripts.  \n\nIn short, RNA\u2011seq is a comprehensive tool for monitoring **gene\u2011expression dynamics, novel transcript discovery, pathway activation, and transcript\u2011level genetic variation** in any biological context.",

        "Given that RNAseq functions by reading virtually all the RNAs present in the samples tested, we can also discern the magnitude of each RNA change and mark them as the canonical responses. In addition, as RNAseq is not constrained by probe usage as in microarrays, they are therefore more reliable in detecting novel interactions during influenza infections of hNECs. Hence, RNAseq analysis will further augment the transcriptomic data established previously by microarray analysis.",
        "Title: Personal genomes, quantitative dynamic omics and personalized medicine\nPassage: The development of RNA sequencing brought higher coverage, better precision and quantitation, and higher resolution and sensitivity, bringing RNA-Seq technology and transcriptomics on par with genomic sequencing . RNA-Seq considers reads that correspond to millions of transcriptomic fragments that are mapped to the reference genome, to provide information on transcripts that may not be in the existing genomic annotation, allowing the search for novel transcripts, and even identification of SNPs and other variants, while showing remarkable reproducibility ."
