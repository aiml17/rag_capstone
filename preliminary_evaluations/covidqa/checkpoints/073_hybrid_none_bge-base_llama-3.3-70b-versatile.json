        "Title: Illuminating the Sites of Enterovirus Replication in Living Cells by Using a Split-GFP-Tagged Viral Protein\nPassage: transduction, the MLV particles were 5 to 10 times concentrated using a 100-kDa concentrator . For the generation of single-cell clones stably expressing GFP, BGM and HeLa cells were transduced and grown in the presence of puromycin to generate pools of GFP-expressing cells, which were subsequently used to prepare single-cell clones by limiting dilution. Expression of GFP was monitored during passaging by immunofluorescence microscopy using the GFP antibody.\n\nTitle: Accelerated viral dynamics in bat cell lines, with implications for zoonotic emergence\nPassage: After application of the overlay, plates were monitored periodically using an inverted fluorescence microscope until the first signs of GFP expression were witnessed . From that time forward, a square subset of the center of each well was imaged periodically, using a CellInsight CX5 High Content Screening Platform with a 4X air objective . Microscope settings were held standard across all trials, with exposure time fixed at 0.0006 s for each image. One color channel was imaged, such that images produced show GFP-expressing cells in white and non-GFP-expressing cells in black .\n\nTitle: Visualizing Viral Infection In Vivo by Multi-Photon Intravital Microscopy\nPassage: express cytoplasmic fluorescent proteins driven e.g., by the chicken \u03b2-actin promoter with cytomegalovirus enhancer or human ubiquitin C promoter . Many different mouse lines are available that contain reporter genes for cytoplasmic fluorescent proteins such as EGFP and mCherry . Due to strong and continuous expression rate of the fluorescent proteins long-term tracking of dividing cells without extensive bleaching is possible. In addition, with a superior signal-to-noise ratio visualization of small cellular structures with low cytoplasm content is feasible. Although the approach to adoptively transfer fluorescent cells of interest into donor mice for functional imaging studies is fast and flexible,\n\nTitle: Replication-Competent Influenza A Viruses Expressing Reporter Genes\nPassage: lungs. Not only was GFP observable in the lungs of infected mice ex vivo using IVIS for whole-organ imaging, but could also be observed using flow cytometry to analyze the infection progression in antigen presenting cells . Imaging of murine lungs showed that infection starts in the respiratory tract in areas close to large conducting airways and later spreads to deeper sections of the lungs . The authors found that using a 10 6 PFU intranasal inoculation, 10% of dendritic cells were observed to express GFP and 2%-3% of macrophages and neutrophils were also GFP+ at 48 h post-infection ."

        "Title: Personal genomes, quantitative dynamic omics and personalized medicine\nPassage: The development of RNA sequencing brought higher coverage, better precision and quantitation, and higher resolution and sensitivity, bringing RNA-Seq technology and transcriptomics on par with genomic sequencing . RNA-Seq considers reads that correspond to millions of transcriptomic fragments that are mapped to the reference genome, to provide information on transcripts that may not be in the existing genomic annotation, allowing the search for novel transcripts, and even identification of SNPs and other variants, while showing remarkable reproducibility . Transcriptome profiling has included looking at cancers , including breast cancer , gastrointestinal tumors and prostate cancer .\n\nTitle: Automated identification of multiple micro-organisms from resequencing DNA microarrays\nPassage: For both surveillance and diagnostic applications, fine-scale pathogen identification and near-neighbor discrimination is important; therefore, an assay that monitors at this very specific level is desirable for many types of samples such as clinical and environmental . To successfully use any method based on DNA or RNA detection, these assays must be coupled with large databases of nucleic acid sequence information for assay design to ensure that the desired information is provided and for the interpretation of raw data. Several well-established techniques use PCR to amplify individual target pieces of sequenced genomes to provide detection of organisms . These methods\n\nTitle: A Single Cell but Many Different Transcripts: A Journey into the World of Long Non-Coding RNAs\nPassage: Final steps of single-cell RNA analysis are the sequencing and bioinformatic analyses. Alternatives to RNA sequencing are qRT-PCR and microarrays. The former is laborious and has a limited number of targets, while microarrays demand previously established transcriptomic probes and might have some background noise interfering on low abundant transcripts . Thus, the available gold standard method is scRNA-seq. Once sequencing reads are obtained, low-quality bases, adaptors, and barcodes need to be trimmed before alignment. Spike-in controls can be used as quality control and also to estimate the absolute levels of RNA expression since in scRNA-seq the exact number of cells\n\nTitle: RNA Sequencing of H3N2 Influenza Virus-Infected Human Nasal Epithelial Cells from Multiple Subjects Reveals Molecular Pathways Associated with Tissue Injury and Complications\nPassage: changes to serve as potential reference markers of the innate responses of influenza infection. Given that RNAseq functions by reading virtually all the RNAs present in the samples tested, we can also discern the magnitude of each RNA change and mark them as the canonical responses. In addition, as RNAseq is not constrained by probe usage as in microarrays, they are therefore more reliable in detecting novel interactions during influenza infections of hNECs. Hence, RNAseq analysis will further augment the transcriptomic data established previously by microarray analysis. The augmented baseline can then be applied to future clinical studies and practice"
