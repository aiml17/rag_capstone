Hmm, maybe the context is from a research paper or report discussing lockdowns during a pandemic, perhaps related to the 2020 date mentioned.\n\nSince the context doesn't give a direct definition, I need to rely on general knowledge. A lockdown typically refers to strict restrictions on movement and activities to control the spread of a disease, like during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The mention of \"non-lockdown\" in the titles suggests comparing scenarios with and without lockdowns to assess their impact on infection rates. The user might be looking for a basic definition, so I should explain it as a public health measure enforced by authorities to limit social interactions and prevent disease transmission.

Viruses with identical or nearly identical genome sequences to those in the fall wave were circulating in early 1918 , at a time prior to the recognition of a new pandemic. It is perhaps not so great a leap to imagine that these viruses were related to\n\nTitle: The epidemiological and public health research response to 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1): experiences from Hong Kong\nPassage: of convalescent plasma to treat severe infections was shown to be feasible in a pandemic 57 and evidence of its effectiveness albeit from a small study should justify further studies. 56 While we focused on research into the epidemiology, impact, and control of pH1N1, much important research on pH1N1 has been carried out in other areas outside the scope of our review. To give two specific examples, local researchers confirmed the origins of the 2009 pandemic strain by comparison with a detailed local swine influenza surveillance program, 65 and performed important basic studies on pathogenesis. 66 Two sets of studies\n\nTitle: Economic analysis of pandemic influenza mitigation strategies for five pandemic severity categories\nPassage: Several related studies which also used individualbased simulation models of influenza spread coupled with costing models are those of those of Sander et al., Perlroth et al., Brown et al., and Andradottir et al. . The current study extends upon the scope of these studies in several ways: five gradations of pandemic severity are considered, more combinations of interventions are considered, social distancing interventions of varying durations are considered, and probabilities of severe health outcomes for each severity category are based on fatality, hospitalization and ICU usage data as observed from the 2009 pandemic. Also in contrast with those models,\n\nTitle: On Temporal Patterns and Circulation of Influenza Virus Strains in Taiwan, 2008-2014: Implications of 2009 pH1N1 Pandemic\nPassage: When there is more than one wave of infections, as in our current study, a variation of the Richards model can be utilized, which makes the distinction between two types of turning points ; one type which occurs at the peak incidence, and a second type which occurs in a multi-wave epidemic when the growth rate of the cumulative case number begins to increase again, indicating the beginning of the next wave."

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking \"How many reported viral pneumonia?\" based on the provided context. I need to look through the given passages to find any numbers related to viral pneumonia cases.\n\nFirst, looking at the first context about the 2019-nCoV. It mentions 2744 confirmed cases of pneumonia with 2019-nCoV infection as of January 26, 2020. That's a specific number related to viral pneumonia caused by that virus.\n\nThen there's a passage about primary influenza viral pneumonia. It talks about bacterial co-infections in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, with 29% of 77 fatal cases having bacterial pneumonia. But the question is about viral pneumonia, not bacterial. However, the title mentions \"primary influenza viral pneumonia,\" so maybe the 77 cases are viral? Wait, the passage says \"fatal cases of pandemic H1N1v 2009 infection,\" so those are viral pneumonia cases. The 77 cases would be viral, but the 29% refers to bacterial co-infection. The question is about the number of viral pneumonia cases, so maybe the 77 is relevant here. But the user is asking for how many were reported. The first context gives a specific number (2744) for 2019-nCoV, which is a viral pneumonia. The other contexts discuss influenza, but the numbers there are about attack rates or percentages, not exact counts. The third context mentions attack rates in different age groups, but no specific total numbers. The fourth context talks about patients with pneumonia more likely to receive antivirals, but again, no specific count.\n\nSo the only specific number given for reported viral pneumonia cases is the 2744 from the first passage. The other contexts discuss percentages or rates but not exact numbers. Therefore, the answer should be 2744.\n</think>\n\nThe context provides specific data on reported viral pneumonia cases related to the 2019-nCoV infection.

Earlier and subsequent versions of this chart are maintained on a personal blog length coverage in a single experiment with highly repetitious measurement of each nucleotide position . Despite assays having been published early on, subgenomic sequencing, once the mainstay of viral outbreak studies, has less often been published during MERS-CoV\n\nTitle: MERS coronavirus: diagnostics, epidemiology and transmission\nPassage: Analyses of MERS-CoV genomes have shown that most single nucleotide differences among variants were located in the last third of the genome , which encodes the spike protein and accessory proteins . At least nine MERS-CoV genomes contained amino acid substitutions in the receptor binding domain of the spike protein and codons 158 , 460 , 1020 , 1202 and 1208 bear investigation as markers of adaptive change . The spike protein had not changed in the recombinant MERS-CoV genome identified in China in 2015 but was reported to have varied at a higher rate than that for complete MERS-CoV\n\nTitle: MERS coronavirus: diagnostics, epidemiology and transmission\nPassage: Vigilance remains important for containment since MERS-CoV is a virus with a genetic makeup that has been observed for only three years and is not stable. Among all humans reported to be infected, nearly 40 % have died. Continued laboratory testing, sequencing, analysis, timely data sharing and clear communication are essential for such vigilance to be effective. Global alignment of case definitions would further aid accurate calculation of a case fatality ratio by including subclinical case numbers. Whole genome sequencing has been used extensively to study MERS-CoV travel and variation and although it remains a tool for experts, it appears\n\nTitle: MERS coronavirus: diagnostics, epidemiology and transmission\nPassage: Two studies during 2015, one looking at Jeddah-2014 MERS-CoV variants and another looking at a variant exported from South Korea to China, have now identified signs of genetic recombination among MERS-CoV variants. While human and camel whole genome sequences have retained >99 % identity with each other, members of genetically distinct lineages can and do swap genetic material when suitable conditions and coinfections co-occur .

But the question is about tracking the spread, so maybe this isn't the main one.\n\nSecond context: The bat cell lines study. They used an inverted fluorescence microscope to monitor plates until GFP expression was seen. Then they imaged a subset of each well periodically with a CellInsight CX5 platform. The settings were standardized, exposure time fixed. Images showed GFP cells in white. This seems like tracking over time in cell culture.\n\nThird context: Multi-photon intravital microscopy for in vivo visualization. They mention using cytoplasmic fluorescent proteins like EGFP and mCherry in mouse lines. The strong expression allows long-term tracking without bleaching and visualizing small structures. This is about in vivo tracking, so maybe relevant for in live animals.\n\nFourth context: Influenza viruses with reporter genes. They used IVIS for whole-organ imaging of lungs ex vivo and flow cytometry to analyze infection progression in antigen-presenting cells. They observed infection starting in airways and spreading deeper. Also, percentages of GFP+ cells at 48h.
