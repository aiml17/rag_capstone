Let me look through the provided context and passages to gather all the mentioned complications.\n\nFirst, in the context, it mentions that neonates transmitted the virus from their mothers during the perinatal period and developed meningoencephalitis. So that's one complication. Then, in the first passage, it lists several complications from most to least common: respiratory failure, cardiovascular decompensation, meningoencephalitis, severe acute hepatitis, severe cutaneous effects, other central nervous system problems, and kidney failure. Also, there's a mention of encephalitis due to vertical transmission in the second passage. \n\nAdditionally, the first passage notes that more than 50% of severe cases are in people over 65, with over 33% mortality, and many have underlying conditions. But the question is about complications, not demographics. So focusing on the complications: respiratory failure, cardiovascular decompensation, meningoencephalitis (which is the same as meningoencephalitis mentioned in the context), severe acute hepatitis, severe cutaneous effects, other CNS issues, kidney failure, and encephalitis specifically from vertical transmission. \n\nWait, the context says \"mengoencephalitis\"\u2014probably a typo for meningoencephalitis. Also, the second passage mentions encephalitis. So combining all these, the complications are respiratory failure, cardiovascular decompensation, meningoencephalitis, severe acute hepatitis, severe cutaneous effects, other central nervous system problems, kidney failure, and encephalitis from vertical transmission. \n\nI need to list them in order as per the passage. The passage lists them from most common to least: respiratory failure first, then cardiovascular, meningoencephalitis, etc. Also, the neonatal cases had encephalitis. So the answer should include all these complications, ordered as mentioned, and note the encephalitis from vertical transmission as an additional point.\n</think>\n\nThe complications associated with CHIKV (Chikungunya virus) include:  \n1. **Respiratory failure**  \n2. **Cardiovascular decompensation**  \n3. **Meningoencephalitis** (including encephalitis due to vertical transmission from infected mothers to neon",

Let me start by reading through the context carefully.\n\nFirst, the context mentions several clades like 1B.1, 1B.2, 1B.1.1, 1A.1, 1C.2, and others. The main discussion is about APD (probably Average Pairwise Distance) values between and within clades. The key points are that each clade generally has an APD greater than 7% from other clades and less than 7% within the clade, except for some exceptions. \n\nLooking at the titles and passages, the documents are about a nomenclature system for H1 hemagglutinin genes in swine influenza A viruses. The 1C lineage is mentioned with viruses from China and South Korea, and there's a mention of \"Other-Avian\" clades. The 1B human seasonal lineage is also discussed with APD tables.\n\nNow, the question is about \"Clade A.\" But in the context provided, I don't see any mention of a clade labeled \"A\" by itself. The clades discussed are 1A.1, 1B.1, 1B.2, 1C.2, etc. The first part of the context talks about exceptions in 1B.1 and 1B.2, and later mentions 1A.1 and 1A.1.1. The 1C lineage is covered in another section. \n\nWait, the user's answer example says \"Clade A\" but the context doesn't mention Clade A. Maybe there's a typo or misunderstanding. The clades are numbered with a number and a letter, like 1A.1. Perhaps the user meant Clade 1A.1? Or maybe there's a part of the context I missed. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the context again: The first passage mentions \"each clade had an APD...\" and exceptions like 1B.1, 1B.2, and 1A.1. The second passage talks about the 1C lineage. The title mentions \"Clade designations for 1C swine lineage.\" There's a mention of \"Other-Avian\"",

First, I need to recall what the context says about the S1 subunit.\n\nLooking back at the passage, the first sentence mentions that the spike glycoprotein is composed of S1 and S2 subunits. Then, the text discusses various structures like SL1, SL2, etc., which are similar among 2019-nCoV, human SARS-CoV, and bat SARS-related ZC45. The S5 part is mentioned in relation to orf1a/b, but that's part of the S2 subunit since the next sentence talks about the S2 subunit being highly conserved. \n\nThe key part here is that the passage doesn't directly mention the S1 subunit's comparison. It talks about the S2 subunit being 99% identical. The structures SL1 to SL5C are similar, but these might be part of the S1 since the S2 is discussed later. Also, there's a mention of deletions in the spike receptor binding domain in bat SARSr-CoVs compared to human SARS-CoV, but again, the receptor binding domain is typically part of the S1 subunit.

The S5 part is inside orf1a/b in 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV but not in ZC45. But the question is about S1. The passage doesn't directly compare the S1 subunit's sequence identity. It does mention that the S2 is 99% identical. For S1, maybe the structures are similar but the text doesn't give specific sequence percentages.

It is also a part of the normal intestinal microbiome and has been found in the healthy human gastrointestinal tract. Bacillus subtilis produces surfactins, fengycins, and iturins, which have antimicrobial and antiviral properties.",

Let me read through the context again to make sure I get all the details right.\n\nThe context mentions that recent studies show Bacillus subtilis is present in the GIT (gastrointestinal tract) in higher amounts than can be explained by food intake alone. So, that suggests it's a microorganism that's part of the gut microbiota. Then it says that B. subtilis produces surfactins, fengycins, and iturins in a specific ratio (6:37:57). These are probably types of compounds, maybe antibiotics or antimicrobial peptides. \n\nNext, the context states that B. subtilis helps retain gut barrier integrity, decreases endotoxin concentration, and reduces gut inflammation, citing a study from Bene et al., 2017. That's important because it shows the beneficial effects on the gut. Then it mentions that B. subtilis restores balance in gut microflora by increasing beneficial species like Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Butyricicoccus, while decreasing harmful ones like Acinetobacter, Ruminococcus, Clostridium, and Veillonella. \n\nPutting this all together, Bacillus subtilis seems to be a probiotic bacterium. The key points are its presence in the gut, production of specific compounds, and its role in maintaining gut health by modulating the microbiota. The answer should mention that it's a probiotic, part of the gut microbiota, produces certain substances, and has beneficial effects on gut barrier function and inflammation. Also, it helps increase good bacteria and reduce harmful ones. I need to make sure the answer is concise but covers all these aspects without getting too technical. Let me check if there's any other info I missed. The ratio of the compounds might not be necessary for the answer unless it's a key point, but the main thing is that it produces those substances.

I need to look through the provided context to find the answer.\n\nLooking at the first passage, the first sentence says, \"Most of the analysis of MERS-CoV genetics has been performed using high throughput or 'deep' sequencing methods for complete genome deduction.\" That seems like the direct answer. The passage also mentions that MERS-CoV was the first to have such widespread use of deep sequencing for studying an emerging viral outbreak globally.\n\nI should check the other passages to make sure there's no conflicting information. The other sections talk about genome analyses showing differences in specific regions, like the spike protein, and mention subgenomic sequencing being less published. But the main method for analysis is clearly stated as high throughput or deep sequencing in the first passage. The other parts don't contradict that; they just add more details about specific findings. So the answer should focus on the deep sequencing methods for complete genome deduction.\n</think>\n\nMost of the analysis of MERS-CoV genetics has been performed using **high throughput or \"deep\" sequencing methods for complete genome deduction**. This approach has been central to studying the virus's genetic variation and evolution, particularly during its emergence as a global health concern.",

The answer should include things like gene expression levels, novel transcripts, SNPs, variants, and maybe specific responses like innate immune responses mentioned in the first title.
