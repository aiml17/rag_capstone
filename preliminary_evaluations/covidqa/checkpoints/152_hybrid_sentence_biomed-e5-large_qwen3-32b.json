Wait, the titles and passages are a bit confusing. Let me look again.\n\nThe context has four entries. The first three are titled \"Estimating the number of infections and the impact of non-\" with the passage \"Lockdown\" each time. The fourth title is the same but the passage is \"banned Implemented with lockdown.57 24/3/2020\". Hmm, maybe there's a formatting issue here. It looks like the titles are cut off. The first part of the title is \"Estimating the number of infections and the impact of non-\" and then maybe the rest is missing. The passage for the first three is just \"Lockdown\", and the fourth passage says \"banned Implemented with lockdown.57 24/3/2020\". \n\nSo, putting this together, the context is probably discussing studies or reports on how non-lockdown measures affect infection numbers. The fourth entry mentions that lockdown was implemented on March 24, 2020, in some context, maybe a specific country or region. The user is asking for a definition of a lockdown. Since the context is about lockdowns in the context of estimating infections, the answer should define a lockdown as a public health measure to restrict movement and gatherings to control the spread of a disease, like during a pandemic. The context might be referring to how lockdowns are used compared to non-lockdown strategies, and the date given could be when a lockdown was enforced. The answer should be concise, explaining what a lockdown is, possibly mentioning restrictions on movement, closure of businesses, and social distancing measures. Since the user provided the context, I need to make sure the answer is based on that, but since the context is a bit fragmented, I'll rely on general knowledge but frame it within the context given. The key points from the context are the implementation date and the comparison with non-lockdown measures. So, the answer should mention that a lockdown is a strict measure to limit movement and gatherings, as opposed to non-lockdown strategies, and that it was implemented on March 24, 2020, in the example provided. However, the user's question is just asking for the definition, so the answer should be a standard definition but perhaps reference the",

First, I need to look through the provided context to find relevant information.\n\nLooking at the titles and passages, the first thing that stands out is the mention of the 2009 pH1N1 pandemic in Hong Kong's research. The passage says that local researchers confirmed the origins of the 2009 strain using a swine influenza surveillance program and did pathogenesis studies. But the question is about single-wave pandemics. Wait, the 2009 pandemic had multiple waves? Or was it a single wave? The context doesn't specify that. Hmm.\n\nThen there's the study titled \"On Temporal Patterns...\" which talks about multi-wave epidemics using a Richards model. The passage mentions that when there's more than one wave, they use a variation of the model. This implies that some pandemics have multiple waves, but the question is about single-wave ones. However, the study might have looked at single-wave scenarios as a comparison. But the passage doesn't explicitly mention research on single-wave pandemics; it's more about multi-wave.\n\nAnother title is \"The origins of the great pandemic,\" which discusses the 1889 pandemic with three major waves. The 1918 pandemic is also mentioned with herald waves stretching back to 1915. So those are multi-wave examples. The user is asking about severe, single-wave pandemics. The context doesn't directly mention any single-wave pandemics. The 2009 pH1N1 in Hong Kong's study is referenced, but the passage doesn't state whether it was a single wave. However, the Richards model study in Taiwan (2008-2014) mentions multi-wave epidemics, so maybe their research compared different wave patterns. But again, the focus is on multi-wave.\n\nThe economic analysis study mentions the 2009 pandemic's data on severity categories but doesn't specify wave patterns. The Hong Kong passage talks about convalescent plasma treatment and origins of the 2009 strain but not the number of waves. \n\nWait, the user's question is about severe, single-wave pandemics.

The answer should reflect that the recommended procedure is to disinfect the CT scanner right after the examination of a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patient. The terms \"noncontaminated\" might imply that the procedures are designed to prevent contamination, so following proper sterilization protocols is essential. Since the context doesn't list specific products or methods, the answer should focus on the timing and the action (immediate disinfection) rather than the specifics of the disinfectants used.\n</think>\n\nThe recommended procedure to disinfect a CT scanner after a COVID-19 exposure involves **immediately disinfecting the imaging equipment following the examination of a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 case**. The context emphasizes that sterilization or disinfection protocols should be performed promptly after the procedure to prevent contamination. Specific steps include preparing the equipment for disinfection and executing the process without delay, ensuring all surfaces and components of the CT scanner are properly sanitized. The repeated emphasis on \"immediately after the examination\" underscores the urgency of this protocol in emergency management settings.",
