Hmm, maybe the context is from a study or report discussing lockdowns during a pandemic, like COVID-19.\n\nFirst, I need to define a lockdown. A lockdown is a public health measure where authorities restrict movement and gatherings to control the spread of a disease. The context mentions \"non-lockdown\" and \"implemented with lockdown,\" which suggests comparing scenarios with and without lockdowns.

Since the context is about estimating infections, the answer should connect lockdowns to their purpose in reducing transmission. I should mention that lockdowns involve strict measures like stay-at-home orders, closing non-essential businesses, and limiting travel. Also, note that they aim to flatten the curve, prevent healthcare systems from being overwhelmed, and reduce the reproduction number of the virus. The context's focus on impact analysis implies that lockdowns are evaluated for their effectiveness in controlling infections, which is a key point to include.\n</think>\n\nA **lockdown** is a public health measure implemented by governments to restrict movement and gatherings of people in order to slow the spread of a contagious disease, such as during a pandemic.

Viruses with identical or nearly identical genome sequences to those in the fall wave were circulating in early 1918 , at a time prior to the recognition of a new pandemic. It is perhaps not so great a leap to imagine that these viruses were related to\n\nTitle: The epidemiological and public health research response to 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1): experiences from Hong Kong\nPassage: of convalescent plasma to treat severe infections was shown to be feasible in a pandemic 57 and evidence of its effectiveness albeit from a small study should justify further studies. 56 While we focused on research into the epidemiology, impact, and control of pH1N1, much important research on pH1N1 has been carried out in other areas outside the scope of our review. To give two specific examples, local researchers confirmed the origins of the 2009 pandemic strain by comparison with a detailed local swine influenza surveillance program, 65 and performed important basic studies on pathogenesis. 66 Two sets of studies\n\nTitle: Economic analysis of pandemic influenza mitigation strategies for five pandemic severity categories\nPassage: Several related studies which also used individualbased simulation models of influenza spread coupled with costing models are those of those of Sander et al., Perlroth et al., Brown et al., and Andradottir et al. . The current study extends upon the scope of these studies in several ways: five gradations of pandemic severity are considered, more combinations of interventions are considered, social distancing interventions of varying durations are considered, and probabilities of severe health outcomes for each severity category are based on fatality, hospitalization and ICU usage data as observed from the 2009 pandemic. Also in contrast with those models,\n\nTitle: On Temporal Patterns and Circulation of Influenza Virus Strains in Taiwan, 2008-2014: Implications of 2009 pH1N1 Pandemic\nPassage: When there is more than one wave of infections, as in our current study, a variation of the Richards model can be utilized, which makes the distinction between two types of turning points ; one type which occurs at the peak incidence, and a second type which occurs in a multi-wave epidemic when the growth rate of the cumulative case number begins to increase again, indicating the beginning of the next wave."

That's a specific number related to viral pneumonia caused by that virus.\n\nThe other contexts are about influenza.

The fourth passage talks about pneumonia in adults with seasonal influenza in the US from 2005-2008 but again doesn't give a total number of cases.\n\nSo the only context that provides a specific number is the first one regarding 2019-nCoV. The question is about \"reported viral pneumonia,\" and since 2019-nCoV is a virus, those 2744 cases would be viral pneumonia.

At least nine MERS-CoV genomes contained amino acid substitutions in the receptor binding domain of the spike protein and codons 158 , 460 , 1020 , 1202 and 1208 bear investigation as markers of adaptive change .

Continued laboratory testing, sequencing, analysis, timely data sharing and clear communication are essential for such vigilance to be effective.

While human and camel whole genome sequences have retained >99 % identity with each other, members of genetically distinct lineages can and do swap genetic material when suitable conditions and coinfections co-occur .

I need to look through the provided contexts to find the relevant information.\n\nFirst, looking at the first context about Enterovirus, they mention using split-GFP-tagged viral protein. They used immunofluorescence microscopy with a GFP antibody to monitor expression during passaging. But the question is about tracking spread, so maybe not the main answer here.\n\nNext, the second context on bat cell lines used an inverted fluorescence microscope to monitor plates until GFP expression was seen. Then they used a CellInsight CX5 platform with a 4X objective, taking images periodically. The settings were standardized, and images showed GFP cells in white. This seems like a method for tracking spread over time in cell cultures.\n\nThird context talks about in vivo imaging with multi-photon microscopy. They mention using reporter genes like EGFP and mCherry in mouse lines. The strong expression allows long-term tracking without bleaching, and they can visualize small structures. This is about in vivo tracking, so maybe relevant if the question includes animal models.\n\nFourth context about influenza viruses used IVIS for whole-organ imaging of lungs ex vivo and flow cytometry to analyze infection progression in antigen-presenting cells. They observed infection starting in airways and spreading deeper. This is tracking in mice, using both imaging and flow cytometry.\n\nThe question is about tracking spread. The answer likely combines methods from different contexts. The CellInsight platform in the second context is for high-content screening, taking periodic images. The IVIS in the fourth context is for whole-organ imaging. Also, flow cytometry was used to analyze specific cell types.
