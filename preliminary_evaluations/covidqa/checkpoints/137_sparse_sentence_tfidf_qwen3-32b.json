The context has four entries with the title \"Estimating the number of infections and the impact of non-\" and the passage \"Lockdown\" repeated multiple times. The last entry mentions \"banned Implemented with lockdown.57 24/3/2020\". \n\nHmm, the context seems a bit fragmented. The main keyword here is \"lockdown\". Since the passage just says \"Lockdown\" and the last part mentions it being implemented on 24/3/2020, maybe the answer is about the definition of a lockdown in the context of public health measures.\n\nA lockdown typically refers to strict restrictions on movement and activities to control the spread of a disease, like during a pandemic. Since the context is about estimating infections and the impact of non-lockdown measures, the answer should define a lockdown as a public health intervention. The date mentioned might be when a specific lockdown was implemented, but the question is general. So the answer should explain that a lockdown is a measure where people are required to stay home, non-essential businesses close, and movement is restricted to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. The context doesn't provide more details, so I need to rely on general knowledge but frame it based on the given context.\n</think>\n\nA **lockdown** is a public health measure implemented to restrict movement and gatherings of people in order to control the spread of infectious diseases, such as during a pandemic. It typically involves closing non-essential businesses, schools, and public spaces, and limiting travel to essential activities only. The context provided references a lockdown implemented on **24 March 2020**, likely in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as part of efforts to reduce infections and flatten the curve of transmission.",

The main ones mentioned are respiratory failure, cardiovascular decompensation, meningoencephalitis, severe acute hepatitis, severe cutaneous effects, other central nervous system problems, and kidney failure. That's a good list to start with.\n\nThen, there's another part about children being disproportionately affected. Also, the La Reunion Island outbreaks mention that neonates can get infected perinatally. The complications there include symptoms like CHIKF (Chikungunya fever) symptoms, and specifically, six neonates developed meningoencephalitis. Another study by Gerardin et al. mentions neonatal infections leading to encephalitis due to vertical transmission.\n\nAdditionally, the passage notes that over 50% of severe cases are in people over 65, and they have a high mortality rate (over 33% die). Underlying medical conditions in adults contribute to severe CHIKF. So maybe underlying conditions are a factor, but the question is about complications, not risk factors.\n\nI need to make sure I include all the complications mentioned.

The user is asking about \"Clade A,\" but looking through the passages, I notice mentions of lineages like 1A, 1B, 1C, etc. The question might be referring to Clade 1A, since there's a section about the 1A swine lineage. Let me check the passages again.\n\nIn the first passage, there's a mention of the 1C lineage with \"Other-Avian\" clades. Then another passage talks about the 1B human seasonal lineage. Then there's a passage specifically about the 1A swine lineage. The user's question says \"Clade A,\" but in the context, the lineages are labeled with numbers followed by letters, like 1A.1.1. So maybe \"Clade A\" is a typo or shorthand for 1A?\n\nLooking at the passage about the 1A lineage: \"The 1A lineage contained 1,889 viruses from 34 countries collected from 2010 to the present.\" It also mentions being divided into three second-order divisions. The answer should be based on this. The user's question is \"What does Clade A contain?\" but according to the context, the correct term is 1A lineage. Since there's no mention of a standalone \"Clade A,\" it's likely referring to 1A. Therefore, the answer would be that Clade 1A contains 1,889 viruses from 34 countries collected from 2010 to the present. However, the user wrote \"Clade A,\" so maybe they meant 1A. I need to confirm if there's any mention of Clade A specifically. Scanning through again, all the lineages are numbered with letters as subclades, like 1A.1.

I need to look through the provided passages to find relevant information.\n\nFirst, I remember that the S1 subunit is part of the spike glycoprotein. The first passage mentions that the S1 subunit has a signal peptide, N-terminal domain, and receptor-binding domain (RBD). Then, in the second passage, it says the S1 subunit of 2019-nCoV shares around 70% identity with the two bat SARS-like CoVs and human SARS-CoV. The core domain of the RBD is highly conserved, but most amino acid differences are in the external subdomain, which interacts with the host receptor. \n\nAnother part mentions that unlike 2019-nCoV and human SARS-CoV, most bat SARS-related CoVs have deletions in the RBD. Also, the external subdomain of the RBD in 2019-nCoV has only 40% identity with other SARS-related coronaviruses. \n\nPutting this together, the S1 subunit of 2019-nCoV has about 70% similarity to SARS-like CoVs and human SARS-CoV. The core RBD is conserved, but the external part varies more, which might affect receptor binding. The differences in the external subdomain could explain variations in host interaction and transmission. Also, the fact that bat CoVs have deletions in this region compared to human SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV suggests some evolutionary differences. \n\nI need to make sure I'm not mixing up S1 and S2. The question is specifically about S1. The S2 subunit is mentioned as being 99% identical, but the user is asking about S1. So the key points are the 70% identity, conserved core RBD, variable external subdomain, and the deletions in bat CoVs. Also, the 40% identity in the external subdomain compared to other SARS-related viruses. \n\nSo the answer should state that the S1 subunit of 2019-nCoV shares about 70% identity with SARS-like CoVs",

The passages mention that Bacillus species, including B. subtilis, are used in probiotics and traditional fermented foods. They talk about how B. subtilis helps in maintaining gut health by producing substances like surfactins, fengycins, and iturins. These compounds have antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties.

These lipopeptides have antimicrobial and antiviral actions. They protect against other microbes and reduce inflammation by affecting cytokines.
