      "ground_truth_answer": "RNA sequencing can be used to monitor transcripts that may not be in the existing genomic annotation, allowing the search for novel transcripts, and even identification of SNPs and other variants, as well as for transcriptome profiling in cancers such as breast cancer, gastrointestinal tumors, and prostate cancer.",
      "generated_response": "RNA sequencing can be used to monitor the full spectrum of RNA molecules present in a sample\u2014including the magnitude of expression changes for each transcript\u2014so that researchers can track canonical and novel transcriptional responses (such as innate\u2011immune pathways, tissue\u2011injury signatures, and other molecular pathways) that occur during influenza infection or other conditions.",

        "Thus, the available gold standard method is scRNA-seq.",
        "Given that RNAseq functions by reading virtually all the RNAs present in the samples tested, we can also discern the magnitude of each RNA change and mark them as the canonical responses. In addition, as RNAseq is not constrained by probe usage as in microarrays, they are therefore more reliable in detecting novel interactions during influenza infections of hNECs. Hence, RNAseq analysis will further augment the transcriptomic data established previously by microarray analysis.",
        "Alternatives to RNA sequencing are qRT-PCR and microarrays. The former is laborious and has a limited number of targets, while microarrays demand previously established transcriptomic probes and might have some background noise interfering on low abundant transcripts .",

To successfully use any method based on DNA or RNA detection, these assays must be coupled with large databases of nucleic acid sequence information for assay design to ensure that the desired information is provided and for the interpretation of raw data. Several well-established techniques use PCR to amplify individual target pieces of sequenced genomes to provide detection of organisms ."
