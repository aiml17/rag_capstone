      "ground_truth_answer": "RNA sequencing can be used to monitor transcripts that may not be in the existing genomic annotation, allowing the search for novel transcripts, and even identification of SNPs and other variants, as well as for transcriptome profiling in cancers such as breast cancer, gastrointestinal tumors, and prostate cancer.",
      "generated_response": "RNA sequencing can be used to monitor the entire transcriptome of a sample\u202f\u2014\u202fthe abundance and changes of all RNAs present.  It provides quantitative measurements of gene\u2011expression levels, detects novel transcripts and splice variants, identifies SNPs and other sequence variants, and can even reveal the presence of specific pathogens or infection\u2011related RNA signatures.",

        "Alternatives to RNA sequencing are qRT-PCR and microarrays. The former is laborious and has a limited number of targets, while microarrays demand previously established transcriptomic probes and might have some background noise interfering on low abundant transcripts .",
        "Title: Personal genomes, quantitative dynamic omics and personalized medicine\nPassage: The development of RNA sequencing brought higher coverage, better precision and quantitation, and higher resolution and sensitivity, bringing RNA-Seq technology and transcriptomics on par with genomic sequencing . RNA-Seq considers reads that correspond to millions of transcriptomic fragments that are mapped to the reference genome, to provide information on transcripts that may not be in the existing genomic annotation, allowing the search for novel transcripts, and even identification of SNPs and other variants, while showing remarkable reproducibility .",
        "Title: Automated identification of multiple micro-organisms from resequencing DNA microarrays\nPassage: For both surveillance and diagnostic applications, fine-scale pathogen identification and near-neighbor discrimination is important; therefore, an assay that monitors at this very specific level is desirable for many types of samples such as clinical and environmental . To successfully use any method based on DNA or RNA detection, these assays must be coupled with large databases of nucleic acid sequence information for assay design to ensure that the desired information is provided and for the interpretation of raw data. Several well-established techniques use PCR to amplify individual target pieces of sequenced genomes to provide detection of organisms .",
        "Given that RNAseq functions by reading virtually all the RNAs present in the samples tested, we can also discern the magnitude of each RNA change and mark them as the canonical responses. In addition, as RNAseq is not constrained by probe usage as in microarrays, they are therefore more reliable in detecting novel interactions during influenza infections of hNECs. Hence, RNAseq analysis will further augment the transcriptomic data established previously by microarray analysis.",
