The only other info is \"banned Implemented with lockdown.57 24/3/2020\" which might be a typo or a note.\n\nHmm, the user probably expects a definition of a lockdown. Since the context doesn't provide much, I need to rely on general knowledge. A lockdown is a public health measure where people are required to stay at home to prevent the spread of a disease, like during a pandemic. It restricts movement and gatherings. The context mentions non-lockdown impact, so maybe comparing scenarios with and without lockdowns. But the user just wants the definition. I should explain it clearly, mention the purpose, and maybe give an example from the context if possible. Wait, the date 24/3/2020 is when lockdowns started in some places, like the UK. Maybe that's relevant. But the answer should be concise. Let me put it all together.\n</think>\n\nA **lockdown** is a public health measure implemented to restrict movement and gatherings of people, typically during a pandemic or outbreak, to slow the spread of a contagious disease. It involves strict limitations on non-essential activities, closure of businesses, schools, and public spaces, and often mandates individuals to stay at home except for essential needs (e.g., healthcare, groceries). The goal is to reduce person-to-person transmission and prevent healthcare systems from being overwhelmed. \n\nIn the context provided, lockdowns are discussed as part of strategies to estimate their impact on reducing infections compared to scenarios without such restrictions. For example, the note \"banned Implemented with lockdown.57 24/3/2020\" may reference specific policies or data from March 24, 2020, a date when many countries began enforcing lockdowns during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

For example, 29% in adults over 15 and 61% in children under 15 in La Gloria. But again, these are attack rates, not total numbers. The third passage is about antiviral therapy in patients with pneumonia versus those without, but it doesn't give specific numbers.\n\nThe fourth passage is about 2019-nCoV (COVID-19) cases in China as of January 26, 2020. It states 2744 confirmed cases of pneumonia with 2019-nCoV infection. However, the user is asking about viral pneumonia in general. The question mentions Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan, but the passage here refers to 30 provinces in China. Wait, the user's initial context says \"Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan of China\" but the passage about 2019-nCoV is from 30 provinces. There's no mention of those three regions in the provided passages. \n\nSo, the only specific number given is the 2744 confirmed cases related to 2019-nCoV. However, the user's question is about \"reported viral pneumonia\" in general. The other passages don't provide specific numbers. The H1N1 passages mention percentages but not total cases. The antiviral therapy passage doesn't have numbers either. \n\nTherefore, the only concrete number is from the 2019-nCoV passage. But the user's question might be trying to trick me by mentioning Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan, but the passage doesn't specify those regions. The total is 2744 cases in 30 provinces.

Flow cytometry can measure the percentage of cells expressing GFP, like the 10% dendritic cells mentioned.\n\nAdditionally, the passage mentions imaging of murine lungs showing infection starting near large airways and spreading deeper. This could be part of the tracking. Also, immunofluorescence microscopy with a GFP antibody was used during passaging to monitor expression.

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking about the recommended procedure to disinfect a CT scanner after a COVID-19 exposure. The context provided has several passages with similar titles and mentions of CT disinfection procedures. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the context. The titles all mention \"The Battle Against Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): Emergency Management\" and the passages talk about noncontaminated CT disinfection procedures after suspected cases, fever-CT disinfection, and preparing to disinfect imaging equipment immediately after examination.\n\nThe key points here are that after examining a suspected COVID-19 case, the CT scanner needs to be disinfected. The passages mention \"immediately after the examination\" and \"sterilization procedures.\" The term \"noncontaminated CT disinfection procedures\" might be a bit confusing, but since it's after a suspected case, maybe they mean that even though the patient is suspected, the CT is being disinfected regardless. \n\nThe answer should probably include steps like immediate disinfection after the exam, using specific sterilization procedures. The context doesn't go into detailed steps, but it does emphasize that the equipment is prepared and disinfected right after. So the answer should state that the recommended procedure is to disinfect the CT scanner immediately after the examination using established sterilization protocols. I need to make sure not to add any extra steps not mentioned in the context. Also, the repetition in the titles might be a formatting error, but the content is consistent across the passages.
