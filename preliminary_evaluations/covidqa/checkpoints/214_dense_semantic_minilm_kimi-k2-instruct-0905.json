RNA-Seq considers reads that correspond to millions of transcriptomic fragments that are mapped to the reference genome, to provide information on transcripts that may not be in the existing genomic annotation, allowing the search for novel transcripts, and even identification of SNPs and other variants, while showing remarkable reproducibility .",
        "Title: Automated identification of multiple micro-organisms from resequencing DNA microarrays\nPassage: For both surveillance and diagnostic applications, fine-scale pathogen identification and near-neighbor discrimination is important; therefore, an assay that monitors at this very specific level is desirable for many types of samples such as clinical and environmental . To successfully use any method based on DNA or RNA detection, these assays must be coupled with large databases of nucleic acid sequence information for assay design to ensure that the desired information is provided and for the interpretation of raw data. Several well-established techniques use PCR to amplify individual target pieces of sequenced genomes to provide detection of organisms .",
        "Given that RNAseq functions by reading virtually all the RNAs present in the samples tested, we can also discern the magnitude of each RNA change and mark them as the canonical responses. In addition, as RNAseq is not constrained by probe usage as in microarrays, they are therefore more reliable in detecting novel interactions during influenza infections of hNECs. Hence, RNAseq analysis will further augment the transcriptomic data established previously by microarray analysis.",
