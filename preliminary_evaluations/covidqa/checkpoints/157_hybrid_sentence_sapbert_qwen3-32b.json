The titles seem incomplete, maybe they were cut off. The main keyword here is \"lockdown\". The passage mentions \"lockdown\" in the context of estimating infections and the impact of non-... something. The last entry mentions \"banned Implemented with lockdown.57 24/3/2020\" which might be a date or a reference number.\n\nSince the user is asking for a definition of a lockdown, I should base the answer on the context provided. The context seems to relate to public health measures, possibly during a pandemic. The mention of estimating infections suggests that lockdowns are used to control the spread of diseases. The word \"non-\" in the title might be part of \"non-pharmaceutical interventions\" which are common in public health strategies.\n\nPutting this together, a lockdown is likely a strict public health measure where people are required to stay at home, non-essential businesses are closed, and movement is restricted to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. The context also mentions it's implemented alongside other measures, as seen in the last entry. The date 24/3/2020 could refer to when a lockdown was implemented, perhaps in a specific country during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nI should make sure the answer is concise, uses the context provided, and explains the purpose and nature of a lockdown without adding external information. Since the user might be looking for a basic definition, I'll focus on the key points from the context: estimating infections, impact, and implementation as a public health measure.\n</think>\n\nA **lockdown** is a strict public health measure implemented to restrict movement and gatherings, typically during a pandemic or outbreak, to reduce the spread of infectious diseases. It involves closing non-essential businesses, limiting travel, and requiring individuals to stay at home except for essential activities.

That's a good list. Also, it mentions that children are disproportionately affected by severe CHIKV. \n\nThen, in another part, there's a study about mothers transmitting the virus to their babies during the perinatal period. The neonates developed symptoms by day 4, and some had meningoencephalitis. There were six neonates with confirmed CHIKV who developed meningoencephalitis. Also, another study by Gerardin et al. mentions neonatal infections leading to encephalitis due to vertical transmission. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the main complications are the ones listed in order, plus the neonatal issues like meningoencephalitis and encephalitis from mother to child transmission. I should make sure to include both the general complications and the specific ones related to neonates. Also, note that underlying conditions in adults and the age groups (elderly and children) are factors, but the question is specifically about complications. Let me check if there's anything else.

I need to look through the provided contexts to find relevant information.\n\nFirst, looking at the first context titled \"The origins of the great pandemic,\" it mentions the 1889 pandemic with three major waves, specifically noting the 1892 wave as the most intense. It also speculates about herald waves of the 1918 pandemic possibly starting as early as 1915. However, the 1918 pandemic is known for having multiple waves, so maybe this isn't directly about single-wave pandemics. But the mention of the 1889 pandemic having three waves might not fit the \"single-wave\" criteria. Still, the discussion about herald waves could be relevant if they're considering the initial wave as part of a larger pattern.\n\nNext, the second context about the 2009 pandemic in Hong Kong talks about research into the epidemiology and control of pH1N1. It mentions studies on convalescent plasma and the origins of the 2009 strain. However, the 2009 pandemic is typically described as having multiple waves in different regions, so maybe not a single wave. The focus here is more on the research methods and responses rather than the pandemic's wave structure.\n\nThe third context is an economic analysis considering five pandemic severity categories based on the 2009 pandemic. It discusses mitigation strategies and models, but again, the 2009 pandemic isn't a single-wave event. The study uses data from the 2009 pandemic to model different scenarios, but this doesn't directly address single-wave pandemics.\n\nThe fourth context from Taiwan discusses the 2009 pH1N1 pandemic and uses a Richards model variation to analyze multiple waves. The passage mentions distinguishing between two types of turning points in multi-wave epidemics. This seems to focus on multi-wave patterns rather than single-wave.\n\nPutting this together, none of the contexts explicitly mention research on severe, single-wave pandemics. The 1889 pandemic had three waves, the 1918 had multiple, 2009 also multiple. The research mentioned in the contexts is more about multi-wave pandemics or models considering varying severity and interventions.
