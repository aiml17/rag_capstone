Hmm, maybe the context is from a research paper or report discussing lockdowns during a pandemic, perhaps related to the 2020 date mentioned.\n\nSince the context is limited, I need to rely on general knowledge. A lockdown typically refers to a government-imposed restriction on movement and activities to control the spread of a contagious disease. It involves closing non-essential businesses, schools, and public spaces, and limiting people's movement to prevent large gatherings. The goal is to reduce person-to-person transmission, especially during a pandemic like COVID-19. The context mentions estimating infections, so the study might be analyzing how lockdowns affect infection rates compared to not having them. The user might be looking for a concise definition, possibly in the context of the study provided. Since the context is minimal, I should define lockdown in general terms but also note that the provided context relates to its impact on infections.\n</think>\n\nA **lockdown** is a government-imposed restriction on movement and activities, typically implemented during a public health crisis (e.g., a pandemic) to limit the spread of infectious diseases. It involves measures such as closing non-essential businesses, schools, and public spaces, restricting travel, and enforcing social distancing. The goal is to reduce person-to-person transmission by minimizing contact between individuals. \n\nIn the context provided, the study likely examines how lockdowns impact the number of infections compared to scenarios without such restrictions, as indicated by the focus on \"estimating the number of infections and the impact of non-lockdown.\"",

Still, the context talks about viruses circulating before the recognized pandemic, which might relate to understanding pandemic origins but not single-wave specifically.\n\nNext, the second context about the 2009 pandemic in Hong Kong discusses research on pH1N1, including convalescent plasma treatment and studies on origins and pathogenesis. The 2009 pandemic had multiple waves too, but the research here might not focus on single-wave scenarios. However, the mention of local surveillance programs and origins could be part of broader pandemic research.\n\nThe third context is about economic analysis of mitigation strategies across five severity categories. It references studies using simulation models for influenza spread. The 2009 pandemic data is used for health outcome probabilities. While this is about mitigation strategies rather than the pandemic's wave structure, it's part of pandemic research but not directly about single-wave events.\n\nThe fourth context from Taiwan discusses the 2009 pH1N1 pandemic and uses a Richards model variation for multi-wave epidemics. They mention distinguishing between turning points in multi-wave scenarios. This directly addresses multi-wave patterns, which contrasts with the user's query on single-wave.

Viruses with identical or nearly identical genome sequences to those in the fall wave were circulating in early 1918 , at a time prior to the recognition of a new pandemic. It is perhaps not so great a leap to imagine that these viruses were related to\n\nTitle: The epidemiological and public health research response to 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1): experiences from Hong Kong\nPassage: of convalescent plasma to treat severe infections was shown to be feasible in a pandemic 57 and evidence of its effectiveness albeit from a small study should justify further studies. 56 While we focused on research into the epidemiology, impact, and control of pH1N1, much important research on pH1N1 has been carried out in other areas outside the scope of our review. To give two specific examples, local researchers confirmed the origins of the 2009 pandemic strain by comparison with a detailed local swine influenza surveillance program, 65 and performed important basic studies on pathogenesis. 66 Two sets of studies\n\nTitle: Economic analysis of pandemic influenza mitigation strategies for five pandemic severity categories\nPassage: Several related studies which also used individualbased simulation models of influenza spread coupled with costing models are those of those of Sander et al., Perlroth et al., Brown et al., and Andradottir et al. . The current study extends upon the scope of these studies in several ways: five gradations of pandemic severity are considered, more combinations of interventions are considered, social distancing interventions of varying durations are considered, and probabilities of severe health outcomes for each severity category are based on fatality, hospitalization and ICU usage data as observed from the 2009 pandemic. Also in contrast with those models,\n\nTitle: On Temporal Patterns and Circulation of Influenza Virus Strains in Taiwan, 2008-2014: Implications of 2009 pH1N1 Pandemic\nPassage: When there is more than one wave of infections, as in our current study, a variation of the Richards model can be utilized, which makes the distinction between two types of turning points ; one type which occurs at the peak incidence, and a second type which occurs in a multi-wave epidemic when the growth rate of the cumulative case number begins to increase again, indicating the beginning of the next wave."

At least nine MERS-CoV genomes contained amino acid substitutions in the receptor binding domain of the spike protein and codons 158 , 460 , 1020 , 1202 and 1208 bear investigation as markers of adaptive change .

Among all humans reported to be infected, nearly 40 % have died. Continued laboratory testing, sequencing, analysis, timely data sharing and clear communication are essential for such vigilance to be effective.

While human and camel whole genome sequences have retained >99 % identity with each other, members of genetically distinct lineages can and do swap genetic material when suitable conditions and coinfections co-occur .
