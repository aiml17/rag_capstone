Instead, the headlights will be deactivated when the headlight switch is placed in the parking lights position. However, the DRLs will still be activated along with the front and rear marker lights in this scenario.\n\nThe context also mentions that the DRLs may be deactivated when the parking brake is engaged, and that for vehicles sold in Canada, the DRLs will automatically deactivate when the front fog lights are turned on.\n\nAdditionally, the context states that on some vehicles, the Daytime Running Lights may deactivate or reduce intensity on one side of the vehicle when a turn signal is activated on that side, or on both sides of the vehicle when the hazard warning lights are activated.\n\nHowever, the context does not explicitly state that the DRLs can be manually deactivated by the driver. The information provided suggests that the ability to deactivate the DRLs may be limited or controlled by the vehicle's design and features, rather than being a user-configurable option.\n\nTherefore, based on the given context, it is not clear if the DRLs can be deactivated by the driver.

      "ground_truth_answer": "To make your steering wheel heated, you need to locate the heated steering wheel button on the center of the instrument panel below the radio screen, or within the Climate or Controls screen of the touchscreen. Press the heated steering wheel button once to turn the heating element on. Press the button again to turn the heating element off. Remember, the engine must be running for the heated steering wheel to operate. Additionally, be cautious as the heating element can cause burns, especially if used for long periods, so individuals with certain physical conditions should be extra careful when using it. Do not place anything on the steering wheel that insulates against heat to avoid overheating.",
      "generated_response": "To activate the heated\u2011steering\u2011wheel function, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Locate the control**  \n   - **Physical button:** It is mounted on the centre of the instrument panel, directly below the radio screen.  \n   - **Touch\u2011screen option:** Open the **Climate** or **Controls** screen on the U\u2011Connect touchscreen; the heated\u2011steering\u2011wheel button will be shown there.\n\n2. **Turn the heater on**  \n   - Press the button **once**. The heating element inside the wheel will engage and begin warming the wheel.\n\n3. **Turn the heater off**  \n   - Press the same button **again** when you no longer need heat. The system stays on until you manually switch it off.\n\n4. **Things to keep in mind**  \n   - The wheel has **only one temperature setting**; you cannot adjust the heat level.  \n   - If the wheel is already warm (e.g., after a short drive), the heater may not activate until it cools down.  \n   - **Do not place blankets, covers, or any insulating material** on the wheel, as this can cause the heater to overheat.  \n   - People with reduced skin sensation (elderly, diabetics, etc.) should use the heater with caution to avoid burns.  \n   - Voice commands cannot control the heated steering wheel; you must use the button or touchscreen.\n\n5. **Optional automatic activation**  \n   - If you prefer the wheel (and possibly the driver\u2019s seat) to turn on automatically, you can set it in the **Comfort menu** under **U\u2011Connect Settings**.
