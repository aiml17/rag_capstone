      "question": "When will the Automatic SOS be triggered?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "The Automatic SOS will be triggered in the event that your vehicle's airbags deploy.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking when the Automatic SOS will be triggered. I need to look through the provided context to find the answer.\n\nFirst, the context mentions \"Automatic SOS \u2014 If Equipped\" as a hands-free safety service that connects you with help if the vehicle's airbags deploy. So, the main trigger here is the airbags deploying. That's probably the primary condition for the Automatic SOS to activate automatically without any user input.\n\nThen there's also the SOS Call button on the overhead console. If someone manually presses that button, it initiates an SOS call. But there's a note about an accidental press: a 10-second delay before the call goes through, and you can cancel it by pressing the button again or using the cancellation button on the device screen. So pressing the SOS Call button manually is another way to trigger it, but it's a user-initiated action, not automatic.\n\nThe question specifically asks about \"Automatic SOS,\" which the context says is triggered when airbags deploy. The manual SOS call via the button is a separate feature, even though it's part of the same system. The answer should focus on the automatic trigger, which is airbag deployment. The other details about the button are for the manual SOS call, not the automatic one.\n\nI need to make sure I don't confuse the two. The answer should state that Automatic SOS is triggered when the airbags deploy. The context clearly says that in the first sentence. The rest of the details about the SOS button are for the manual activation, which isn't part of the \"Automatic\" feature. So the answer is when the airbags deploy.\n</think>\n\nThe Automatic SOS will be triggered when the vehicle\u2019s airbags deploy. This hands-free safety service automatically connects the vehicle to an SOS operator in such an event. Additionally, the SOS Call button on the overhead console can manually initiate an SOS call, but this is a separate action from the automatic trigger. The automatic feature is specifically activated by airbag deployment. \n\n**Answer:** The Automatic SOS is triggered when the vehicle\u2019s airbags deploy.",

The information provided suggests that the ability to deactivate the DRLs may be limited or controlled by the vehicle's design and features, rather than being a user-configurable option.\n\nTherefore, based on the given context, it is not clear if the DRLs can be deactivated by the driver. The ability to deactivate them may depend on the specific vehicle model and market regulations.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they can deactivate the DRLs. I need to check the context provided to find the answer.\n\nLooking through the context, there's a mention that DRLs may deactivate under certain conditions. For example, when the parking brake is engaged, or when front fog lights are on in Canada. Also, when turn signals or hazard lights are activated, the DRLs might deactivate or reduce intensity. But the user is asking about deactivating them manually.\n\nWait, there's a part about BeltAlert being activatable or deactivatable by an authorized dealer, but that's a different system. The context doesn't mention anything about the user being able to deactivate DRLs themselves. It says DRLs are in a dedicated position and their activation depends on transmission settings or vehicle movement. Also, in Canada, the headlight switch doesn't have an OFF detent, but that's about the switch positions.\n\nSo, based on the info given, there's no mention of a user switch or button to turn off DRLs. The deactivation happens automatically under specific conditions. The answer should probably be that you can't deactivate them manually, only under those automatic conditions.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: The Daytime Running Lights (DRLs) cannot be manually deactivated by the driver under normal conditions. They automatically deactivate or reduce intensity in specific scenarios, such as when the parking brake is engaged, front fog lights are turned on (in Canada), or when turn signals/hazard lights are activated. There is no mention of a manual override or user-controlled switch to disable DRLs beyond these automatic conditions.",

But the question is about changing the speed after it's already set.

The context mentions that pushing SET (+) or (-) sets the current speed, but if the system is set when above 20mph, it takes the current speed. So if you're already cruising and press SET again, it would lock in the new speed. But how do you change it incrementally?\n\nWait, maybe the SET (+) increases the speed and SET (-) decreases it. The initial instruction says \"push the SET (+) or SET (-) button\" when reaching the desired speed. But if you want to change it after, perhaps using those buttons again would adjust it.

Also, the process of pressing SET after reaching the desired speed implies that you can set it again if you adjust the speed manually.

I need to go through the context and pick out the key features.\n\nFirst, the context mentions that power windows allow movement with a button push. The switches are on the instrument panel below climate controls. Then there's the Auto-Down feature for driver and front passenger doors. Pushing the switch down past a detent makes the window go down automatically. Also, there's a warning about not leaving kids unattended because they might get trapped. The switches stay active for 10 minutes after turning off the ignition, and opening a front door cancels that. Rear windows have switches on the center console. Also, to stop Auto-Down, you pull up briefly. No anti-pinch when almost closed. Power door locks are mentioned too, but the question is about power windows.\n\nSo the special features here are the Auto-Down function, the location of the switches, the 10-minute active period after ignition off, and the safety warnings about children. The main unique thing seems to be the Auto-Down feature. The answer should highlight that. Also, the ability to stop the window during Auto-Down by pulling up. But the question is asking what's special, so the primary special feature is the Auto-Down. Also, the switches remaining active for 10 minutes. But maybe the main point is the Auto-Down. Let me check the context again. The Auto-Down is mentioned multiple times. The answer should include that. Also, the warning about children is important but maybe not part of the \"special\" feature. The question is about what's special, so the features like Auto-Down and the 10-minute active period. But the answer should be concise. The user probably wants the key special feature. The Auto-Down is highlighted as a special feature. So the answer would be that the power windows have an Auto-Down feature allowing automatic window lowering when the switch is pushed down past the detent. Also, maybe mention the 10-minute active period. But maybe the main point is the Auto-Down. Let me check the example answer structure. The user's example answer is in the format \"Answer: ...\". So the answer should be a sentence or two. The main special thing is the Auto-Down feature. So the answer is that they have an Auto-Down feature where pushing the switch",
