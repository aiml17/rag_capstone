To cancel the SOS Call connection, push the SOS call button on the overhead console or press the cancellation button on the Device Screen.  Termination of the SOS Call will turn off the green LED light on the overhead console.  The LED light located within the ASSIST and SOS buttons on the overhead console will turn green once a connection to an SOS operator has been made.  Once a connection between the vehicle and an sos operator is made, the sos call system may transmit the following important vehicle information to an sos operator: indication that the occupant placed an sos call.  The vehicle brand.  The last known GPS coordinates of the vehicle.  You should be able to speak with the SOS operator through the vehicle audio system to determine if additional help is needed.  Warning: always obey traffic laws and pay attention to the road.  ALWAYS drive safely with your hands on the steering wheel.  You have full responsibility and assume all risks related to the use of the features and applications in this vehicle.  Only use the features and applications when it is safe to do so.  Failure to do so may result in an accident involving serious injury or death.  Note: your vehicle may be transmitting data as authorized by the subscriber.  Once a connection is made between the vehicle\u2019s SOS Call system and the SOS operator, the SOS operator may be able to open a voice connection with the vehicle to determine if additional help is needed.  Once the SOS operator opens a voice connection with the vehicle\u2019s SOS Call system, the operator should be able to speak with the vehicle occupants, and hear sounds occurring in the vehicle.  The vehicle\u2019s SOS Call system will attempt to remain connected with the SOS operator until the SOS operator terminates the connection.  The SOS operator may attempt to contact appropriate emergency responders and provide them with important vehicle information and GPS coordinates.  WARNING: If anyone in the vehicle could be in danger (e.g., fire or smoke is visible, dangerous road conditions or location), do not wait for voice contact from an Emergency Services Agent.  All occupants should exit the vehicle immediately and move to a safe location.  Never place anything on or near the vehicle\u2019s operable network and GPS antennas.  You could prevent operable network and GPS signal reception, which can prevent your vehicle from placing an emergency call.  An operable network and GPS signal reception is required for the SOS Call system to function properly.  The SOS Call system is embedded into the vehicle\u2019s electrical system.  Do not add aftermarket electrical equipment to the vehicle\u2019s electrical system.  This may prevent your vehicle from sending a signal to initiate an emergency call.  To avoid interference that can cause the SOS Call system to fail, never add aftermarket equipment (e.g., two-way mobile radio, CB radio, data recorder, etc.)  to your vehicle\u2019s electrical system or modify the antennas on your vehicle.  IF YOUR VEHICLE LOSES BATTERY POWER FOR ANY REASON (INCLUDING DURING OR AFTER AN ACCIDENT), THE UCONNECT FEATURES, APPS AND SERVICES, AMONG OTHERS, WILL NOT OPERATE.  Modifications to any part of the SOS Call system could cause the air bag system to fail when you need it.  You could be injured if the air bag system is not there to help protect you.\n\n Connected Services SOS FAQs \u2014 If Equipped What happens if I accidentally push the SOS Call button on the mirror or overhead console?

      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the provided context, here are the key things to pay attention to regarding the clutch pedal:\n\n1. Fully press the clutch pedal before shifting gears. Pressing the clutch pedal all the way down is necessary when changing gears to prevent damage to the transmission.\n\n2. As you release the clutch pedal, lightly press the accelerator pedal. This coordination of the clutch and accelerator is important for smooth gear shifts.\n\n3. Certain noise from the transmission may be noticeable when the clutch is engaged (pedal released). This noise is normal and not an indication of a problem with the clutch or transmission.\n\n4. Ensure the carpet is securely attached and does not interfere with the operation of the clutch pedal. Unattached or improperly placed carpet could get stuck under the clutch pedal and cause a loss of vehicle control.\n\nIn summary, focus on fully pressing and properly releasing the clutch pedal during gear shifts, be aware of normal transmission noises, and ensure the floor carpet does not impact clutch pedal operation.",
      "generated_response": "According to the context, you should fully press the clutch pedal before shifting gears, and also check for any interference with the clutch pedal when the carpet is installed, by fully depressing the clutch pedal.

        " Shifting Fully press the clutch pedal before shifting gears.  As you release the clutch pedal, lightly press the accelerator pedal.  You should always use FIRST gear when starting from a standing position.  Note: A certain amount of noise from the transmission is normal.  This noise can be most noticeable when the vehicle is idling in NEUTRAL with the clutch engaged (clutch pedal released), but it may also be heard when driving.  The noise may also be more noticeable when the transmission is warm.  This noise is normal and is not an indication of a problem with your clutch or transmission.\n\n Before Climbing A Steep Hill As you approach a hill, consider its grade or steepness.  Determine if it is too steep.  Look to see what the traction is on the hill side trail.  Is the trail straight up and down?  What is on top and the other side?  Are there ruts, rocks, branches or other obstacles on the path?  Can you safely recover the vehicle if something goes wrong?  If everything looks good and you feel confident, shift the transmission into a lower gear with 4L engaged, and proceed with caution, maintaining your momentum as you climb the hill.\n\n Carpet Safety Information Always use carpet designed to fit your vehicle.  Only use carpet that does not interfere with the operation of the pedal assemblies.  Only operate the vehicle when the carpet is securely attached by the grommets so it cannot slip out of position and interfere with the pedal assemblies or impair safe operation of your vehicle in other ways.  WARNING: If operating the vehicle without carpet in place the floor may become hot, and there is a risk of burns.  An improperly attached, damaged, folded, or damaged grommets may cause your carpet to interfere with the accelerator, brake, or clutch pedals and cause a loss of vehicle control.  To prevent SERIOUS INJURY or DEATH: ALWAYS securely attach your carpet using the grommets.  ALWAYS make sure objects cannot fall or slide into the driver\u2019s side floor area when the vehicle is moving.  Objects can become trapped under accelerator, brake, or clutch pedals and could cause a loss of vehicle control.  NEVER place any objects under the carpet (e.g., towels, keys, etc.).  These objects could change the position of the carpet and may cause interference with the accelerator, brake, or clutch pedals.  ONLY install carpet designed to fit your vehicle.  NEVER install carpet that cannot be properly attached and secured to your vehicle.  If the carpet needs to be replaced, only use manufacturer approved carpet for the specific make, model, and year of your vehicle.  If the vehicle carpet has been removed and re-installed, always properly attach carpet to the floor and check that the floor mat fasteners are secure to the vehicle carpet.  Fully depress each pedal to check for interference with the accelerator, brake, or clutch pedals then re-install the floor mats."

If this occurs, the message \u201cDRIVER OVERRIDE\u201d will display in the instrument cluster display.  If you continue to accelerate beyond the set speed while ACC is enabled, the system will not be controlling the distance between your vehicle and the vehicle ahead.  The vehicle speed will only be determined by the position of the accelerator pedal.  Cruise Control SET Indicator Light \u2014 If Equipped With A Premium Instrument Cluster This indicator light will illuminate when the cruise control is set to the desired speed\n\n To set a desired speed when the vehicle reaches the speed desired, push the set (+) button or the set (-) button and release.  The instrument cluster display will show the set speed.  If acc is set when the vehicle speed is below 20 mph (32 km/h), the set speed will default to 20 mph (32 km/h).  If either system is set when the vehicle speed is above 20 mph (32 km/h), the set speed shall be the current speed of the vehicle.  Note: Fixed Speed Cruise Control can be used without ACC enabled.  To change between the different modes, push the ACC on/off button which turns the ACC and the Fixed Speed Cruise Control off.  Pushing the Fixed Speed Cruise Control on/off button will result in turning on (changing to) Fixed Speed Cruise Control mode.  WARNING: In Fixed Speed Cruise Control mode (ACC not enabled), the system will not react to vehicles ahead.  In addition, the proximity warning does not activate and no alarm will sound even if you are too close to the vehicle ahead since neither the presence of the vehicle ahead nor the vehicle-to-vehicle distance is detected.  Be sure to maintain a safe distance between your vehicle and the vehicle ahead.  Always be aware which mode is selected.  Note: Fixed Speed Cruise Control cannot be set below 20 mph (32 km/h).  Note: Keeping your foot on the accelerator pedal can cause the vehicle to continue to accelerate beyond the set speed.  If this occurs, the message \u201cDRIVER OVERRIDE\u201d will display in the instrument cluster display.  If you continue to accelerate beyond the set speed while ACC is enabled, the system will not be controlling the distance between your vehicle and the vehicle ahead.  The vehicle speed will only be determined by the position of the accelerator pedal."

      "question": "What is special about power windows?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Power windows have an Auto-Down feature where the window will go down automatically if the window switch is pushed down past the detent and released.",
      "generated_response": "The power windows have an Auto-Down feature on the driver and front passenger door switches, which allows the windows to go down automatically when the switch is pushed down past the detent and released.

        " The power windows feature allows for movement of the windows with the push of a button.  The power window switches are located on the instrument panel below the climate controls.  Push the switch downward to open the window and pull upward to close the window.  The driver door power window switch and the front passenger door power window switch have an Auto-Down feature.  Push the window switch down, past the detent, and release and the window will go down automatically.  Power Window Switches Never leave children unattended in a vehicle, and do not let children play with power windows.  Do not leave the key fob in or near the vehicle, or in a location accessible to children.  Occupants, particularly unattended children, can become entrapped by the windows while operating the power window switches.  Such entrapment may result in serious injury or death.  The power window switches will remain active for up to 10 minutes after the ignition is placed in the OFF position.  Opening either front door will cancel this feature.  There are window switches located on the rear of the center console for the rear passenger windows.\n\n Auto-Down Feature The driver door power window switch and the front passenger door power window switch have an Auto-Down feature.  Push the window switch down, past the detent, and release and the window will go down automatically.  To open the window part way, push the window switch down briefly, without going past the detent, and release it when you want the window to stop.  To stop the window from going all the way down during the Auto-Down operation, pull up on the switch briefly.  WARNING: There is no anti-pinch protection when the window is almost closed.  Be sure to clear all objects from the window before closing.\n\n Power Door Locks \u2014 If Equipped The power door lock switch is located on each front door panel.  Push the switch forward to unlock the doors, and rearward to lock the doors.  WARNING: For personal security reasons and safety in a collision, lock the vehicle doors when you drive, as well as when you park and exit the vehicle.  When exiting the vehicle, always place the ignition in the OFF position and remove the key from the vehicle.  Unsupervised use of vehicle equipment may cause severe personal injuries and death.  Never leave children alone in a vehicle, or with access to an unlocked vehicle.  Allowing children to be in a vehicle unattended is dangerous for a number of reasons.  A child or others could be seriously or fatally injured.  Children should be warned not to touch the parking brake, brake pedal or the gear selector.  Do not leave the key fob in or near the vehicle or in a location accessible to children.  A child could operate power windows, other controls, or move the vehicle."
