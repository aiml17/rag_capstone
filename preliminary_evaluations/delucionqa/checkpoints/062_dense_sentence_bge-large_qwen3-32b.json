      "question": "When will the Automatic SOS be triggered?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "The Automatic SOS will be triggered in the event that your vehicle's airbags deploy.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking when the Automatic SOS will be triggered. I need to look through the provided context to find the answer.\n\nFirst, the context mentions \"Automatic SOS \u2014 If Equipped\" and describes it as a hands-free safety service that connects you with help if the vehicle's airbags deploy. So, the key trigger here is the airbags deploying. That's one scenario.\n\nThen there's the SOS Call button on the overhead console. If someone pushes that button, it initiates a call. But there's a 10-second delay to prevent accidental activation. Also, pushing it by mistake can be canceled within those 10 seconds. So, manually pressing the SOS button is another trigger.\n\nThe context also notes that if the vehicle loses battery power, the UConnect features, including SOS, won't work. But that's more about when it doesn't work rather than when it's triggered.\n\nAnother part says that when the SOS operator connects, they can get vehicle info and GPS location. But that's after the SOS is triggered, not the trigger itself.\n\nSo putting it all together, the Automatic SOS is triggered either automatically when airbags deploy or manually by pressing the SOS Call button. The answer should mention both scenarios. The user might be looking for both triggers. Let me check again to make sure I didn't miss any other conditions. The context doesn't mention other triggers like crashes without airbag deployment or other sensors. It specifically says airbag deployment and pressing the SOS button. So the answer should include both.\n</think>\n\nThe Automatic SOS will be triggered in two scenarios:  \n1. **Automatically** when the vehicle\u2019s airbags deploy, initiating a hands-free connection to an SOS operator.  \n2. **Manually** by pressing the SOS Call button on the overhead console or mirror. In this case, there is a 10-second delay before the call connects, allowing the user to cancel it by pressing the SOS button again or using the cancellation button on the device screen.  \n\nIf triggered manually by accident, the system provides a 10-second window to cancel the call.",

This coordination of the clutch and accelerator is important for smooth gear shifts.\n\n3. Certain noise from the transmission may be noticeable when the clutch is engaged (pedal released).

Then, when releasing the clutch, you should lightly press the accelerator. Also, when starting from a standing position, use first gear. \n\nThere's a note about transmission noise being normal, especially when idling in neutral with the clutch engaged (clutch pedal released).

Instead, the headlights will be deactivated when the headlight switch is placed in the parking lights position. However, the DRLs will still be activated along with the front and rear marker lights in this scenario.\n\nThe context also mentions that the DRLs may be deactivated when the parking brake is engaged, and that for vehicles sold in Canada, the DRLs will automatically deactivate when the front fog lights are turned on.\n\nAdditionally, the context states that on some vehicles, the Daytime Running Lights may deactivate or reduce intensity on one side of the vehicle when a turn signal is activated on that side, or on both sides of the vehicle when the hazard warning lights are activated.\n\nHowever, the context does not explicitly state that the DRLs can be manually deactivated by the driver. The information provided suggests that the ability to deactivate the DRLs may be limited or controlled by the vehicle's design and features, rather than being a user-configurable option.\n\nTherefore, based on the given context, it is not clear if the DRLs can be deactivated by the driver.

I need to look through the provided context to find the answer.\n\nFirst, the context mentions that to set a desired speed, you turn on Cruise Control, reach the speed, then press SET (+) or SET (-). The SET buttons are used to set the speed once the vehicle is at the desired speed.

Also, if ACC is set below 20 mph, it defaults to 20 mph. But the main question is about changing the speed once it's set.\n\nThe context says that when you want to change the speed, you can use the SET (+) or SET (-) buttons again.

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking what's special about power windows based on the provided context. I need to go through the context and pick out the key features that make them unique or notable.\n\nFirst, the context mentions that power windows allow movement with a button push. But that's pretty standard for power windows. Then there's the Auto-Down feature specifically for the driver and front passenger doors. The Auto-Down is highlighted multiple times. So maybe that's a special feature. The user has to push the switch past a detent to trigger the automatic lowering. Also, there's a way to stop the window mid-way by pulling up the switch. \n\nAnother point is the safety warnings. The context warns about not leaving children unattended because they can get trapped. Also, there's no anti-pinch protection when the window is almost closed. That's important because some systems have anti-pinch, but these don't. \n\nThe power window switches stay active for 10 minutes after turning off the ignition, which is a convenience feature but also a safety concern if kids are around. Opening the front door cancels this. Also, there are rear window switches on the center console. \n\nPutting this together, the main special features are the Auto-Down function, the ability to stop the window mid-operation, the 10-minute post-ignition activity, and the safety warnings regarding children and lack of anti-pinch. The answer should focus on the Auto-Down as the primary special feature, along with the method to stop it and the safety aspects.\n</think>\n\nThe special features of the power windows include the **Auto-Down function** for the driver and front passenger door switches. When the switch is pushed down past a detent and released, the window automatically lowers fully. Additionally, users can stop the window mid-operation by briefly pulling up on the switch during Auto-Down. The system also allows partial opening by briefly pressing the switch without passing the detent. Safety warnings emphasize no anti-pinch protection when windows are nearly closed and risks of entrapment for unattended children. The switches remain active for 10 minutes after the ignition is turned off, canceling when a front door is opened. Rear passenger windows are controlled via switches on the center console.",
