      "question": "What should I pay attention to for the clutch pedal?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the provided context, here are the key things to pay attention to regarding the clutch pedal:\n\n1. Fully press the clutch pedal before shifting gears. Pressing the clutch pedal all the way down is necessary when changing gears to prevent damage to the transmission.\n\n2. As you release the clutch pedal, lightly press the accelerator pedal. This coordination of the clutch and accelerator is important for smooth gear shifts.\n\n3. Certain noise from the transmission may be noticeable when the clutch is engaged (pedal released). This noise is normal and not an indication of a problem with the clutch or transmission.\n\n4. Ensure the carpet is securely attached and does not interfere with the operation of the clutch pedal. Unattached or improperly placed carpet could get stuck under the clutch pedal and cause a loss of vehicle control.\n\nIn summary, focus on fully pressing and properly releasing the clutch pedal during gear shifts, be aware of normal transmission noises, and ensure the floor carpet does not impact clutch pedal operation.",
      "generated_response": "When it comes to the clutch pedal, keep the following points in mind:\n\n1. **Clearance & Interference**  \n   - Before you put the floor mats back, **fully depress the clutch pedal** (as well as the accelerator and brake pedals) to make sure nothing\u2014such as a floor\u2011mat edge or loose object\u2014gets caught under the pedal.  \n   - Verify that the pedal moves freely through its full travel without hitting the accelerator or brake pedals.\n\n2. **Shifting Procedure**  \n   - **Press the clutch pedal all the way down** before you attempt to move the gear lever.  \n   - As you **release the clutch**, gently apply the accelerator. This smooth \u201cbite\u2011point\u201d transition helps prevent jerky starts and protects the transmission.\n\n3. **Noise Awareness**  \n   - Some transmission noise (especially when the vehicle is idling in neutral with the clutch engaged) is normal and not a sign of a problem.  \n   - If the noise becomes unusually loud, rattly, or is accompanied by clutch slip or difficulty shifting, it may warrant a check\u2011up.\n\n4. **Safety \u2013 Keep the Floor Area Clear**  \n   - Make sure no objects can slide or fall into the driver\u2019s side floor area while the vehicle is moving, as they could become trapped under the clutch (or accelerator/brake) pedal and affect control.\n\nBy watching for pedal interference, using the proper full\u2011press\u2011and\u2011release technique, and keeping the floor area free of debris, you\u2019ll maintain safe and reliable clutch operation.",

Press the heated steering wheel button once to turn the heating element on. Press the button again to turn the heating element off. Remember, the engine must be running for the heated steering wheel to operate. Additionally, be cautious as the heating element can cause burns, especially if used for long periods, so individuals with certain physical conditions should be extra careful when using it. Do not place anything on the steering wheel that insulates against heat to avoid overheating.",

Covering the wheel can cause the heater to overheat and may prevent it from turning on.\n\n2. **Locate the heated\u2011steering\u2011wheel button**  \n   \u2013 The physical button is on the centre of the instrument panel, directly below the radio screen.  \n   \u2013 The same function can also be accessed on the touchscreen: go to **Climate** (or **Controls**) and look for the heated\u2011steering\u2011wheel icon.\n\n3. **Turn the heater on**  \n   \u2013 Press the button **once** (or tap the icon on the screen). The heating element inside the wheel will engage.  \n   \u2013 The system has only one temperature setting, so there is no need to adjust a level.\n\n4. **Turn the heater off**  \n   \u2013 Press the same button a second time (or tap the icon again) to deactivate the heater.\n\n5. **Alternative activation via U\u2011Connect Comfort menu**  \n   \u2013 If you prefer to have the heater turn on automatically, open the **U\u2011Connect Settings** \u2192 **Comfort** menu and program the heated\u2011steering\u2011wheel (and/or heated seat) to turn on when you start the vehicle.\n\n**Additional notes**\n\n- The heater stays on until you manually turn it off; it does **not** automatically shut off.  \n- If the wheel is already warm, the system may not activate \u2013 this is normal.  \n- People with reduced skin sensation (e.g., due to age, diabetes, medication, etc.) should use the heater with caution to avoid burns.  \n\nBy following these steps you\u2019ll have a warm steering wheel ready for cold\u2011weather driving.",
