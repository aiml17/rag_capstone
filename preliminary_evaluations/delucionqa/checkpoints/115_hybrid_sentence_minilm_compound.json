      "question": "Can I deactivate the DRLs?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the provided context, it seems that the ability to deactivate the Daytime Running Lights (DRLs) depends on the specific vehicle and the market it is sold in.\n\nFor vehicles sold in Canada, the context indicates that the headlight switch does not have an \"OFF\" detent. Instead, the headlights will be deactivated when the headlight switch is placed in the parking lights position. However, the DRLs will still be activated along with the front and rear marker lights in this scenario.\n\nThe context also mentions that the DRLs may be deactivated when the parking brake is engaged, and that for vehicles sold in Canada, the DRLs will automatically deactivate when the front fog lights are turned on.\n\nAdditionally, the context states that on some vehicles, the Daytime Running Lights may deactivate or reduce intensity on one side of the vehicle when a turn signal is activated on that side, or on both sides of the vehicle when the hazard warning lights are activated.\n\nHowever, the context does not explicitly state that the DRLs can be manually deactivated by the driver. The information provided suggests that the ability to deactivate the DRLs may be limited or controlled by the vehicle's design and features, rather than being a user-configurable option.\n\nTherefore, based on the given context, it is not clear if the DRLs can be deactivated by the driver. The ability to deactivate them may depend on the specific vehicle model and market regulations.",

The only deactivation methods described are the ones above.\n\n### Summary of when you can deactivate the DRLs\n| Condition | Effect on DRLs |\n|-----------|----------------|\n| **Parking brake engaged** | DRLs turn off |\n| **Front fog lights on (Canada\u2011spec vehicles)** | DRLs turn off |\n| **Turn signal activated (some models)** | DRL on that side may dim or turn off |\n| **Hazard lights activated (some models)** | DRLs on both sides may dim or turn off |\n| **No such condition** | DRLs remain active whenever low beams are off and the vehicle is running (or moving, for manual transmissions) |\n\n### Bottom line\n- **You can deactivate the DRLs** by:\n  1. Engaging the parking brake, **or**\n  2. (If you have a Canadian\u2011spec vehicle) turning on the front fog lights.\n\n- **There is no general \u201coff\u201d switch** for the DRLs beyond these built\u2011in behaviors.
