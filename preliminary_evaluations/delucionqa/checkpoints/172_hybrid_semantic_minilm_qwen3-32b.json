I need to look at the context provided to find the answer.\n\nFirst, the context mentions \"Automatic SOS \u2014 If Equipped\" and describes it as a hands-free safety service that connects you with help if the vehicle's airbags deploy. So, the key point here is the airbags deploying. That seems to be the trigger for the Automatic SOS.\n\nThen, there's a section about the SOS Call button, which is different. The user might confuse the Automatic SOS with the SOS Call button. The question specifically asks about Automatic SOS, so the answer should focus on airbag deployment, not pressing a button. The FAQs mention using the SOS button for emergency assistance, but that's a manual action. The Automatic SOS is automatic and happens when airbags deploy.\n\nI should make sure there's no other trigger mentioned. The context doesn't say anything else about Automatic SOS being triggered by other events. So the answer is when the airbags deploy.\n</think>\n\nThe Automatic SOS will be triggered **when the vehicle\u2019s airbags deploy**.

      "question": "What should I pay attention to for the clutch pedal?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the provided context, here are the key things to pay attention to regarding the clutch pedal:\n\n1. Fully press the clutch pedal before shifting gears. Pressing the clutch pedal all the way down is necessary when changing gears to prevent damage to the transmission.\n\n2. As you release the clutch pedal, lightly press the accelerator pedal. This coordination of the clutch and accelerator is important for smooth gear shifts.\n\n3. Certain noise from the transmission may be noticeable when the clutch is engaged (pedal released). This noise is normal and not an indication of a problem with the clutch or transmission.\n\n4. Ensure the carpet is securely attached and does not interfere with the operation of the clutch pedal. Unattached or improperly placed carpet could get stuck under the clutch pedal and cause a loss of vehicle control.\n\nIn summary, focus on fully pressing and properly releasing the clutch pedal during gear shifts, be aware of normal transmission noises, and ensure the floor carpet does not impact clutch pedal operation.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking what they should pay attention to regarding the clutch pedal based on the provided context. Let me go through the context again to make sure I don't miss anything.\n\nFirst, the context mentions shifting gears: \"Shifting Fully press the clutch pedal before shifting gears. As you release the clutch pedal, lightly press the accelerator pedal.\" So when shifting, pressing the clutch fully is important. That's probably a key point.\n\nThen there's a part about checking pedals for interference: \"Fully depress each pedal to check for interference with the accelerator, brake, or clutch pedals then re-install the floor mats.\" So when checking the pedals, you need to make sure pressing each one fully doesn't interfere with the others. This relates to the clutch pedal as well, so maybe checking for interference is another point.\n\nThe note about transmission noise says that some noise is normal when the clutch is engaged (pedal released) or when driving. But that's more about noise being normal, not something to pay attention to in terms of operation. The carpet safety info says to use carpets that don't interfere with pedals and secure them with grommets. If the carpet isn't secure, it could interfere with the pedals. So ensuring the floor mats don't block the clutch pedal movement is important.\n\nAlso, there's a warning about objects falling into the driver's floor area, which could get under the pedals. So keeping the area clear of objects that might interfere with the clutch pedal is another point.\n\nPutting this all together, the main things to pay attention to for the clutch pedal are: fully pressing it when shifting gears, checking for pedal interference when installing floor mats, ensuring floor mats are secure to prevent interference, and keeping the area clear of objects that could block the pedal. The answer should include these points concisely.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: When using the clutch pedal, ensure it is fully depressed before shifting gears. Check for interference with the accelerator, brake, or clutch pedals when installing floor mats, and confirm the mats are securely attached to prevent movement. Avoid placing objects on the floor that could obstruct pedal operation. Normal transmission noise when the clutch is engaged (pedal released) is not a concern. Always use properly fitting floor mats to prevent pedal interference and maintain safe vehicle control.",

However, the DRLs will still be activated along with the front and rear marker lights in this scenario.\n\nThe context also mentions that the DRLs may be deactivated when the parking brake is engaged, and that for vehicles sold in Canada, the DRLs will automatically deactivate when the front fog lights are turned on.\n\nAdditionally, the context states that on some vehicles, the Daytime Running Lights may deactivate or reduce intensity on one side of the vehicle when a turn signal is activated on that side, or on both sides of the vehicle when the hazard warning lights are activated.\n\nHowever, the context does not explicitly state that the DRLs can be manually deactivated by the driver.

      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the context provided, the SOS Call button on the vehicle's overhead console has the following functionalities:\n\n1. Initiating an SOS call to an SOS operator:\n   - Pushing the SOS Call button will initiate a call to an SOS operator.\n   - The SOS Call system will transmit important vehicle information to the SOS operator, including the vehicle brand, last known GPS coordinates, and an indication that the occupant placed an SOS call.\n\n2. Cancellation of the SOS call:\n   - There is a 10-second delay before the SOS Call system initiates the call to the SOS operator.\n   - During this 10-second delay, the SOS Call can be canceled by pushing the SOS Call button again or by pressing the cancellation button on the device screen.\n   - Terminating the SOS Call will turn off the green LED light on the overhead console.\n\n3. Voice connection with the SOS operator:\n   - Once the SOS Call connection is established, the occupants can speak with the SOS operator through the vehicle's audio system to determine if additional help is needed.\n\n4. Emergency response assistance:\n   - The SOS operator may attempt to contact appropriate emergency responders and provide them with the vehicle's important information and GPS coordinates.\n\nIn summary, the SOS Call button allows the vehicle occupants to initiate an emergency call, communicate with the SOS operator, and potentially receive emergency assistance if needed.",
