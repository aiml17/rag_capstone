      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the provided context, here are the key things to pay attention to regarding the clutch pedal:\n\n1. Fully press the clutch pedal before shifting gears. Pressing the clutch pedal all the way down is necessary when changing gears to prevent damage to the transmission.\n\n2. As you release the clutch pedal, lightly press the accelerator pedal. This coordination of the clutch and accelerator is important for smooth gear shifts.\n\n3. Certain noise from the transmission may be noticeable when the clutch is engaged (pedal released). This noise is normal and not an indication of a problem with the clutch or transmission.\n\n4. Ensure the carpet is securely attached and does not interfere with the operation of the clutch pedal. Unattached or improperly placed carpet could get stuck under the clutch pedal and cause a loss of vehicle control.\n\nIn summary, focus on fully pressing and properly releasing the clutch pedal during gear shifts, be aware of normal transmission noises, and ensure the floor carpet does not impact clutch pedal operation.",

Only operate the vehicle when the carpet is securely attached by the grommets so it cannot slip out of position and interfere with the pedal assemblies or impair safe operation of your vehicle in other ways. WARNING: If operating the vehicle without carpet in place the floor may become hot, and there is a risk of burns.",

Instead, the headlights will be deactivated when the headlight switch is placed in the parking lights position. However, the DRLs will still be activated along with the front and rear marker lights in this scenario.\n\nThe context also mentions that the DRLs may be deactivated when the parking brake is engaged, and that for vehicles sold in Canada, the DRLs will automatically deactivate when the front fog lights are turned on.\n\nAdditionally, the context states that on some vehicles, the Daytime Running Lights may deactivate or reduce intensity on one side of the vehicle when a turn signal is activated on that side, or on both sides of the vehicle when the hazard warning lights are activated.\n\nHowever, the context does not explicitly state that the DRLs can be manually deactivated by the driver.

      "question": "Any tips about how to keep the air inside fresh?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the given context, here are some tips to help keep the air inside the vehicle fresh:\n\n1. Maintain the outside air intake: Ensure the air intake located in front of the windshield is free of obstructions, such as leaves. Blocked air intake can reduce airflow and potentially lead to issues like water drains getting plugged.\n\n2. Avoid excessive recirculation: Refrain from using the recirculation mode for extended periods without the air conditioning (A/C) on. Prolonged use of recirculation mode can lead to fogging and poor air quality inside the vehicle.\n\n3. Use the climate control system effectively: Utilize the Defrost or Mix mode and increase the front blower speed to clear any fogging on the windows. This helps maintain good visibility and air circulation.\n\n4. Manage the A/C system: If the A/C performance seems lower than expected, check the front of the A/C condenser (located in front of the radiator) for any dirt or insect accumulation. Clean the condenser with a gentle water spray to improve the A/C's effectiveness.\n\n5. Avoid excessive engine heat buildup: If the engine is experiencing severe and abnormal overheating, stop the vehicle, turn off the engine, and allow it to cool. Seek immediate service and a tune-up to manufacturer's specifications to address the issue, as this can help maintain proper air quality and prevent any potential odors.\n\nBy following these tips, you can help keep the air inside the vehicle fresh and improve the overall cabin environment.",
