        " Automatic SOS \u2014 If Equipped Automatic SOS is a hands-free safety service that can immediately connect you with help in the event that your vehicle\u2019s airbags deploy.  Please refer to your provided radio supplement for complete information.\n\n SOS Call Push the SOS Call button on the overhead console.  Note: in case the sos call button is pushed in error, there will be a 10 second delay before the sos call system initiates a call to an sos operator.  To cancel the SOS Call connection, push the SOS call button on the overhead console or press the cancellation button on the Device Screen.  Termination of the SOS Call will turn off the green LED light on the overhead console.  The LED light located within the ASSIST and SOS buttons on the overhead console will turn green once a connection to an SOS operator has been made.  Once a connection between the vehicle and an sos operator is made, the sos call system may transmit the following important vehicle information to an sos operator: indication that the occupant placed an sos call.  The vehicle brand.  The last known GPS coordinates of the vehicle.  You should be able to speak with the SOS operator through the vehicle audio system to determine if additional help is needed.  Warning: always obey traffic laws and pay attention to the road.  ALWAYS drive safely with your hands on the steering wheel.  You have full responsibility and assume all risks related to the use of the features and applications in this vehicle.  Only use the features and applications when it is safe to do so.  Failure to do so may result in an accident involving serious injury or death.  Note: your vehicle may be transmitting data as authorized by the subscriber.  Once a connection is made between the vehicle\u2019s SOS Call system and the SOS operator, the SOS operator may be able to open a voice connection with the vehicle to determine if additional help is needed.  Once the SOS operator opens a voice connection with the vehicle\u2019s SOS Call system, the operator should be able to speak with the vehicle occupants, and hear sounds occurring in the vehicle.  The vehicle\u2019s SOS Call system will attempt to remain connected with the SOS operator until the SOS operator terminates the connection.  The SOS operator may attempt to contact appropriate emergency responders and provide them with important vehicle information and GPS coordinates.  WARNING: If anyone in the vehicle could be in danger (e.g., fire or smoke is visible, dangerous road conditions or location), do not wait for voice contact from an Emergency Services Agent.  All occupants should exit the vehicle immediately and move to a safe location.  Never place anything on or near the vehicle\u2019s operable network and GPS antennas.  You could prevent operable network and GPS signal reception, which can prevent your vehicle from placing an emergency call.  An operable network and GPS signal reception is required for the SOS Call system to function properly.  The SOS Call system is embedded into the vehicle\u2019s electrical system.  Do not add aftermarket electrical equipment to the vehicle\u2019s electrical system.  This may prevent your vehicle from sending a signal to initiate an emergency call.  To avoid interference that can cause the SOS Call system to fail, never add aftermarket equipment (e.g., two-way mobile radio, CB radio, data recorder, etc.)  to your vehicle\u2019s electrical system or modify the antennas on your vehicle.  IF YOUR VEHICLE LOSES BATTERY POWER FOR ANY REASON (INCLUDING DURING OR AFTER AN ACCIDENT), THE UCONNECT FEATURES, APPS AND SERVICES, AMONG OTHERS, WILL NOT OPERATE.

      "generated_response": "**How to Jump\u2011Start Your Vehicle \u2013 Full Procedure and Safety Guidance**\n\nBelow is a complete, step\u2011by\u2011step guide that incorporates every safety precaution and preparation mentioned in the provided material. Follow the steps in order; skipping any of them can cause personal injury, battery explosion, or damage to the vehicles\u2019 electrical systems.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Prepare Both Vehicles\n\n| Action | Why It Matters |\n|--------|----------------|\n| **Apply the parking brake** on your car (and on the donor vehicle). | Prevents the cars from moving while cables are connected. |\n| **Shift transmission to PARK (automatic) or NEUTRAL (manual).** | Guarantees the vehicle won\u2019t roll. |\n| **Turn the ignition to OFF** on both vehicles. | Stops the starter and other loads from drawing current while you make connections. |\n| **Turn off all accessories** (heater, radio, lights, wipers, etc.). | Reduces electrical load and the chance of sparks. |\n| **Park the donor vehicle close enough** that the jumper\u2011cable clamps can reach both batteries, but **do not let the vehicles touch** each other. | Prevents an unintended ground connection that could cause a short. |\n| **Raise the hoods** and **stay clear of the radiator cooling fan** (it can spin on its own when the ignition is ON). | Avoids serious injury from moving fan blades. |\n| **Remove metal jewelry** (rings, watches, bracelets). | Prevents accidental electrical contact that could cause burns or shock. |\n\n---\n\n### 2. Locate and Access the Battery\n\n* **Location:** Right\u2011rear of the engine compartment.  \n* **If equipped with Stop/Start:** There are two batteries; **use only the main battery\u2019s positive post** for jump\u2011starting.  \n* **Positive (+) post:** Covered with a protective cap \u2013 lift the cap to expose the post.  \n\n> **Important:** Never attempt to jump\u2011start from the supplemental battery; doing so can cause serious injury or death.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Safety Precautions Before Connecting Cables\n\n1. **Do not use any booster source >\u202f12\u202fV.**  \n2. **Do not use a \u201cfast charger\u201d to start the engine.** (If a fast charger is used for charging, disconnect both vehicle battery cables first.)  \n3. **Keep flames, sparks, and smoking materials away** from the battery (hydrogen gas is flammable).  \n4. **Do not let the cable clamps touch each other** at any time.  \n5. **Avoid contact between the clamps and any metal parts** of the vehicle other than the intended battery terminals.  \n6. **Wash your hands** after handling the battery, as terminals contain lead/lead compounds.  \n\n---\n\n### 4. Connect the Jumper Cables (Correct Polarity)\n\n| Cable | Connect To |\n|-------|------------|\n| **Red (positive) clamp** | **Positive (+) post** on the **dead** battery (your car). |\n| **Red (positive) clamp** (other end) | **Positive (+) post** on the **donor** battery. |\n| **Black (negative) clamp** | **Negative (\u2013) post** on the **donor** battery. |\n| **Black (negative) clamp** (other end) | **Unpainted metal surface** on the **engine block or chassis** of the dead\u2011vehicle (away from the battery). This serves as a ground and reduces the risk of sparks near the battery. |\n\n* **Never connect the negative clamp to the dead battery\u2019s negative post** \u2013 that can cause a spark near the battery\u2019s hydrogen gas.  \n\n* **Make sure the unused ends of the cables are not touching each other or any part of either vehicle** while you are making the connections.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Start the Donor Vehicle\n\n1. **Start the donor vehicle** and let it run at idle (or slightly higher RPM) for a few minutes.  \n2. This allows its alternator to charge the dead battery through the cables.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Attempt to Start Your Vehicle\n\n1. **Turn the ignition key (or press the start button) on your vehicle.**  \n2. If the engine cranks and starts, **keep the engine running** for at least **5\u201310 minutes** (or drive for a while) to allow the alternator to recharge the battery.  \n\n*If the engine does not start after a few attempts, wait a minute and try again. Do **not** keep cranking for more than a few seconds at a time to avoid overheating the starter.*\n\n---\n\n### 7. Disconnect the Cables (Reverse Order)\n\n1. **Remove the black (negative) clamp** from the engine block/chassis of the jumped vehicle.  \n2. **Remove the black (negative) clamp** from the donor battery.  \n3. **Remove the red (positive) clamp** from the donor battery.  \n4. **Remove the red (positive) clamp** from your vehicle\u2019s battery.  \n\n*Always keep the clamps away from each other while removing them.*\n\n---\n\n### 8. After\u2011Jump\u2011Start Checks\n\n* **Inspect the battery terminals** for corrosion; clean if necessary.  \n* **Verify that all electrical accessories** (lights, radio, etc.) work properly.  \n* **If the battery repeatedly discharges**, have it tested or replaced \u2013 a jump start is only a temporary fix.  \n\n---\n\n### 9. Additional Warnings & Situations to Avoid\n\n| Situation | Reason |\n|-----------|--------|\n| **Battery is frozen** | Attempting to jump\u2011start a frozen battery can cause it to rupture or explode. |\n| **Using a booster pack >\u202f12\u202fV** | Can damage the battery, starter motor, alternator, or vehicle electronics. |\n| **Using a fast charger to start** | Fast chargers are not designed for the high current needed to crank an engine. |\n| **Allowing the vehicles to touch** | May create a ground path and cause a short or personal injury. |\n| **Contact with the cooling fan** | Fan blades can start moving as soon as the ignition is ON, causing injury. |\n| **Contact with battery acid** | Sulfuric acid can burn skin/eyes; wear gloves if possible and wash hands afterward. |\n\n---\n\n### Quick Checklist (for reference while you work)\n\n- [ ] Parking brake applied on both cars  \n- [ ] Transmission in PARK/NEUTRAL, ignition OFF  \n- [ ] All accessories OFF  \n- [ ] Vehicles positioned, not touching, within cable reach  \n- [ ] Positive caps removed, positive clamps on (+) posts  \n- [ ] Negative clamp on donor battery, other negative clamp on engine block/chassis of dead car  \n- [ ] Donor engine running, cables secure, no clamps touching each other  \n- [ ] Attempt start, keep donor running  \n- [ ] Once started, keep engine running 5\u201110\u202fmin  \n- [ ] Disconnect in reverse order, keep clamps apart  \n\n---\n\n**By following this complete procedure and observing every safety warning, you can safely jump\u2011start your vehicle without risking injury or damage.**",

      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the provided context, here are the key things to pay attention to regarding the clutch pedal:\n\n1. Fully press the clutch pedal before shifting gears. Pressing the clutch pedal all the way down is necessary when changing gears to prevent damage to the transmission.\n\n2. As you release the clutch pedal, lightly press the accelerator pedal. This coordination of the clutch and accelerator is important for smooth gear shifts.\n\n3. Certain noise from the transmission may be noticeable when the clutch is engaged (pedal released). This noise is normal and not an indication of a problem with the clutch or transmission.\n\n4. Ensure the carpet is securely attached and does not interfere with the operation of the clutch pedal. Unattached or improperly placed carpet could get stuck under the clutch pedal and cause a loss of vehicle control.\n\nIn summary, focus on fully pressing and properly releasing the clutch pedal during gear shifts, be aware of normal transmission noises, and ensure the floor carpet does not impact clutch pedal operation.",
      "generated_response": "**Things to watch for with the clutch pedal**\n\n1. **Use it correctly when shifting**  \n   * Press the clutch pedal **fully down** before you move the gear lever.  \n   * As you **release** the clutch, give the accelerator a light press to match engine speed.\n\n2. **Make sure nothing interferes with the pedal**  \n   * The floor carpet must be the correct size and **securely fastened with its grommets**.  \n   * Verify that the carpet (or any floor\u2011mat) does **not** touch or block the clutch pedal\u2019s travel.  \n   * After reinstalling carpet or mats, **fully depress the clutch** (and the other pedals) to confirm there is no binding.\n\n3. **Keep the pedal area clear**  \n   * Do not place towels, keys, tools, or other objects under the carpet or around the pedal.  \n   * Objects in that space can shift, change the pedal\u2019s position, and cause a loss of control.\n\n4. **Check for normal noises**  \n   * Some transmission noise can be heard when the clutch is engaged (pedal released) while the vehicle is idling in neutral. This is normal and not a clutch problem.\n\nBy following the shifting technique and ensuring the carpet and floor\u2011mats are properly installed and free of debris, you\u2019ll keep the clutch pedal operating safely and reliably.",
      "retrieved_chunks": [
        " Shifting Fully press the clutch pedal before shifting gears.  As you release the clutch pedal, lightly press the accelerator pedal.  You should always use FIRST gear when starting from a standing position.  Note: A certain amount of noise from the transmission is normal.  This noise can be most noticeable when the vehicle is idling in NEUTRAL with the clutch engaged (clutch pedal released), but it may also be heard when driving.  The noise may also be more noticeable when the transmission is warm.  This noise is normal and is not an indication of a problem with your clutch or transmission.\n\n Before Climbing A Steep Hill As you approach a hill, consider its grade or steepness.  Determine if it is too steep.  Look to see what the traction is on the hill side trail.  Is the trail straight up and down?  What is on top and the other side?  Are there ruts, rocks, branches or other obstacles on the path?  Can you safely recover the vehicle if something goes wrong?  If everything looks good and you feel confident, shift the transmission into a lower gear with 4L engaged, and proceed with caution, maintaining your momentum as you climb the hill.\n\n Carpet Safety Information Always use carpet designed to fit your vehicle.  Only use carpet that does not interfere with the operation of the pedal assemblies.  Only operate the vehicle when the carpet is securely attached by the grommets so it cannot slip out of position and interfere with the pedal assemblies or impair safe operation of your vehicle in other ways.  WARNING: If operating the vehicle without carpet in place the floor may become hot, and there is a risk of burns.  An improperly attached, damaged, folded, or damaged grommets may cause your carpet to interfere with the accelerator, brake, or clutch pedals and cause a loss of vehicle control.  To prevent SERIOUS INJURY or DEATH: ALWAYS securely attach your carpet using the grommets.  ALWAYS make sure objects cannot fall or slide into the driver\u2019s side floor area when the vehicle is moving.  Objects can become trapped under accelerator, brake, or clutch pedals and could cause a loss of vehicle control.  NEVER place any objects under the carpet (e.g., towels, keys, etc.).  These objects could change the position of the carpet and may cause interference with the accelerator, brake, or clutch pedals.  ONLY install carpet designed to fit your vehicle.  NEVER install carpet that cannot be properly attached and secured to your vehicle.  If the carpet needs to be replaced, only use manufacturer approved carpet for the specific make, model, and year of your vehicle.  If the vehicle carpet has been removed and re-installed, always properly attach carpet to the floor and check that the floor mat fasteners are secure to the vehicle carpet.  Fully depress each pedal to check for interference with the accelerator, brake, or clutch pedals then re-install the floor mats."

Launch Android Auto\n\n- **Automatic launch:** Android\u202fAuto is set to start **immediately** once a compatible device is recognized.  \n- **Manual launch:** If it does not start automatically, tap the **Android Auto icon** that replaces the Phone icon on the U\u2011Connect drag\u2011and\u2011drop menu bar (or on the main touchscreen).  \n\nYou will now see the Android\u202fAuto interface on the vehicle\u2019s display: simple \u201ccards\u201d for navigation, music, messages, etc.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Use voice control (optional but recommended)\n\n1. **Steering\u2011wheel VR button:** Press and hold the **Voice Recognition (VR) button** on the steering wheel.  \n2. **On\u2011screen microphone:** Or press and hold the **Microphone icon** inside Android\u202fAuto.  \n\nThis activates Google Assistant, letting you issue natural\u2011language commands such as \u201cNavigate to 123 Main St,\u201d \u201cPlay Spotify,\u201d \u201cRead my messages,\u201d or \u201cCall Mom.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### 6. (Optional) Set up **wireless** Android Auto  \n\nIf your vehicle and phone support wireless Android Auto:\n\n1. Ensure both the car\u2019s infotainment system and the phone have **Bluetooth** and **Wi\u2011Fi** turned on.  \n2. Pair the phone to the car via Bluetooth (the usual \u201cAdd Phone\u201d process).  \n3. After the initial wired setup (steps\u202f1\u20114), the system will remember the phone and will connect wirelessly when the car is started and the phone is in the vehicle.  \n\n> **Tip:** Wireless Android Auto still requires a compatible phone and an active data plan.\n\n---\n\n### 7. Confirm the connection\n\n- The **Phone icon** on the drag\u2011and\u2011drop menu bar changes to the **Android Auto icon**.  \n- In the upper\u2011right corner of the radio screen you\u2019ll see a **cellular\u2011coverage indicator** showing that data is being used.  \n- The Android Auto home screen shows the list of **compatible apps** (Spotify, YouTube\u202fMusic, iHeartRadio, etc.).  \n\nIf any app you want to use does **not** appear, make sure it is **installed and you are signed in** on the phone.\n\n---\n\n### 8. Troubleshooting quick\u2011check list\n\n| Symptom | Check |\n|---------|-------|\n| Android Auto does not start | \u2022 Phone in PARK? <br>\u2022 Using factory USB cable? <br>\u2022 Phone OS \u2265\u202f6.0? <br>\u2022 App installed & up\u2011to\u2011date? |\n| No data icon / \u201cNo service\u201d | \u2022 Cellular coverage in area? <br>\u2022 Data plan active? |\n| Voice commands not responding | \u2022 Permissions granted (Microphone, Location)? <br>\u2022 VR button or microphone icon being held correctly? |\n| App missing from Android Auto screen | \u2022 App installed on phone? <br>\u2022 Signed into the app? <br>\u2022 App listed as Android Auto\u2011compatible? |\n\n---\n\n### 9. Summary checklist (quick reference)\n\n- [ ] Android\u202f6.0+ phone with active data plan  \n- [ ] Android Auto app installed (Google\u202fPlay)  \n- [ ] Vehicle in **PARK** (first use)  \n- [ ] Factory USB cable plugged into a **media** USB port  \n- [ ] Grant all permissions on the phone when prompted  \n- [ ] Android Auto launches automatically **or** tap the Android Auto icon  \n- [ ] Use steering\u2011wheel VR button or on\u2011screen mic for voice control  \n- [ ] (Optional) Set up wireless connection after the first wired setup  \n\nOnce these steps are completed, Android Auto will be fully functional, allowing you to stream music, navigate, send/receive messages, and control many other apps\u2014all while keeping your hands on the wheel and eyes on the road.",

If it detects a Passive Entry key fob inside the vehicle, the vehicle will unlock and alert the customer.  If Passive Entry is disabled using the Uconnect system, the key fob protection described in this section remains active/functional.  When a door is open and the interior lights are on, rotating the instrument panel dimmer control to the extreme bottom position will cause all the interior lights to turn off.  This allows the doors to stay open for extended periods of time without discharging the vehicle\u2019s battery.  Be sure the hood is fully latched before driving your vehicle.  If the hood is not fully latched, it could open when the vehicle is in motion and block your vision.  Failure to follow this warning could result in serious injury or death.  The doors have to be open and then closed in order for the vehicle to check for the presence of a key fob; the Key Left Vehicle feature will not activate until all of the doors are closed.

The key fob allows you to lock or unlock the doors and tailgate from distances up to approximately 66 ft (20 m).  The key fob does not need to be pointed at the vehicle to activate the system.  The key fob also contains a mechanical key.  When any of these situations occur, after all open doors are closed, the FOBIK-Safe search will be executed.
