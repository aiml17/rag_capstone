The context provided mentions \"Automatic SOS \u2014 If Equipped\" as a hands-free safety service that connects you with help if the vehicle's airbags deploy.

The question specifically asks about Automatic SOS, which is different from the manual SOS Call. The automatic one is triggered by the airbag deployment, while the manual one requires pressing the button. The answer should focus on the airbag deployment as the trigger for the Automatic SOS. Also, the FAQs mention accidental presses of the SOS button but that's for the manual call, not the automatic feature.

First, I need to go through the context carefully.\n\nThe context mentions that the battery is located in the right rear of the engine compartment.

The preparation steps include applying the parking brake, shifting to PARK (for automatic) or NEUTRAL (manual), and turning the ignition off. \n\nThen, under the JUMP STARTING section, it says you can use another vehicle with jumper cables or a portable booster.

Wait, maybe the user needs to connect the jumper cables to the main battery's positive and the other car's battery. Also, the context says not to use the supplemental battery for jump starting. \n\nWait, the exact warning is: \"Only use the positive battery post on the main battery to jump start your vehicle.

To unlock all the doors, push and release the unlock button twice.\"",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking how to use the key fob to unlock all the doors. I need to refer to the provided context to find the correct answer.\n\nLooking at the context, the first part says: \"To Lock/Unlock The Doors And Tailgate Push and release the unlock button on the key fob once to unlock the driver\u2019s door, or twice to unlock all the doors.\" So, pressing the unlock button once unlocks the driver's door, pressing it twice unlocks all doors. That seems straightforward.\n\nI should make sure there's no other information that might affect this. The context also mentions that the key fob can be used up to 66 feet away and doesn't need to be pointed at the car. Also, there's a note about programming all doors to unlock on the first push via Uconnect Settings, but the default is that pressing twice unlocks all doors. The answer should stick to the standard method unless the user specifies they've changed the settings, but since the question doesn't mention that, the default method applies.\n\nSo the answer is to press the unlock button twice. I need to present this clearly, maybe in steps. Also, mention the tailgate if relevant, but the question is about doors. The mechanical key is mentioned, but the user is asking about the key fob. The Key Left Vehicle feature is about alerts, not unlocking, so not relevant here. The answer should be concise, just the method from the context.\n</think>\n\nTo unlock all the doors using the key fob, press and release the **unlock button twice**. This action will unlock all doors. If the vehicle is equipped with Uconnect Settings, users can also program all doors to unlock on the first press of the unlock button, but the default behavior (as described) requires two presses.

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking what's special about power windows based on the provided context. Let me read through the context again to make sure I don't miss anything.\n\nThe context starts by explaining that power windows allow moving windows with a button push. The switches are located on the instrument panel below the climate controls. Then it mentions that occupants, especially unattended children, can get entrapped by the windows when using the switches. Also, the switches stay active for up to 10 minutes after the ignition is turned off. There's a note that a child could operate the windows or other controls, or even move the vehicle. Finally, it specifies that the driver and front passenger door switches have an Auto-Down feature: pushing the switch down past the detent and releasing makes the window go down automatically.\n\nSo the question is asking what's special about power windows. The answer should highlight the unique features mentioned. The main special features here are the Auto-Down function for the driver and front passenger doors. The context also mentions other things like the location of the switches and the 10-minute active period, but those might not be the \"special\" aspects. The Auto-Down is a specific feature that's highlighted as something extra. The entrapping risk is a safety concern, but not a special feature. So the answer should focus on the Auto-Down feature. Let me check again: the Auto-Down is when you push the switch down past the detent and release, and the window goes down automatically. That's the key point. The other info is more about safety or location, but the Auto-Down is the special feature.\n</think>\n\nThe special feature of power windows mentioned in the context is the **Auto-Down function** available on the driver and front passenger door switches.
