        " Automatic SOS \u2014 If Equipped Automatic SOS is a hands-free safety service that can immediately connect you with help in the event that your vehicle\u2019s airbags deploy.  Please refer to your provided radio supplement for complete information.\n\n SOS Call Push the SOS Call button on the overhead console.  Note: in case the sos call button is pushed in error, there will be a 10 second delay before the sos call system initiates a call to an sos operator.  To cancel the SOS Call connection, push the SOS call button on the overhead console or press the cancellation button on the Device Screen.  Termination of the SOS Call will turn off the green LED light on the overhead console.  The LED light located within the ASSIST and SOS buttons on the overhead console will turn green once a connection to an SOS operator has been made.  Once a connection between the vehicle and an sos operator is made, the sos call system may transmit the following important vehicle information to an sos operator: indication that the occupant placed an sos call.  The vehicle brand.  The last known GPS coordinates of the vehicle.  You should be able to speak with the SOS operator through the vehicle audio system to determine if additional help is needed.  Warning: always obey traffic laws and pay attention to the road.  ALWAYS drive safely with your hands on the steering wheel.  You have full responsibility and assume all risks related to the use of the features and applications in this vehicle.  Only use the features and applications when it is safe to do so.  Failure to do so may result in an accident involving serious injury or death.  Note: your vehicle may be transmitting data as authorized by the subscriber.  Once a connection is made between the vehicle\u2019s SOS Call system and the SOS operator, the SOS operator may be able to open a voice connection with the vehicle to determine if additional help is needed.  Once the SOS operator opens a voice connection with the vehicle\u2019s SOS Call system, the operator should be able to speak with the vehicle occupants, and hear sounds occurring in the vehicle.  The vehicle\u2019s SOS Call system will attempt to remain connected with the SOS operator until the SOS operator terminates the connection.  The SOS operator may attempt to contact appropriate emergency responders and provide them with important vehicle information and GPS coordinates.  WARNING: If anyone in the vehicle could be in danger (e.g., fire or smoke is visible, dangerous road conditions or location), do not wait for voice contact from an Emergency Services Agent.  All occupants should exit the vehicle immediately and move to a safe location.  Never place anything on or near the vehicle\u2019s operable network and GPS antennas.  You could prevent operable network and GPS signal reception, which can prevent your vehicle from placing an emergency call.  An operable network and GPS signal reception is required for the SOS Call system to function properly.  The SOS Call system is embedded into the vehicle\u2019s electrical system.  Do not add aftermarket electrical equipment to the vehicle\u2019s electrical system.  This may prevent your vehicle from sending a signal to initiate an emergency call.  To avoid interference that can cause the SOS Call system to fail, never add aftermarket equipment (e.g., two-way mobile radio, CB radio, data recorder, etc.)  to your vehicle\u2019s electrical system or modify the antennas on your vehicle.  IF YOUR VEHICLE LOSES BATTERY POWER FOR ANY REASON (INCLUDING DURING OR AFTER AN ACCIDENT), THE UCONNECT FEATURES, APPS AND SERVICES, AMONG OTHERS, WILL NOT OPERATE.

      "generated_response": "**How to Jump\u2011Start Your Vehicle \u2013 Full Procedure and Safety Checklist**\n\nBelow is a complete, step\u2011by\u2011step guide that incorporates every safety warning and preparation note from the owner\u2011manual excerpt. Follow the list exactly; skipping any step can cause personal injury, battery explosion, or damage to the vehicles\u2019 electrical systems.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Prepare Both Vehicles\n\n| Action | Why it matters |\n|--------|----------------|\n| **Apply the parking brake** on your car (and on the donor car). | Prevents the vehicles from moving while you\u2019re working. |\n| **Shift the transmission** \u2013 automatic to **PARK (P)**, manual to **NEUTRAL**. | Guarantees the drivetrain is disengaged. |\n| **Turn the ignition OFF** on both vehicles. | Stops the alternator and any accessories from drawing current. |\n| **Turn OFF all accessories** (heater, radio, lights, etc.). | Reduces electrical load and the chance of sparks. |\n| **Park the donor vehicle** close enough that the jumper\u2011cable clamps can reach both batteries, but **do not let the vehicles touch**. | Prevents an unintended ground connection that could cause a short. |\n| **Raise the hoods** and keep clear of the **radiator cooling fan** (it can spin on its own when the engine is off). | Avoids serious injury from moving fan blades. |\n| **Remove metal jewelry** (rings, bracelets, watches). | Prevents accidental electrical contact that could cause burns or shock. |\n| **Wash your hands** after handling battery parts (lead and lead compounds are hazardous). | Reduces exposure to toxic substances. |\n\n---\n\n### 2. Verify Battery Condition\n\n- **Do NOT attempt a jump\u2011start if the battery is frozen** \u2013 a frozen battery can rupture or explode.\n- **If the vehicle has a Stop/Start system**, it will have **two batteries**; **only use the positive post on the main (starter) battery**. The supplemental battery must **never** be used for jump\u2011starting.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Gather the Right Equipment\n\n- **Jumper cables** rated for at least 12\u202fV and appropriate amperage.\n- **Do NOT use a booster source** (portable pack, other charger, etc.) **with an output greater than 12\u202fV**. Over\u2011voltage can damage the battery, starter motor, alternator, or other electronics.\n- **If using a portable booster pack**, follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions and ensure it is a 12\u2011V unit.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Connect the Cables (Correct Polarity)\n\n1. **Identify the positive (+) post** on your car\u2019s main battery (it is covered with a protective cap \u2013 lift the cap to expose it).  \n2. **Identify the negative (\u2013) post** (or a clean, unpainted metal surface on the engine block/chassis for grounding).  \n3. **Connect the clamps in this order** (always keep the unused ends of the cables from touching each other or any metal surface):\n\n   1. **Red clamp** to the **positive (+) post** of the **dead battery** (your car).  \n   2. **Red clamp** to the **positive (+) post** of the **donor battery**.  \n   3. **Black clamp** to the **negative (\u2013) post** of the **donor battery**.  \n   4. **Black clamp** to a **ground point** on the **dead vehicle** (unpainted metal on the engine block or chassis, away from the battery).  \n\n   *Do NOT connect the black clamp to the negative post of the dead battery* \u2013 this could cause a spark near the battery\u2019s hydrogen gas.\n\n4. **Double\u2011check** that no cable ends are touching each other or any other metal parts.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Start the Donor Vehicle\n\n- **Start the engine of the donor car** and let it run for a few minutes (2\u20135\u202fmin) to allow its alternator to charge the dead battery.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Attempt to Start Your Vehicle\n\n- **Turn the ignition key** (or press the start button) on your car.  \n- If the engine cranks and starts, **let it run** for several minutes to build charge.\n\n---\n\n### 7. Disconnect the Cables (Reverse Order)\n\n1. **Remove the black clamp** from the ground point on your vehicle.  \n2. **Remove the black clamp** from the donor battery\u2019s negative post.  \n3. **Remove the red clamp** from the donor battery\u2019s positive post.  \n4. **Remove the red clamp** from your battery\u2019s positive post.  \n\n- Keep the clamps from touching each other during removal.\n\n---\n\n### 8. After\u2011Jump\u2011Start Care\n\n- Keep the engine running for at least **15\u201320 minutes** (or drive for 10\u201315\u202fminutes) to let the alternator fully recharge the battery.\n- If the vehicle stalls again shortly after, the battery may be beyond rescue and should be **replaced** or **re\u2011charged with a proper charger**.\n\n---\n\n### 9. Additional Safety Notes\n\n- **Battery gas (hydrogen) is flammable** \u2013 keep open flames, sparks, and smoking away from the battery at all times.  \n- **Do not use a \u201cfast charger\u201d** to provide starting power; it is only for charging, not for cranking.  \n- **Never allow the cable clamps to touch each other** while any connection is made; a short circuit can cause sparks, fire, or explosion.  \n- **If you notice any swelling, leakage, or cracked battery case**, do **not** attempt a jump\u2011start \u2013 replace the battery.\n\n---\n\n### Quick Checklist (for reference)\n\n- [ ] Parking brake applied, transmission in P/Neutral, ignition OFF.  \n- [ ] All accessories OFF.  \n- [ ] Vehicles positioned, not touching.  \n- [ ] No metal jewelry, fan blades avoided.  \n- [ ] Battery not frozen; only main battery\u2019s positive post used.  \n- [ ] Correct cable polarity and order of connection.  \n- [ ] Donor vehicle running, cables secure, no clamps touching.  \n- [ ] Attempt start, then disconnect in reverse order.  \n- [ ] Let engine run to recharge.\n\nFollowing this complete procedure will safely get your car started and minimize the risk of injury or damage.",

      "question": "What should I pay attention to for the clutch pedal?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the provided context, here are the key things to pay attention to regarding the clutch pedal:\n\n1. Fully press the clutch pedal before shifting gears. Pressing the clutch pedal all the way down is necessary when changing gears to prevent damage to the transmission.\n\n2. As you release the clutch pedal, lightly press the accelerator pedal. This coordination of the clutch and accelerator is important for smooth gear shifts.\n\n3. Certain noise from the transmission may be noticeable when the clutch is engaged (pedal released). This noise is normal and not an indication of a problem with the clutch or transmission.\n\n4. Ensure the carpet is securely attached and does not interfere with the operation of the clutch pedal. Unattached or improperly placed carpet could get stuck under the clutch pedal and cause a loss of vehicle control.\n\nIn summary, focus on fully pressing and properly releasing the clutch pedal during gear shifts, be aware of normal transmission noises, and ensure the floor carpet does not impact clutch pedal operation.",
      "generated_response": "**Things to watch when using the clutch pedal**\n\n1. **Shifting**  \n   * Press the clutch pedal **fully down before** you move the gear lever.  \n   * When you release the clutch, do it **smoothly** and at the same time **lightly press the accelerator** to prevent the engine from stalling.  \n\n2. **Carpet / floor\u2011mat clearance**  \n   * Make sure the vehicle carpet (or floor mat) is the correct type for your model and is **securely fastened with its grommets**.  \n   * Verify that the carpet does **not interfere** with the clutch (or any other) pedal.  \n   * Never place objects (towels, keys, etc.) under the carpet, as they can shift and block pedal movement.  \n\n3. **Safety check**  \n   * After installing or re\u2011installing carpet, **fully depress the clutch pedal** (and the other pedals) to confirm there is no obstruction or abnormal resistance.  \n\nBy paying attention to proper clutch operation and ensuring the floor covering does not block or alter the pedal\u2019s movement, you\u2019ll avoid loss of control and keep the transmission running smoothly.",
      "retrieved_chunks": [
        " Shifting Fully press the clutch pedal before shifting gears.  As you release the clutch pedal, lightly press the accelerator pedal.  You should always use FIRST gear when starting from a standing position.  Note: A certain amount of noise from the transmission is normal.  This noise can be most noticeable when the vehicle is idling in NEUTRAL with the clutch engaged (clutch pedal released), but it may also be heard when driving.  The noise may also be more noticeable when the transmission is warm.  This noise is normal and is not an indication of a problem with your clutch or transmission.\n\n Before Climbing A Steep Hill As you approach a hill, consider its grade or steepness.  Determine if it is too steep.  Look to see what the traction is on the hill side trail.  Is the trail straight up and down?  What is on top and the other side?  Are there ruts, rocks, branches or other obstacles on the path?  Can you safely recover the vehicle if something goes wrong?  If everything looks good and you feel confident, shift the transmission into a lower gear with 4L engaged, and proceed with caution, maintaining your momentum as you climb the hill.\n\n Carpet Safety Information Always use carpet designed to fit your vehicle.  Only use carpet that does not interfere with the operation of the pedal assemblies.  Only operate the vehicle when the carpet is securely attached by the grommets so it cannot slip out of position and interfere with the pedal assemblies or impair safe operation of your vehicle in other ways.  WARNING: If operating the vehicle without carpet in place the floor may become hot, and there is a risk of burns.  An improperly attached, damaged, folded, or damaged grommets may cause your carpet to interfere with the accelerator, brake, or clutch pedals and cause a loss of vehicle control.  To prevent SERIOUS INJURY or DEATH: ALWAYS securely attach your carpet using the grommets.  ALWAYS make sure objects cannot fall or slide into the driver\u2019s side floor area when the vehicle is moving.  Objects can become trapped under accelerator, brake, or clutch pedals and could cause a loss of vehicle control.  NEVER place any objects under the carpet (e.g., towels, keys, etc.).  These objects could change the position of the carpet and may cause interference with the accelerator, brake, or clutch pedals.  ONLY install carpet designed to fit your vehicle.  NEVER install carpet that cannot be properly attached and secured to your vehicle.  If the carpet needs to be replaced, only use manufacturer approved carpet for the specific make, model, and year of your vehicle.  If the vehicle carpet has been removed and re-installed, always properly attach carpet to the floor and check that the floor mat fasteners are secure to the vehicle carpet.  Fully depress each pedal to check for interference with the accelerator, brake, or clutch pedals then re-install the floor mats."

If it detects a Passive Entry key fob inside the vehicle, the vehicle will unlock and alert the customer.  If Passive Entry is disabled using the Uconnect system, the key fob protection described in this section remains active/functional.  When a door is open and the interior lights are on, rotating the instrument panel dimmer control to the extreme bottom position will cause all the interior lights to turn off.  This allows the doors to stay open for extended periods of time without discharging the vehicle\u2019s battery.  Be sure the hood is fully latched before driving your vehicle.  If the hood is not fully latched, it could open when the vehicle is in motion and block your vision.  Failure to follow this warning could result in serious injury or death.  The doors have to be open and then closed in order for the vehicle to check for the presence of a key fob; the Key Left Vehicle feature will not activate until all of the doors are closed.

The key fob allows you to lock or unlock the doors and tailgate from distances up to approximately 66 ft (20 m).  The key fob does not need to be pointed at the vehicle to activate the system.  The key fob also contains a mechanical key.  When any of these situations occur, after all open doors are closed, the FOBIK-Safe search will be executed.  If it detects a Passive Entry key fob inside the vehicle, the vehicle will unlock and alert the customer.  If Passive Entry is disabled using the Uconnect system, the key fob protection described in this section remains active/functional.  The electrical components inside of the key fob may be damaged if the key fob is subjected to strong electrical shocks.  In order to ensure complete effectiveness of the electronic devices inside of the key fob, avoid exposing the key fob to direct sunlight.  Once a key fob is programmed to a vehicle, it cannot be repurposed and reprogrammed to another vehicle.  Only key fobs that are programmed to the vehicle electronics can be used to start and operate the vehicle.  Once a key fob is programmed to a vehicle, it cannot be programmed to any other vehicle.  The system uses a key fob, keyless push button ignition and a Radio Frequency (RF) receiver to prevent unauthorized vehicle operation.  Therefore, only key fobs that are programmed to the vehicle can be used to start and operate the vehicle.  The system cannot reprogram a key fob obtained from another vehicle.

To stop the window from going all the way down during the Auto-Down operation, pull up on the switch briefly.  WARNING: There is no anti-pinch protection when the window is almost closed.  Be sure to clear all objects from the window before closing.\n\n Power Door Locks \u2014 If Equipped The power door lock switch is located on each front door panel.  Push the switch forward to unlock the doors, and rearward to lock the doors.  WARNING: For personal security reasons and safety in a collision, lock the vehicle doors when you drive, as well as when you park and exit the vehicle.  When exiting the vehicle, always place the ignition in the OFF position and remove the key from the vehicle.  Unsupervised use of vehicle equipment may cause severe personal injuries and death.  Never leave children alone in a vehicle, or with access to an unlocked vehicle.  Allowing children to be in a vehicle unattended is dangerous for a number of reasons.  A child or others could be seriously or fatally injured.  Children should be warned not to touch the parking brake, brake pedal or the gear selector.  Do not leave the key fob in or near the vehicle or in a location accessible to children.  A child could operate power windows, other controls, or move the vehicle."
