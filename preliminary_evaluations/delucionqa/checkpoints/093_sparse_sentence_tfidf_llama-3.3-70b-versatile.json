If the vehicle carpet has been removed and re-installed, always properly attach carpet to the floor and check that the floor mat fasteners are secure to the vehicle carpet. Fully depress each pedal to check for interference with the accelerator, brake, or clutch pedals then re-install the floor mats.",
