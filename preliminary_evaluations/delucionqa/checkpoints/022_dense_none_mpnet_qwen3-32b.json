      "question": "When will the Automatic SOS be triggered?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "The Automatic SOS will be triggered in the event that your vehicle's airbags deploy.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking when the Automatic SOS will be triggered. I need to look through the provided context to find the answer.\n\nFirst, the context mentions \"Automatic SOS \u2014 If Equipped\" and describes it as a hands-free safety service that connects you with help if the vehicle's airbags deploy. So, the key trigger here is the airbags deploying. That's the main event that activates Automatic SOS.\n\nThen there's the SOS Call button on the overhead console. If someone pushes that button, it starts a 10-second delay before connecting to an operator. But the question is about Automatic SOS, not the manual SOS Call. The manual SOS is initiated by pressing the button, but Automatic SOS is automatic, so it's tied to the airbag deployment.\n\nI should make sure there's no other trigger mentioned. The context also talks about the SOS Call system transmitting vehicle info when the button is pressed, but Automatic SOS is specifically linked to airbag deployment. There's no mention of other triggers like a crash sensor or impact detection beyond airbags. So the answer should focus on airbag deployment as the trigger for Automatic SOS.\n</think>\n\nThe Automatic SOS will be triggered **when the vehicle\u2019s airbags deploy**. This hands-free safety service automatically connects the vehicle to an SOS operator in such an event. Additionally, the SOS Call can also be manually initiated by pressing the SOS Call button on the overhead console, but the Automatic SOS is specifically activated by airbag deployment.",

        " Automatic SOS \u2014 If Equipped Automatic SOS is a hands-free safety service that can immediately connect you with help in the event that your vehicle\u2019s airbags deploy.  Please refer to your provided radio supplement for complete information.\n\n SOS Call Push the SOS Call button on the overhead console.  Note: in case the sos call button is pushed in error, there will be a 10 second delay before the sos call system initiates a call to an sos operator.  To cancel the SOS Call connection, push the SOS call button on the overhead console or press the cancellation button on the Device Screen.  Termination of the SOS Call will turn off the green LED light on the overhead console.  The LED light located within the ASSIST and SOS buttons on the overhead console will turn green once a connection to an SOS operator has been made.  Once a connection between the vehicle and an sos operator is made, the sos call system may transmit the following important vehicle information to an sos operator: indication that the occupant placed an sos call.  The vehicle brand.  The last known GPS coordinates of the vehicle.  You should be able to speak with the SOS operator through the vehicle audio system to determine if additional help is needed.  Warning: always obey traffic laws and pay attention to the road.  ALWAYS drive safely with your hands on the steering wheel.  You have full responsibility and assume all risks related to the use of the features and applications in this vehicle.  Only use the features and applications when it is safe to do so.  Failure to do so may result in an accident involving serious injury or death.  Note: your vehicle may be transmitting data as authorized by the subscriber.  Once a connection is made between the vehicle\u2019s SOS Call system and the SOS operator, the SOS operator may be able to open a voice connection with the vehicle to determine if additional help is needed.  Once the SOS operator opens a voice connection with the vehicle\u2019s SOS Call system, the operator should be able to speak with the vehicle occupants, and hear sounds occurring in the vehicle.  The vehicle\u2019s SOS Call system will attempt to remain connected with the SOS operator until the SOS operator terminates the connection.  The SOS operator may attempt to contact appropriate emergency responders and provide them with important vehicle information and GPS coordinates.  WARNING: If anyone in the vehicle could be in danger (e.g., fire or smoke is visible, dangerous road conditions or location), do not wait for voice contact from an Emergency Services Agent.  All occupants should exit the vehicle immediately and move to a safe location.  Never place anything on or near the vehicle\u2019s operable network and GPS antennas.  You could prevent operable network and GPS signal reception, which can prevent your vehicle from placing an emergency call.  An operable network and GPS signal reception is required for the SOS Call system to function properly.  The SOS Call system is embedded into the vehicle\u2019s electrical system.  Do not add aftermarket electrical equipment to the vehicle\u2019s electrical system.  This may prevent your vehicle from sending a signal to initiate an emergency call.  To avoid interference that can cause the SOS Call system to fail, never add aftermarket equipment (e.g., two-way mobile radio, CB radio, data recorder, etc.)  to your vehicle\u2019s electrical system or modify the antennas on your vehicle.  IF YOUR VEHICLE LOSES BATTERY POWER FOR ANY REASON (INCLUDING DURING OR AFTER AN ACCIDENT), THE UCONNECT FEATURES, APPS AND SERVICES, AMONG OTHERS, WILL NOT OPERATE.  Modifications to any part of the SOS Call system could cause the air bag system to fail when you need it.  You could be injured if the air bag system is not there to help protect you.\n\n Connected Services SOS FAQs \u2014 If Equipped What happens if I accidentally push the SOS Call button on the mirror or overhead console?  You have 10 seconds after pushing the SOS Call button to cancel the call.  To cancel the call, either push the SOS Call button again, or press the Cancel button on the in-vehicle touchscreen.  What type of information is sent when I use the SOS Call button from my vehicle?  Certain vehicle information, such as make and model, is transmitted along with the last known GPS location.  When could I use the SOS Call button?  You can use the SOS Call button to make a call if you or someone else needs emergency assistance."

      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the provided context, here are the key things to pay attention to regarding the clutch pedal:\n\n1. Fully press the clutch pedal before shifting gears. Pressing the clutch pedal all the way down is necessary when changing gears to prevent damage to the transmission.\n\n2. As you release the clutch pedal, lightly press the accelerator pedal. This coordination of the clutch and accelerator is important for smooth gear shifts.\n\n3. Certain noise from the transmission may be noticeable when the clutch is engaged (pedal released). This noise is normal and not an indication of a problem with the clutch or transmission.\n\n4. Ensure the carpet is securely attached and does not interfere with the operation of the clutch pedal. Unattached or improperly placed carpet could get stuck under the clutch pedal and cause a loss of vehicle control.\n\nIn summary, focus on fully pressing and properly releasing the clutch pedal during gear shifts, be aware of normal transmission noises, and ensure the floor carpet does not impact clutch pedal operation.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking what they should pay attention to regarding the clutch pedal. I need to look through the provided context to find relevant information.\n\nFirst, in the \"Shifting Fully\" section, it says to press the clutch pedal before shifting gears and release it while pressing the accelerator. Also, when starting, use first gear. Then there's a note about transmission noise being normal when the clutch is engaged, like when idling in neutral. That might not be directly about the pedal but related.\n\nNext, the \"Before Climbing A Steep Hill\" part mentions shifting to a lower gear with 4L engaged. Not sure if that's about the clutch pedal specifically, but maybe about gear shifting in general.\n\nThe \"Carpet Safety Information\" is more detailed. It warns about the carpet interfering with pedals. Specifically, it says to ensure the carpet is securely attached with grommets so it doesn't slip and interfere with the pedals. Also, never place objects under the carpet that might affect pedal operation. The warning mentions that improper carpet could cause loss of control. Also, when reinstalling carpets, check for interference by fully depressing each pedal.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the main points about the clutch pedal are: pressing it fully when shifting, using first gear when starting, and ensuring the carpet doesn't interfere with it. The carpet safety part is crucial because if the carpet is not properly secured, it could get under the clutch pedal and cause issues. Also, checking for interference after reinstalling carpets by testing each pedal. The transmission noise note might be a distractor unless it's about clutch engagement, but the question is about the clutch pedal itself.\n\nSo the answer should focus on the clutch pedal operation during shifting and the safety aspects related to the carpet not interfering with it. Also, the warning about objects under the carpet affecting pedals. Need to mention secure attachment of carpets, no objects under them, and checking for pedal interference after installation.\n</think>\n\nWhen paying attention to the clutch pedal, ensure the following:  \n1. **Proper Operation**: Fully press the clutch pedal before shifting gears. When starting from a standing position, use **first gear**. As you release the clutch, lightly press the accelerator.  \n2. **Carpet Safety**:  \n   - Use **vehicle-specific carpets** securely attached with grommets to prevent slipping or interference with the clutch pedal.  \n   - **Never** place objects",

        " Shifting Fully press the clutch pedal before shifting gears.  As you release the clutch pedal, lightly press the accelerator pedal.  You should always use FIRST gear when starting from a standing position.  Note: A certain amount of noise from the transmission is normal.  This noise can be most noticeable when the vehicle is idling in NEUTRAL with the clutch engaged (clutch pedal released), but it may also be heard when driving.  The noise may also be more noticeable when the transmission is warm.  This noise is normal and is not an indication of a problem with your clutch or transmission.\n\n Before Climbing A Steep Hill As you approach a hill, consider its grade or steepness.  Determine if it is too steep.  Look to see what the traction is on the hill side trail.  Is the trail straight up and down?  What is on top and the other side?  Are there ruts, rocks, branches or other obstacles on the path?  Can you safely recover the vehicle if something goes wrong?  If everything looks good and you feel confident, shift the transmission into a lower gear with 4L engaged, and proceed with caution, maintaining your momentum as you climb the hill.\n\n Carpet Safety Information Always use carpet designed to fit your vehicle.  Only use carpet that does not interfere with the operation of the pedal assemblies.  Only operate the vehicle when the carpet is securely attached by the grommets so it cannot slip out of position and interfere with the pedal assemblies or impair safe operation of your vehicle in other ways.  WARNING: If operating the vehicle without carpet in place the floor may become hot, and there is a risk of burns.  An improperly attached, damaged, folded, or damaged grommets may cause your carpet to interfere with the accelerator, brake, or clutch pedals and cause a loss of vehicle control.  To prevent SERIOUS INJURY or DEATH: ALWAYS securely attach your carpet using the grommets.  ALWAYS make sure objects cannot fall or slide into the driver\u2019s side floor area when the vehicle is moving.  Objects can become trapped under accelerator, brake, or clutch pedals and could cause a loss of vehicle control.  NEVER place any objects under the carpet (e.g., towels, keys, etc.).  These objects could change the position of the carpet and may cause interference with the accelerator, brake, or clutch pedals.  ONLY install carpet designed to fit your vehicle.  NEVER install carpet that cannot be properly attached and secured to your vehicle.  If the carpet needs to be replaced, only use manufacturer approved carpet for the specific make, model, and year of your vehicle.  If the vehicle carpet has been removed and re-installed, always properly attach carpet to the floor and check that the floor mat fasteners are secure to the vehicle carpet.  Fully depress each pedal to check for interference with the accelerator, brake, or clutch pedals then re-install the floor mats."

      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the provided context, it seems that the ability to deactivate the Daytime Running Lights (DRLs) depends on the specific vehicle and the market it is sold in.\n\nFor vehicles sold in Canada, the context indicates that the headlight switch does not have an \"OFF\" detent. Instead, the headlights will be deactivated when the headlight switch is placed in the parking lights position. However, the DRLs will still be activated along with the front and rear marker lights in this scenario.\n\nThe context also mentions that the DRLs may be deactivated when the parking brake is engaged, and that for vehicles sold in Canada, the DRLs will automatically deactivate when the front fog lights are turned on.\n\nAdditionally, the context states that on some vehicles, the Daytime Running Lights may deactivate or reduce intensity on one side of the vehicle when a turn signal is activated on that side, or on both sides of the vehicle when the hazard warning lights are activated.\n\nHowever, the context does not explicitly state that the DRLs can be manually deactivated by the driver. The information provided suggests that the ability to deactivate the DRLs may be limited or controlled by the vehicle's design and features, rather than being a user-configurable option.\n\nTherefore, based on the given context, it is not clear if the DRLs can be deactivated by the driver. The ability to deactivate them may depend on the specific vehicle model and market regulations.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they can deactivate the DRLs. I need to check the context provided.\n\nLooking through the context, there's a lot of repetition about DRLs. It mentions that for Canadian vehicles, the DRLs automatically deactivate when front fog lights are on. Also, when the parking brake is engaged, DRLs may deactivate. Additionally, when turn signals or hazard lights are activated, DRLs might deactivate or reduce intensity. \n\nBut the question is about deactivating DRLs in general. The context says that the headlight switch in Canada has AUTO and ON but no OFF. When the switch is in the parking lights position, the headlights are off, but DRLs are activated. However, if the parking brake is engaged, DRLs might turn off. Also, there's a mention of BeltAlert being deactivatable by a dealer, but that's not related to DRLs. \n\nWait, the user is asking if they can deactivate DRLs. The context doesn't mention a manual way to turn them off. It only talks about automatic deactivation under certain conditions. So unless there's a specific switch or setting mentioned, the answer would be that DRLs can't be manually deactivated except under those specific scenarios. Also, the note about Canadian vehicles not having an OFF detent for the headlight switch implies that there's no standard way to turn off DRLs manually. \n\nSo the answer is that DRLs can't be deactivated manually except when certain conditions are met, like using fog lights, parking brake, or turn signals. The user can't just turn them off like regular headlights. The context doesn't mention any method for the user to manually deactivate DRLs beyond those automatic conditions.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: The Daytime Running Lights (DRLs) cannot be manually deactivated under normal conditions. They automatically deactivate in specific scenarios, such as when the front fog lights are turned on (for Canadian vehicles), when the parking brake is engaged, or when turn signals/hazard lights are activated. For Canadian vehicles, the headlight switch does not include an \"OFF\" position, and DRLs are tied to the vehicle's systems (e.g., transmission, parking brake). There is no standard user-accessible method to manually disable DRLs beyond these automatic conditions.",

I need to look through the provided context to find the relevant information.\n\nFirst, the context mentions that pushing the unlock button once unlocks the driver's door, and twice unlocks all doors. That seems straightforward. The note also says that all doors can be programmed to unlock on the first push through Uconnect Settings, but the default is probably once for driver's door, twice for all. \n\nI should make sure there's no other method mentioned. The context also talks about Passive Entry, but the question specifically asks about using the key fob. So the answer should focus on pressing the unlock button twice. Also, the mechanical key is an option but the question is about the key fob. \n\nNo other steps are needed. Just press the unlock button twice. The answer should be concise, stating that to unlock all doors, press the unlock button twice. Maybe mention that the first press unlocks the driver's door. But the user asked specifically for unlocking all doors, so the main point is pressing twice.\n</think>\n\nTo unlock all the doors using the key fob, push and release the **unlock button twice**. The first press unlocks the driver\u2019s door, and the second press unlocks all doors. The turn signals will flash, and the illuminated entry system will activate when the doors are unlocked.",

To lock all the doors, push the lock button once.  When the doors are unlocked, the turn signals will flash and the illuminated entry system will be activated.  When the doors are locked, the turn signals will flash and the horn will chirp.  Note: All doors can be programmed to unlock on the first push of the unlock button through Uconnect Settings The mechanical flip key can be used to lock or unlock the doors, tailgate, glove compartment, storage compartments (if equipped), and rear seatbacks.\n\n When any of these situations occur, after all open doors are closed, the FOBIK-Safe search will be executed.  If it detects a Passive Entry key fob inside the vehicle, the vehicle will unlock and alert the customer.  If Passive Entry is disabled using the Uconnect system, the key fob protection described in this section remains active/functional.  When a door is open and the interior lights are on, rotating the instrument panel dimmer control to the extreme bottom position will cause all the interior lights to turn off.  This allows the doors to stay open for extended periods of time without discharging the vehicle\u2019s battery.  Be sure the hood is fully latched before driving your vehicle.  If the hood is not fully latched, it could open when the vehicle is in motion and block your vision.  Failure to follow this warning could result in serious injury or death.  The doors have to be open and then closed in order for the vehicle to check for the presence of a key fob; the Key Left Vehicle feature will not activate until all of the doors are closed.

The key fob allows you to lock or unlock the doors and tailgate from distances up to approximately 66 ft (20 m).  The key fob does not need to be pointed at the vehicle to activate the system.  The key fob also contains a mechanical key.  When any of these situations occur, after all open doors are closed, the FOBIK-Safe search will be executed.  If it detects a Passive Entry key fob inside the vehicle, the vehicle will unlock and alert the customer.  If Passive Entry is disabled using the Uconnect system, the key fob protection described in this section remains active/functional.  The electrical components inside of the key fob may be damaged if the key fob is subjected to strong electrical shocks.  In order to ensure complete effectiveness of the electronic devices inside of the key fob, avoid exposing the key fob to direct sunlight.  Once a key fob is programmed to a vehicle, it cannot be repurposed and reprogrammed to another vehicle.  Only key fobs that are programmed to the vehicle electronics can be used to start and operate the vehicle.  Once a key fob is programmed to a vehicle, it cannot be programmed to any other vehicle.  The system uses a key fob, keyless push button ignition and a Radio Frequency (RF) receiver to prevent unauthorized vehicle operation.

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking what's special about power windows based on the provided context. First, I need to go through the context carefully.\n\nThe context starts by explaining that power windows allow window movement with a button push. The switches are on the instrument panel below climate controls. Then it mentions the Auto-Down feature for driver and front passenger doors. Pushing the switch down past the detent makes the window go down automatically. Also, there's a warning about children and safety, like not leaving them unattended. The switches stay active for 10 minutes after turning off the ignition, and opening a front door cancels that. There are rear window switches too.\n\nThe Auto-Down feature is highlighted again in a separate section. It explains how to use it and how to stop the window mid-way. The warning about no anti-pinch protection when almost closed is there. Then there's info about power door locks, but the question is about power windows specifically.\n\nSo, the key points about power windows here are the Auto-Down feature, the location of switches, safety warnings regarding children, and the 10-minute active period after ignition off. The special aspect would be the Auto-Down functionality, which allows automatic window movement when the switch is pushed past the detent.

        " The power windows feature allows for movement of the windows with the push of a button.  The power window switches are located on the instrument panel below the climate controls.  Push the switch downward to open the window and pull upward to close the window.  The driver door power window switch and the front passenger door power window switch have an Auto-Down feature.  Push the window switch down, past the detent, and release and the window will go down automatically.  Power Window Switches Never leave children unattended in a vehicle, and do not let children play with power windows.  Do not leave the key fob in or near the vehicle, or in a location accessible to children.  Occupants, particularly unattended children, can become entrapped by the windows while operating the power window switches.  Such entrapment may result in serious injury or death.  The power window switches will remain active for up to 10 minutes after the ignition is placed in the OFF position.  Opening either front door will cancel this feature.  There are window switches located on the rear of the center console for the rear passenger windows.\n\n Auto-Down Feature The driver door power window switch and the front passenger door power window switch have an Auto-Down feature.  Push the window switch down, past the detent, and release and the window will go down automatically.  To open the window part way, push the window switch down briefly, without going past the detent, and release it when you want the window to stop.  To stop the window from going all the way down during the Auto-Down operation, pull up on the switch briefly.  WARNING: There is no anti-pinch protection when the window is almost closed.  Be sure to clear all objects from the window before closing.\n\n Power Door Locks \u2014 If Equipped The power door lock switch is located on each front door panel.  Push the switch forward to unlock the doors, and rearward to lock the doors.  WARNING: For personal security reasons and safety in a collision, lock the vehicle doors when you drive, as well as when you park and exit the vehicle.  When exiting the vehicle, always place the ignition in the OFF position and remove the key from the vehicle.  Unsupervised use of vehicle equipment may cause severe personal injuries and death.  Never leave children alone in a vehicle, or with access to an unlocked vehicle.  Allowing children to be in a vehicle unattended is dangerous for a number of reasons.  A child or others could be seriously or fatally injured.  Children should be warned not to touch the parking brake, brake pedal or the gear selector.  Do not leave the key fob in or near the vehicle or in a location accessible to children.  A child could operate power windows, other controls, or move the vehicle."
