If it detects a Passive Entry key fob inside the vehicle, the vehicle will unlock and alert the customer. If Passive Entry is disabled using the Uconnect system, the key fob protection described in this section remains active/functional. The electrical components inside of the key fob may be damaged if the key fob is subjected to strong electrical shocks. In order to ensure complete effectiveness of the electronic devices inside of the key fob, avoid exposing the key fob to direct sunlight. Once a key fob is programmed to a vehicle, it cannot be repurposed and reprogrammed to another vehicle. Only key fobs that are programmed to the vehicle electronics can be used to start and operate the vehicle. Once a key fob is programmed to a vehicle, it cannot be programmed to any other vehicle. The system uses a key fob, keyless push button ignition and a Radio Frequency (RF) receiver to prevent unauthorized vehicle operation."
