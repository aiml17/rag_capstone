If the vehicle speed is above 20 mph (32 km/h) when you set the cruise control, the set speed will be the current vehicle speed.\n\nSo in summary, the instructions clearly state that you can adjust the desired speed by using the SET (+) and SET (-) buttons while the Cruise Control is active.",

However, it does not provide clear instructions on how to change the speed after it has been set. \n\nIn general cruise control systems, you can typically increase or decrease the set speed by using the SET (+) or SET (-) buttons, or by pressing the accelerator or brake pedals, then re-setting the speed.
