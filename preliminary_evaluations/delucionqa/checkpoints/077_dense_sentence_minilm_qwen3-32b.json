I need to look through the provided context to find the relevant information.\n\nFirst, I remember the context mentions \"Automatic SOS \u2014 If Equipped\" as a hands-free safety service. The key part here is that it connects you with help when the vehicle's airbags deploy. The context says, \"in the event that your vehicle\u2019s airbags deploy.\" So that seems like the trigger condition.\n\nLet me double-check to make sure there aren't other triggers mentioned. The rest of the context talks about manually pushing the SOS Call button, but the Automatic SOS specifically is tied to airbag deployment. There's no mention of other events triggering it, like a collision sensor or impact. Just airbags deploying.\n\nAlso, there's a note about the 10-second delay when the SOS button is pushed accidentally, but that's for the manual SOS Call, not the automatic one. The Automatic SOS is separate and only activates when airbags deploy. So the answer should be that Automatic SOS is triggered when the airbags deploy.\n</think>\n\nThe Automatic SOS will be triggered **when the vehicle\u2019s airbags deploy**.

      "question": "Can I deactivate the DRLs?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the provided context, it seems that the ability to deactivate the Daytime Running Lights (DRLs) depends on the specific vehicle and the market it is sold in.\n\nFor vehicles sold in Canada, the context indicates that the headlight switch does not have an \"OFF\" detent. Instead, the headlights will be deactivated when the headlight switch is placed in the parking lights position. However, the DRLs will still be activated along with the front and rear marker lights in this scenario.\n\nThe context also mentions that the DRLs may be deactivated when the parking brake is engaged, and that for vehicles sold in Canada, the DRLs will automatically deactivate when the front fog lights are turned on.\n\nAdditionally, the context states that on some vehicles, the Daytime Running Lights may deactivate or reduce intensity on one side of the vehicle when a turn signal is activated on that side, or on both sides of the vehicle when the hazard warning lights are activated.\n\nHowever, the context does not explicitly state that the DRLs can be manually deactivated by the driver. The information provided suggests that the ability to deactivate the DRLs may be limited or controlled by the vehicle's design and features, rather than being a user-configurable option.\n\nTherefore, based on the given context, it is not clear if the DRLs can be deactivated by the driver. The ability to deactivate them may depend on the specific vehicle model and market regulations.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they can deactivate the DRLs. I need to check the context provided.\n\nLooking through the context, there's a lot of repetition about DRLs. The key points are about when DRLs are active and some conditions where they deactivate, like when using turn signals or hazard lights. Also mentioned is that vehicles in Canada have a headlight switch without an OFF detent. \n\nWait, there's a part that says \"The DRLs may be deactivated when the parking brake is engaged.\" So engaging the parking brake might turn them off. Also, when the front fog lights are on in Canada, DRLs deactivate. But the user is asking if they can deactivate DRLs themselves. \n\nBut the context doesn't mention a user-accessible switch or method to turn off DRLs. It says that BeltAlert can be activated/deactivated by an authorized dealer, but nothing about DRLs. The DRLs seem to be controlled by the vehicle's systems based on certain conditions. The headlight switch in Canada has AUTO and ON but no OFF, so maybe in AUTO mode, DRLs are active. If you switch to ON, maybe the headlights are on instead of DRLs? But the context says when the headlight switch is in parking lights position, the DRLs are activated. \n\nSo, unless there's a specific switch or setting mentioned, it seems like the DRLs can't be manually deactivated by the user. The only times they deactivate are under specific conditions like parking brake, fog lights, or when low beams are on. Therefore, the answer would be that you can't deactivate them manually, only through those conditions. Unless there's something about the dealer, but the context only mentions BeltAlert being dealer-deactivatable, not DRLs. So the answer is no, you can't deactivate DRLs yourself; they only turn off under certain circumstances.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: DRLs cannot be manually deactivated by the user under normal conditions. They automatically deactivate in specific scenarios, such as when the parking brake is engaged, front fog lights are turned on (in Canada), or when turn signals/hazard lights are activated. Vehicles sold in Canada have a headlight switch without an \"OFF\" position, but there is no user-accessible method to permanently disable DRLs.
