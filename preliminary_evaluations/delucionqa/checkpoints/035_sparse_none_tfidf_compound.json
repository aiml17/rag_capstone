        " Automatic SOS \u2014 If Equipped Automatic SOS is a hands-free safety service that can immediately connect you with help in the event that your vehicle\u2019s airbags deploy.  Please refer to your provided radio supplement for complete information.\n\n SOS Call Push the SOS Call button on the overhead console.  Note: in case the sos call button is pushed in error, there will be a 10 second delay before the sos call system initiates a call to an sos operator.  To cancel the SOS Call connection, push the SOS call button on the overhead console or press the cancellation button on the Device Screen.  Termination of the SOS Call will turn off the green LED light on the overhead console.  The LED light located within the ASSIST and SOS buttons on the overhead console will turn green once a connection to an SOS operator has been made.  Once a connection between the vehicle and an sos operator is made, the sos call system may transmit the following important vehicle information to an sos operator: indication that the occupant placed an sos call.  The vehicle brand.  The last known GPS coordinates of the vehicle.  You should be able to speak with the SOS operator through the vehicle audio system to determine if additional help is needed.  Warning: always obey traffic laws and pay attention to the road.  ALWAYS drive safely with your hands on the steering wheel.  You have full responsibility and assume all risks related to the use of the features and applications in this vehicle.  Only use the features and applications when it is safe to do so.  Failure to do so may result in an accident involving serious injury or death.  Note: your vehicle may be transmitting data as authorized by the subscriber.  Once a connection is made between the vehicle\u2019s SOS Call system and the SOS operator, the SOS operator may be able to open a voice connection with the vehicle to determine if additional help is needed.  Once the SOS operator opens a voice connection with the vehicle\u2019s SOS Call system, the operator should be able to speak with the vehicle occupants, and hear sounds occurring in the vehicle.  The vehicle\u2019s SOS Call system will attempt to remain connected with the SOS operator until the SOS operator terminates the connection.  The SOS operator may attempt to contact appropriate emergency responders and provide them with important vehicle information and GPS coordinates.  WARNING: If anyone in the vehicle could be in danger (e.g., fire or smoke is visible, dangerous road conditions or location), do not wait for voice contact from an Emergency Services Agent.  All occupants should exit the vehicle immediately and move to a safe location.  Never place anything on or near the vehicle\u2019s operable network and GPS antennas.  You could prevent operable network and GPS signal reception, which can prevent your vehicle from placing an emergency call.  An operable network and GPS signal reception is required for the SOS Call system to function properly.  The SOS Call system is embedded into the vehicle\u2019s electrical system.  Do not add aftermarket electrical equipment to the vehicle\u2019s electrical system.  This may prevent your vehicle from sending a signal to initiate an emergency call.  To avoid interference that can cause the SOS Call system to fail, never add aftermarket equipment (e.g., two-way mobile radio, CB radio, data recorder, etc.)  to your vehicle\u2019s electrical system or modify the antennas on your vehicle.  IF YOUR VEHICLE LOSES BATTERY POWER FOR ANY REASON (INCLUDING DURING OR AFTER AN ACCIDENT), THE UCONNECT FEATURES, APPS AND SERVICES, AMONG OTHERS, WILL NOT OPERATE.  Modifications to any part of the SOS Call system could cause the air bag system to fail when you need it.  You could be injured if the air bag system is not there to help protect you.\n\n Connected Services SOS FAQs \u2014 If Equipped What happens if I accidentally push the SOS Call button on the mirror or overhead console?  You have 10 seconds after pushing the SOS Call button to cancel the call.  To cancel the call, either push the SOS Call button again, or press the Cancel button on the in-vehicle touchscreen.  What type of information is sent when I use the SOS Call button from my vehicle?  Certain vehicle information, such as make and model, is transmitted along with the last known GPS location.  When could I use the SOS Call button?  You can use the SOS Call button to make a call if you or someone else needs emergency assistance."

Prepare Both Vehicles (or the booster pack)\n\n| Action | Why it matters |\n|--------|----------------|\n| **Apply the parking brake** on your car (and on the donor vehicle if you\u2019re using one). | Prevents the cars from moving while you\u2019re working. |\n| **Shift the transmission** \u2013 automatic to **PARK (P)**, manual to **NEUTRAL**. | Guarantees the vehicle cannot roll. |\n| **Turn the ignition to OFF** on both vehicles. | Keeps the electrical system off while you make connections. |\n| **Turn off all accessories** (heater, radio, lights, etc.). | Reduces the load on the dead battery and prevents sparks. |\n| **Park the donor vehicle** (or place the booster pack) so the jumper\u2011cable ends can reach the battery posts, but **do not let the vehicles touch**. | Prevents an unintended ground connection that could cause injury. |\n| **Remove metal jewelry** (rings, bracelets, watches). | Avoids accidental electrical contact. |\n| **Keep flames, sparks, and the radiator cooling fan away** from the open hood. | Battery gases are flammable; the fan can start unexpectedly. |\n\n---\n\n### 2. Locate and Access the Battery\n\n* The main battery is **in the right\u2011rear of the engine compartment**.  \n* If the vehicle has a **Stop/Start system**, it will have **two batteries** \u2013 **only use the positive post on the main battery** for jump\u2011starting.  \n* The **positive (+) post** is covered with a protective cap; **lift the cap** to expose the post.  \n\n> **Important:** Never attempt to jump\u2011start from the supplemental battery; doing so can cause serious injury or death.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Verify the Booster Source\n\n* Use **jumper cables** and a **donor vehicle** with a healthy 12\u2011V battery **or** a **portable battery booster pack** that is **rated \u2264\u202f12\u202fV**.  \n* **Do not use a \u201cfast charger\u201d** or any booster source with a voltage higher than 12\u202fV for starting.  \n* Ensure the **cable clamps are not touching each other** at any time.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Connect the Jumper Cables (order matters)\n\n1. **Red clamp (positive)** to the **positive (+) post** of the **dead battery**.  \n2. **Red clamp (positive)** to the **positive (+) post** of the **good battery** (or booster pack).  \n3. **Black clamp (negative)** to a **clean, unpainted metal surface** on the **engine block or chassis** of the **dead\u2011vehicle** (away from the battery).  \n4. **Black clamp (negative)** to the **negative (\u2013) terminal** of the **good battery** (or booster pack).  \n\n*Keep the unused ends of the cables away from each other and from any vehicle parts while you\u2019re making the connections.*\n\n---\n\n### 5. Start the Donor Vehicle (or turn on the booster pack)\n\n* Let it run for a few minutes to allow the dead battery to receive charge.  \n* If using a booster pack, follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for \u201con\u201d mode.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Attempt to Start the Disabled Vehicle\n\n* Try to start the engine.  \n* If it doesn\u2019t start after a few attempts, wait a few more minutes while the donor vehicle continues to run, then try again.  \n\n**Do not crank the engine for more than a few seconds at a time**; this can overheat the starter.\n\n---\n\n### 7. Disconnect the Cables (reverse order)\n\n1. Remove the **black clamp** from the **donor vehicle\u2019s negative terminal**.  \n2. Remove the **black clamp** from the **engine block/chassis** of the dead vehicle.  \n3. Remove the **red clamp** from the **donor vehicle\u2019s positive terminal**.  \n4. Remove the **red clamp** from the **dead vehicle\u2019s positive terminal**.  \n\n*Again, keep the free ends from touching each other or any metal.*\n\n---\n\n### 8. After\u2011Start Actions\n\n* Keep the revived vehicle running for at least **15\u201320 minutes** (or drive it) to let the alternator recharge the battery.  \n* **Wash your hands** after handling the battery, as battery posts and terminals contain lead compounds.  \n* If the battery was frozen, **do not attempt a jump\u2011start** \u2013 have it inspected/replaced.  \n\n---\n\n### 9. Safety Recap (Key Warnings)\n\n* **Only use the main battery\u2019s positive post** \u2013 never the supplemental battery.  \n* **Do not use a booster >\u202f12\u202fV**; it can damage the vehicle\u2019s electrical system.  \n* **Never let cable clamps touch each other** while connected.  \n* **Keep sparks/flames away** \u2013 battery gases are flammable and explosive.  \n* **Do not let the vehicles touch** \u2013 could create a dangerous ground path.  \n* **Avoid the cooling fan** when the hood is open \u2013 it can spin on its own.  \n\nFollowing these steps exactly will let you safely jump\u2011start the car while minimizing the risk of injury, battery damage, or vehicle damage.",

      "question": "What should I pay attention to for the clutch pedal?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the provided context, here are the key things to pay attention to regarding the clutch pedal:\n\n1. Fully press the clutch pedal before shifting gears. Pressing the clutch pedal all the way down is necessary when changing gears to prevent damage to the transmission.\n\n2. As you release the clutch pedal, lightly press the accelerator pedal. This coordination of the clutch and accelerator is important for smooth gear shifts.\n\n3. Certain noise from the transmission may be noticeable when the clutch is engaged (pedal released). This noise is normal and not an indication of a problem with the clutch or transmission.\n\n4. Ensure the carpet is securely attached and does not interfere with the operation of the clutch pedal. Unattached or improperly placed carpet could get stuck under the clutch pedal and cause a loss of vehicle control.\n\nIn summary, focus on fully pressing and properly releasing the clutch pedal during gear shifts, be aware of normal transmission noises, and ensure the floor carpet does not impact clutch pedal operation.",
      "generated_response": "When using the clutch pedal, keep these points in mind:\n\n1. **Full Depression Before Shifting** \u2013 Always press the clutch pedal all the way down before you move the gear lever. This fully disengages the transmission and protects the clutch.\n\n2. **Smooth Release with Light Throttle** \u2013 As you let the clutch pedal come back up, gently press the accelerator. This helps the clutch re\u2011engage smoothly and prevents stalling.\n\n3. **No Interference from Floor Coverings** \u2013  \n   * Use only carpet that is designed for your vehicle and is securely fastened with its grommets.  \n   * Verify that the carpet (or any floor mat) does not touch or block the clutch, brake, or accelerator pedals.  \n   * Remove any loose objects (keys, towels, etc.) that could get caught under the carpet and interfere with pedal travel.\n\n4. **Check Pedal Clearance After Installing/Repairing Carpet** \u2013 After reinstalling the carpet, fully depress each pedal (clutch, brake, accelerator) to make sure nothing is obstructing its movement.\n\n5. **Listen for Normal Transmission Noise** \u2013 A slight whine when the clutch is released in neutral is normal and not a clutch problem, but if the noise changes dramatically, have it inspected.\n\nBy following these practices you\u2019ll ensure the clutch operates correctly and avoid accidental pedal interference that could lead to loss of control.",
      "retrieved_chunks": [
        " Shifting Fully press the clutch pedal before shifting gears.  As you release the clutch pedal, lightly press the accelerator pedal.  You should always use FIRST gear when starting from a standing position.  Note: A certain amount of noise from the transmission is normal.  This noise can be most noticeable when the vehicle is idling in NEUTRAL with the clutch engaged (clutch pedal released), but it may also be heard when driving.  The noise may also be more noticeable when the transmission is warm.  This noise is normal and is not an indication of a problem with your clutch or transmission.\n\n Before Climbing A Steep Hill As you approach a hill, consider its grade or steepness.  Determine if it is too steep.  Look to see what the traction is on the hill side trail.  Is the trail straight up and down?  What is on top and the other side?  Are there ruts, rocks, branches or other obstacles on the path?  Can you safely recover the vehicle if something goes wrong?  If everything looks good and you feel confident, shift the transmission into a lower gear with 4L engaged, and proceed with caution, maintaining your momentum as you climb the hill.\n\n Carpet Safety Information Always use carpet designed to fit your vehicle.  Only use carpet that does not interfere with the operation of the pedal assemblies.  Only operate the vehicle when the carpet is securely attached by the grommets so it cannot slip out of position and interfere with the pedal assemblies or impair safe operation of your vehicle in other ways.  WARNING: If operating the vehicle without carpet in place the floor may become hot, and there is a risk of burns.  An improperly attached, damaged, folded, or damaged grommets may cause your carpet to interfere with the accelerator, brake, or clutch pedals and cause a loss of vehicle control.  To prevent SERIOUS INJURY or DEATH: ALWAYS securely attach your carpet using the grommets.  ALWAYS make sure objects cannot fall or slide into the driver\u2019s side floor area when the vehicle is moving.  Objects can become trapped under accelerator, brake, or clutch pedals and could cause a loss of vehicle control.  NEVER place any objects under the carpet (e.g., towels, keys, etc.).  These objects could change the position of the carpet and may cause interference with the accelerator, brake, or clutch pedals.  ONLY install carpet designed to fit your vehicle.  NEVER install carpet that cannot be properly attached and secured to your vehicle.  If the carpet needs to be replaced, only use manufacturer approved carpet for the specific make, model, and year of your vehicle.  If the vehicle carpet has been removed and re-installed, always properly attach carpet to the floor and check that the floor mat fasteners are secure to the vehicle carpet.  Fully depress each pedal to check for interference with the accelerator, brake, or clutch pedals then re-install the floor mats."

        " To Lock/Unlock The Doors And Tailgate Push and release the unlock button on the key fob once to unlock the driver\u2019s door, or twice to unlock all the doors.  To lock all the doors, push the lock button once.  When the doors are unlocked, the turn signals will flash and the illuminated entry system will be activated.  When the doors are locked, the turn signals will flash and the horn will chirp.  Note: All doors can be programmed to unlock on the first push of the unlock button through Uconnect Settings The mechanical flip key can be used to lock or unlock the doors, tailgate, glove compartment, storage compartments (if equipped), and rear seatbacks.\n\n When any of these situations occur, after all open doors are closed, the FOBIK-Safe search will be executed.  If it detects a Passive Entry key fob inside the vehicle, the vehicle will unlock and alert the customer.  If Passive Entry is disabled using the Uconnect system, the key fob protection described in this section remains active/functional.  When a door is open and the interior lights are on, rotating the instrument panel dimmer control to the extreme bottom position will cause all the interior lights to turn off.  This allows the doors to stay open for extended periods of time without discharging the vehicle\u2019s battery.  Be sure the hood is fully latched before driving your vehicle.  If the hood is not fully latched, it could open when the vehicle is in motion and block your vision.  Failure to follow this warning could result in serious injury or death.  The doors have to be open and then closed in order for the vehicle to check for the presence of a key fob; the Key Left Vehicle feature will not activate until all of the doors are closed.  These alerts will not be activated in situations where the vehicle\u2019s engine is left running with the key fob inside.\n\n Your vehicle is equipped with a key fob which supports Passive Entry, Remote Keyless Entry (RKE), Keyless Enter \u2018n Go\u2122 (if equipped), and Remote Start (if equipped).  The key fob allows you to lock or unlock the doors and tailgate from distances up to approximately 66 ft (20 m).  The key fob does not need to be pointed at the vehicle to activate the system.  The key fob also contains a mechanical key.  When any of these situations occur, after all open doors are closed, the FOBIK-Safe search will be executed.  If it detects a Passive Entry key fob inside the vehicle, the vehicle will unlock and alert the customer.  If Passive Entry is disabled using the Uconnect system, the key fob protection described in this section remains active/functional.  The electrical components inside of the key fob may be damaged if the key fob is subjected to strong electrical shocks.  In order to ensure complete effectiveness of the electronic devices inside of the key fob, avoid exposing the key fob to direct sunlight.  Once a key fob is programmed to a vehicle, it cannot be repurposed and reprogrammed to another vehicle.  Only key fobs that are programmed to the vehicle electronics can be used to start and operate the vehicle.  Once a key fob is programmed to a vehicle, it cannot be programmed to any other vehicle.  The system uses a key fob, keyless push button ignition and a Radio Frequency (RF) receiver to prevent unauthorized vehicle operation.  Therefore, only key fobs that are programmed to the vehicle can be used to start and operate the vehicle.  The system cannot reprogram a key fob obtained from another vehicle.
