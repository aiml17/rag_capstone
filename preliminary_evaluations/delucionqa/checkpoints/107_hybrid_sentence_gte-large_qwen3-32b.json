      "question": "When will the Automatic SOS be triggered?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "The Automatic SOS will be triggered in the event that your vehicle's airbags deploy.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking when the Automatic SOS will be triggered. I need to look through the provided context to find the answer.\n\nFirst, the context mentions \"Automatic SOS \u2014 If Equipped\" as a hands-free safety service that connects you with help if the vehicle\u2019s airbags deploy. So, the main trigger here is the airbags deploying. That's probably the primary condition for the Automatic SOS to activate automatically without any user input.\n\nThen there's also the SOS Call button on the overhead console. If someone manually presses that button, it initiates an SOS call. But there's a note about an accidental press: a 10-second delay before the call goes through, and you can cancel it by pressing the button again or using the cancellation button on the device screen. However, the question is about when it's triggered, not about canceling. So pressing the SOS button manually would trigger it too.\n\nBut the question specifically says \"Automatic SOS,\" which might refer to the automatic triggering part. The manual SOS call is a separate feature, even though it's part of the same system. The key part here is \"Automatic SOS is a hands-free safety service that can immediately connect you with help in the event that your vehicle\u2019s airbags deploy.\" So the automatic trigger is airbag deployment. The manual trigger is pressing the SOS button, but that's not part of the \"Automatic\" feature.\n\nTherefore, the answer should focus on the airbags deploying as the trigger for the Automatic SOS. The user might be confused if they include the manual button press, but since the question is about the automatic aspect, it's only the airbag deployment.\n</think>\n\nThe Automatic SOS will be triggered **when the vehicle\u2019s airbags deploy**. This hands-free safety service automatically connects the vehicle to an SOS operator in such an event. Additionally, the SOS Call can also be manually initiated by pressing the SOS Call button on the overhead console, though this is a separate action from the automatic trigger.",

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they can deactivate the DRLs. I need to check the context provided.\n\nLooking through the context, there's a mention that DRLs may be deactivated when the parking brake is engaged. Also, for Canadian vehicles, they automatically turn off when front fog lights are on. Additionally, when turn signals or hazard lights are active, the DRLs on one or both sides might deactivate or dim. But the key part here is whether the user can manually deactivate them. \n\nThe context says \"DRLs may be deactivated when the parking brake is engaged,\" which implies that engaging the parking brake deactivates them, but that's an automatic action, not a manual deactivation by the user. There's also a part about BeltAlert being activatable or deactivatable by an authorized dealer, but that's a different system. The DRLs themselves don't mention user deactivation except in specific conditions like parking brake or fog lights. \n\nSo, based on the info, the answer would be that DRLs can't be manually deactivated by the user except under those specific conditions. The user can't just turn them off; they deactivate automatically in certain situations. The answer should reflect that.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: The Daytime Running Lights (DRLs) cannot be manually deactivated by the driver under normal conditions. However, they may automatically deactivate in specific scenarios, such as when the parking brake is engaged, the front fog lights are turned on (for vehicles sold in Canada), or when turn signals/hazard warning lights are activated.

The switches are on the instrument panel below climate controls. Then there's the Auto-Down feature for the driver and front passenger doors. Pushing the switch down past a detent makes the window go down automatically. Also, there's a note about safety\u2014no leaving kids unattended because they might get trapped. The switches stay active for 10 minutes after turning off the ignition, and opening a front door cancels that. Rear windows have switches on the center console. To stop Auto-Down, you pull up briefly. No anti-pinch protection when almost closed. Also, power door locks are mentioned but that's a separate feature.\n\nSo the main special features here are the Auto-Down function and the 10-minute active period after ignition off. Also, the location of the switches and the safety warnings. But the question is asking what's special, so probably focusing on the Auto-Down and the 10-minute active period. The answer should highlight these points. Let me check again to make sure I didn't miss anything. The Auto-Down is a key feature, and the fact that they remain active after turning off the engine. Also, the warning about children is important but maybe not part of the \"special\" features, more of a safety note. So the answer should mention the Auto-Down feature and the 10-minute active period. Maybe also the rear window switches, but the main special thing is the Auto-Down. Let me structure that.\n</think>\n\nThe power windows are special because they include an **Auto-Down feature** on the driver and front passenger door switches. Pushing the switch down past a detent allows the window to descend automatically without holding the switch. Additionally, the power window switches remain active for up to **10 minutes after the ignition is turned off**, and this feature is canceled by opening either front door. Safety warnings emphasize preventing child entrapment and the lack of anti-pinch protection when windows are nearly closed.",
