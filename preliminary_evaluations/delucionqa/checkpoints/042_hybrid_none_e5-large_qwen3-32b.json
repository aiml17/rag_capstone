      "question": "When will the Automatic SOS be triggered?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "The Automatic SOS will be triggered in the event that your vehicle's airbags deploy.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking when the Automatic SOS will be triggered. I need to look through the provided context to find the answer.\n\nFirst, the context mentions \"Automatic SOS \u2014 If Equipped\" and says it's a hands-free safety service that connects you with help if the vehicle's airbags deploy. So, the key point here is the deployment of airbags. That seems to be the trigger for the Automatic SOS. \n\nThen, there's also information about the SOS Call button. If someone pushes the SOS Call button on the overhead console, that manually triggers the SOS call. But the question specifically asks about Automatic SOS, which is different from manually pressing the button. \n\nThe context also explains that Automatic SOS is triggered when airbags deploy. The manual SOS call is when you press the button. The user is asking about the automatic one, so the answer should focus on airbag deployment. \n\nI need to make sure there's no other trigger mentioned. The rest of the document talks about what happens after the SOS is triggered, like the 10-second delay for accidental button presses, but that's for the manual SOS. The automatic one is only when airbags deploy. \n\nSo the answer should state that Automatic SOS is triggered when the vehicle's airbags deploy. That's the only condition mentioned in the context for the automatic activation.\n</think>\n\nThe Automatic SOS will be triggered when the vehicle\u2019s airbags deploy. This hands-free safety service automatically connects the vehicle to an SOS operator in such an event. Additionally, the SOS Call can also be manually initiated by pressing the SOS Call button on the overhead console, though this is separate from the automatic activation.",

        " Automatic SOS \u2014 If Equipped Automatic SOS is a hands-free safety service that can immediately connect you with help in the event that your vehicle\u2019s airbags deploy.  Please refer to your provided radio supplement for complete information.\n\n SOS Call Push the SOS Call button on the overhead console.  Note: in case the sos call button is pushed in error, there will be a 10 second delay before the sos call system initiates a call to an sos operator.  To cancel the SOS Call connection, push the SOS call button on the overhead console or press the cancellation button on the Device Screen.  Termination of the SOS Call will turn off the green LED light on the overhead console.  The LED light located within the ASSIST and SOS buttons on the overhead console will turn green once a connection to an SOS operator has been made.  Once a connection between the vehicle and an sos operator is made, the sos call system may transmit the following important vehicle information to an sos operator: indication that the occupant placed an sos call.  The vehicle brand.  The last known GPS coordinates of the vehicle.  You should be able to speak with the SOS operator through the vehicle audio system to determine if additional help is needed.  Warning: always obey traffic laws and pay attention to the road.  ALWAYS drive safely with your hands on the steering wheel.  You have full responsibility and assume all risks related to the use of the features and applications in this vehicle.  Only use the features and applications when it is safe to do so.  Failure to do so may result in an accident involving serious injury or death.  Note: your vehicle may be transmitting data as authorized by the subscriber.  Once a connection is made between the vehicle\u2019s SOS Call system and the SOS operator, the SOS operator may be able to open a voice connection with the vehicle to determine if additional help is needed.  Once the SOS operator opens a voice connection with the vehicle\u2019s SOS Call system, the operator should be able to speak with the vehicle occupants, and hear sounds occurring in the vehicle.  The vehicle\u2019s SOS Call system will attempt to remain connected with the SOS operator until the SOS operator terminates the connection.  The SOS operator may attempt to contact appropriate emergency responders and provide them with important vehicle information and GPS coordinates.  WARNING: If anyone in the vehicle could be in danger (e.g., fire or smoke is visible, dangerous road conditions or location), do not wait for voice contact from an Emergency Services Agent.  All occupants should exit the vehicle immediately and move to a safe location.  Never place anything on or near the vehicle\u2019s operable network and GPS antennas.  You could prevent operable network and GPS signal reception, which can prevent your vehicle from placing an emergency call.  An operable network and GPS signal reception is required for the SOS Call system to function properly.  The SOS Call system is embedded into the vehicle\u2019s electrical system.  Do not add aftermarket electrical equipment to the vehicle\u2019s electrical system.  This may prevent your vehicle from sending a signal to initiate an emergency call.  To avoid interference that can cause the SOS Call system to fail, never add aftermarket equipment (e.g., two-way mobile radio, CB radio, data recorder, etc.)  to your vehicle\u2019s electrical system or modify the antennas on your vehicle.  IF YOUR VEHICLE LOSES BATTERY POWER FOR ANY REASON (INCLUDING DURING OR AFTER AN ACCIDENT), THE UCONNECT FEATURES, APPS AND SERVICES, AMONG OTHERS, WILL NOT OPERATE.  Modifications to any part of the SOS Call system could cause the air bag system to fail when you need it.  You could be injured if the air bag system is not there to help protect you.\n\n Connected Services SOS FAQs \u2014 If Equipped What happens if I accidentally push the SOS Call button on the mirror or overhead console?  You have 10 seconds after pushing the SOS Call button to cancel the call.  To cancel the call, either push the SOS Call button again, or press the Cancel button on the in-vehicle touchscreen.  What type of information is sent when I use the SOS Call button from my vehicle?  Certain vehicle information, such as make and model, is transmitted along with the last known GPS location.  When could I use the SOS Call button?  You can use the SOS Call button to make a call if you or someone else needs emergency assistance."

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking how to jump start their car. The context provided is a detailed manual from the vehicle's owner's guide. I need to extract the key steps from that context and present them in a clear, concise answer.\n\nFirst, I'll start by identifying the main preparation steps. The context mentions applying the parking brake, shifting to park or neutral, turning off the ignition, and turning off all electrical accessories. That's important for safety and to prevent damage.\n\nThen, there's the part about using another vehicle or a portable booster. The user needs to park the vehicles close enough for the cables, apply the parking brake on the assisting vehicle, and ensure the ignition is off. Also, the warning about using only the main battery's positive post is crucial to avoid injury.\n\nNext, the actual procedure steps. The context lists connecting the jumper cables in a specific order: red to dead battery's positive, red to good battery's positive, black to good battery's negative, and the other black to an unpainted metal part on the dead car. Then starting the good car, letting it charge, and then starting the dead car. After that, disconnecting in reverse order.\n\nI should also include the warnings: not to let vehicles touch, avoid sparks near the battery, remove metal jewelry, and not to use a booster over 12V. Also, the note about not using a fast charger for starting.\n\nWait, the context repeats some parts, so I need to make sure I don't duplicate information. The answer should be step-by-step but not too lengthy. Let me structure it logically: preparation steps, connecting the cables, starting the cars, disconnecting, and safety warnings. Make sure to mention the Stop/Start system having two batteries and using only the main one. Also, the protective cap on the positive post needs to be lifted.\n\nI should check if all the critical points are covered. The user might not know about the two batteries if their car has a Stop/Start system, so that's important. Also, the order of connecting the cables is vital to prevent sparks. The warnings about hydrogen gas and sulfuric acid are there for safety. Need to mention those briefly.\n\nPutting it all together, the answer should guide the user through each step safely, emphasizing the order and precautions. Avoid technical jargon but be precise. Make sure the answer is easy to follow and covers all necessary safety measures.\n</think>\n\nTo",

      "question": "What should I pay attention to for the clutch pedal?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the provided context, here are the key things to pay attention to regarding the clutch pedal:\n\n1. Fully press the clutch pedal before shifting gears. Pressing the clutch pedal all the way down is necessary when changing gears to prevent damage to the transmission.\n\n2. As you release the clutch pedal, lightly press the accelerator pedal. This coordination of the clutch and accelerator is important for smooth gear shifts.\n\n3. Certain noise from the transmission may be noticeable when the clutch is engaged (pedal released). This noise is normal and not an indication of a problem with the clutch or transmission.\n\n4. Ensure the carpet is securely attached and does not interfere with the operation of the clutch pedal. Unattached or improperly placed carpet could get stuck under the clutch pedal and cause a loss of vehicle control.\n\nIn summary, focus on fully pressing and properly releasing the clutch pedal during gear shifts, be aware of normal transmission noises, and ensure the floor carpet does not impact clutch pedal operation.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking what they should pay attention to regarding the clutch pedal. I need to look through the provided context to find relevant information.\n\nFirst, the context starts with shifting gears. It says to fully press the clutch pedal before shifting and to release it while pressing the accelerator. That's basic clutch operation. Then there's a note about transmission noise being normal when the clutch is engaged, like when idling in neutral. But that's more about the transmission than the clutch pedal itself.\n\nNext, there's a section about climbing steep hills. It mentions shifting into a lower gear with 4L engaged. Not directly about the clutch pedal, but maybe about gear shifting techniques.\n\nThe main part related to the clutch pedal is in the carpet safety section. It warns that improper carpet installation can interfere with the pedals. Specifically, if the carpet isn't secured, it might get under the clutch pedal, causing issues. Also, objects under the carpet could shift and affect pedal operation. The user should ensure the carpet is properly attached with grommets and check for any interference by pressing each pedal fully.\n\nSo the answer should focus on ensuring the carpet doesn't interfere with the clutch pedal. Also, when using the clutch, pressing it fully when shifting and releasing while accelerating. But the main safety point from the context is the carpet and objects under it affecting the clutch pedal. The user needs to check that the carpet is secure and nothing is blocking the pedal movement.\n</think>\n\nWhen paying attention to the clutch pedal, ensure the following:  \n1. **Proper Operation**: Fully press the clutch pedal before shifting gears, and as you release it, lightly press the accelerator pedal for smooth transitions.  \n2. **Carpet Safety**: Verify that the vehicle\u2019s carpet is securely attached using grommets to prevent it from slipping or interfering with the clutch pedal. Avoid placing objects under the carpet, as they could shift and obstruct pedal movement.  \n3. **Interference Checks**: After installing or re-installing the carpet, fully depress each pedal (clutch, brake, accelerator) to confirm there is no obstruction or interference.  \n4. **Normal Noise**: Be aware that some transmission noise (e.g., when the clutch is engaged) is normal and not indicative of a problem.  \n\nAlways follow manufacturer guidelines for carpet installation and maintenance to ensure safe clutch pedal operation.",
      "retrieved_chunks": [
        " Shifting Fully press the clutch pedal before shifting gears.  As you release the clutch pedal, lightly press the accelerator pedal.  You should always use FIRST gear when starting from a standing position.  Note: A certain amount of noise from the transmission is normal.  This noise can be most noticeable when the vehicle is idling in NEUTRAL with the clutch engaged (clutch pedal released), but it may also be heard when driving.  The noise may also be more noticeable when the transmission is warm.  This noise is normal and is not an indication of a problem with your clutch or transmission.\n\n Before Climbing A Steep Hill As you approach a hill, consider its grade or steepness.  Determine if it is too steep.  Look to see what the traction is on the hill side trail.  Is the trail straight up and down?  What is on top and the other side?  Are there ruts, rocks, branches or other obstacles on the path?  Can you safely recover the vehicle if something goes wrong?  If everything looks good and you feel confident, shift the transmission into a lower gear with 4L engaged, and proceed with caution, maintaining your momentum as you climb the hill.\n\n Carpet Safety Information Always use carpet designed to fit your vehicle.  Only use carpet that does not interfere with the operation of the pedal assemblies.  Only operate the vehicle when the carpet is securely attached by the grommets so it cannot slip out of position and interfere with the pedal assemblies or impair safe operation of your vehicle in other ways.  WARNING: If operating the vehicle without carpet in place the floor may become hot, and there is a risk of burns.  An improperly attached, damaged, folded, or damaged grommets may cause your carpet to interfere with the accelerator, brake, or clutch pedals and cause a loss of vehicle control.  To prevent SERIOUS INJURY or DEATH: ALWAYS securely attach your carpet using the grommets.  ALWAYS make sure objects cannot fall or slide into the driver\u2019s side floor area when the vehicle is moving.  Objects can become trapped under accelerator, brake, or clutch pedals and could cause a loss of vehicle control.  NEVER place any objects under the carpet (e.g., towels, keys, etc.).  These objects could change the position of the carpet and may cause interference with the accelerator, brake, or clutch pedals.  ONLY install carpet designed to fit your vehicle.  NEVER install carpet that cannot be properly attached and secured to your vehicle.  If the carpet needs to be replaced, only use manufacturer approved carpet for the specific make, model, and year of your vehicle.  If the vehicle carpet has been removed and re-installed, always properly attach carpet to the floor and check that the floor mat fasteners are secure to the vehicle carpet.  Fully depress each pedal to check for interference with the accelerator, brake, or clutch pedals then re-install the floor mats."

However, the DRLs will still be activated along with the front and rear marker lights in this scenario.\n\nThe context also mentions that the DRLs may be deactivated when the parking brake is engaged, and that for vehicles sold in Canada, the DRLs will automatically deactivate when the front fog lights are turned on.\n\nAdditionally, the context states that on some vehicles, the Daytime Running Lights may deactivate or reduce intensity on one side of the vehicle when a turn signal is activated on that side, or on both sides of the vehicle when the hazard warning lights are activated.\n\nHowever, the context does not explicitly state that the DRLs can be manually deactivated by the driver. The information provided suggests that the ability to deactivate the DRLs may be limited or controlled by the vehicle's design and features, rather than being a user-configurable option.\n\nTherefore, based on the given context, it is not clear if the DRLs can be deactivated by the driver. The ability to deactivate them may depend on the specific vehicle model and market regulations.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they can deactivate the Daytime Running Lights (DRLs). I need to look through the provided context to find the answer.\n\nFirst, the context mentions that DRLs are active under certain conditions. For automatic transmissions, they're on when low beams aren't on and the transmission is in any position. For manual, when the vehicle starts moving. Also, in Canada, DRLs deactivate when fog lights are on, and when parking brake is engaged. Also, when turn signals or hazard lights are active, DRLs might deactivate or dim.\n\nBut the user is asking if they can deactivate them manually. The context says that vehicles in Canada have a headlight switch with AUTO and ON but no OFF. When the switch is in parking lights position, headlights are off but DRLs and marker lights are on. However, there's a note that DRLs may deactivate when parking brake is engaged. But that's automatic, not manual. Also, the DRLs deactivate when fog lights are turned on. But the user might want to turn them off otherwise.\n\nWait, the context doesn't mention a manual OFF position for DRLs. The headlight switch doesn't have an OFF detent, so maybe there's no way to manually turn them off. Also, there's a mention of BeltAlert being deactivated by an authorized dealer, but that's a different system. The DRLs seem to be controlled automatically based on vehicle conditions. So the answer would be that you can't manually deactivate DRLs except in specific cases like using fog lights or parking brake. But the user might need to use the parking brake or turn on fog lights to turn them off. However, the question is whether they can deactivate them. The answer would be that they can't manually deactivate them except through those specific actions. Also, maybe the parking brake engagement deactivates them. So the answer is that DRLs can't be manually turned off except when certain conditions are met, like using fog lights or parking brake.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: For vehicles sold in Canada, Daytime Running Lights (DRLs) cannot be manually deactivated via a dedicated \"OFF\" switch. However, DRLs will automatically deactivate under specific conditions:  \n1. When the front fog lights are turned on.  \n2. When the parking brake is engaged.  \n3.

The heated steering wheel button is located on the center of the instrument panel below the radio screen, and within the Climate or Controls screen of the touchscreen.  When Remote Start is activated, the front and rear defrost will automatically turn on in cold weather.  The heated steering wheel and driver heated seat feature will also turn on if programmed in the Comfort menu screen within Uconnect Settings Press the heated steering wheel button once to turn the heating element on.  Press the heated steering wheel button a second time to turn the heating element off.  Did you know: voice command for climate may only be used to adjust the interior temperature of your vehicle.  Voice Command will not work to adjust the heated seats or steering wheel if equipped.  The engine must be running for the heated steering wheel to operate."

      "ground_truth_answer": "According to the context provided, to unlock all the doors using the key fob, you need to push and release the unlock button on the key fob twice.\n\nThe relevant information is:\n\n\"To unlock the driver's door, push and release the unlock button on the key fob once. To unlock all the doors, push and release the unlock button twice.\"",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking how to use the key fob to unlock all the doors. I need to look through the provided context to find the correct information.\n\nFirst, I remember the context mentions using the unlock button on the key fob. Let me check again. The first part says: \"Push and release the unlock button on the key fob once to unlock the driver\u2019s door, or twice to unlock all the doors.\" So, pressing the unlock button once unlocks the driver's door, and pressing it twice unlocks all doors. That seems straightforward.\n\nI should make sure there's no other method mentioned. The context also talks about Passive Entry, but the question specifically asks about using the key fob. The Passive Entry part is about the system detecting the key fob inside the vehicle, but the user wants to know about manually unlocking with the key fob. \n\nAnother thing to note is the mention of Uconnect Settings allowing all doors to unlock on the first push, but the default is once for driver's door and twice for all. The answer should probably stick to the standard method unless the question specifies using settings, which it doesn't. \n\nAlso, the key fob can be used up to 66 feet away and doesn't need to be pointed at the car. But the question is about the action itself, not the range. \n\nSo the answer is pressing the unlock button twice. I should present that clearly.\n</think>\n\nTo unlock all the doors using the key fob, **push and release the unlock button twice**. This action will unlock all doors, whereas pressing it once only unlocks the driver\u2019s door. The key fob does not need to be pointed at the vehicle, and it works within a range of approximately 66 feet (20 meters). Additionally, the Uconnect system can be programmed to unlock all doors on the first press if desired.",

        " To Lock/Unlock The Doors And Tailgate Push and release the unlock button on the key fob once to unlock the driver\u2019s door, or twice to unlock all the doors.  To lock all the doors, push the lock button once.  When the doors are unlocked, the turn signals will flash and the illuminated entry system will be activated.  When the doors are locked, the turn signals will flash and the horn will chirp.  Note: All doors can be programmed to unlock on the first push of the unlock button through Uconnect Settings The mechanical flip key can be used to lock or unlock the doors, tailgate, glove compartment, storage compartments (if equipped), and rear seatbacks.\n\n When any of these situations occur, after all open doors are closed, the FOBIK-Safe search will be executed.  If it detects a Passive Entry key fob inside the vehicle, the vehicle will unlock and alert the customer.  If Passive Entry is disabled using the Uconnect system, the key fob protection described in this section remains active/functional.  When a door is open and the interior lights are on, rotating the instrument panel dimmer control to the extreme bottom position will cause all the interior lights to turn off.  This allows the doors to stay open for extended periods of time without discharging the vehicle\u2019s battery.  Be sure the hood is fully latched before driving your vehicle.  If the hood is not fully latched, it could open when the vehicle is in motion and block your vision.  Failure to follow this warning could result in serious injury or death.  The doors have to be open and then closed in order for the vehicle to check for the presence of a key fob; the Key Left Vehicle feature will not activate until all of the doors are closed.  These alerts will not be activated in situations where the vehicle\u2019s engine is left running with the key fob inside.\n\n Your vehicle is equipped with a key fob which supports Passive Entry, Remote Keyless Entry (RKE), Keyless Enter \u2018n Go\u2122 (if equipped), and Remote Start (if equipped).  The key fob allows you to lock or unlock the doors and tailgate from distances up to approximately 66 ft (20 m).  The key fob does not need to be pointed at the vehicle to activate the system.  The key fob also contains a mechanical key.  When any of these situations occur, after all open doors are closed, the FOBIK-Safe search will be executed.  If it detects a Passive Entry key fob inside the vehicle, the vehicle will unlock and alert the customer.  If Passive Entry is disabled using the Uconnect system, the key fob protection described in this section remains active/functional.  The electrical components inside of the key fob may be damaged if the key fob is subjected to strong electrical shocks.  In order to ensure complete effectiveness of the electronic devices inside of the key fob, avoid exposing the key fob to direct sunlight.  Once a key fob is programmed to a vehicle, it cannot be repurposed and reprogrammed to another vehicle.  Only key fobs that are programmed to the vehicle electronics can be used to start and operate the vehicle.  Once a key fob is programmed to a vehicle, it cannot be programmed to any other vehicle.  The system uses a key fob, keyless push button ignition and a Radio Frequency (RF) receiver to prevent unauthorized vehicle operation.  Therefore, only key fobs that are programmed to the vehicle can be used to start and operate the vehicle.  The system cannot reprogram a key fob obtained from another vehicle.
