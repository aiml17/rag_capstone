      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the provided context, here are the key things to pay attention to regarding the clutch pedal:\n\n1. Fully press the clutch pedal before shifting gears. Pressing the clutch pedal all the way down is necessary when changing gears to prevent damage to the transmission.\n\n2. As you release the clutch pedal, lightly press the accelerator pedal. This coordination of the clutch and accelerator is important for smooth gear shifts.\n\n3. Certain noise from the transmission may be noticeable when the clutch is engaged (pedal released). This noise is normal and not an indication of a problem with the clutch or transmission.\n\n4. Ensure the carpet is securely attached and does not interfere with the operation of the clutch pedal. Unattached or improperly placed carpet could get stuck under the clutch pedal and cause a loss of vehicle control.\n\nIn summary, focus on fully pressing and properly releasing the clutch pedal during gear shifts, be aware of normal transmission noises, and ensure the floor carpet does not impact clutch pedal operation.",
      "generated_response": "When dealing with the clutch pedal, pay attention to the following:\n\n1. **Full depression and clearance** \u2013 Before you reinstall the floor mats, fully depress the clutch (as well as the accelerator and brake) to make sure nothing is interfering with its travel. Objects must not be able to fall or slide into the driver\u2011side floor area where they could become trapped under the pedals.\n\n2. **Proper shifting technique** \u2013 Always press the clutch pedal completely before you attempt to shift gears. When you release the clutch, do it smoothly while lightly applying the accelerator to match engine speed.\n\n3. **Normal transmission noise** \u2013 Some noise from the transmission is expected, especially when the vehicle is idling in neutral with the clutch engaged (pedal released) or when the transmission is warm. This noise does **not** indicate a problem with the clutch.\n\nBy keeping the pedal travel clear, using the correct press\u2011and\u2011release technique, and recognizing that a certain amount of transmission noise is normal, you\u2019ll ensure the clutch operates safely and reliably.",

      "ground_truth_answer": "To make your steering wheel heated, you need to locate the heated steering wheel button on the center of the instrument panel below the radio screen, or within the Climate or Controls screen of the touchscreen. Press the heated steering wheel button once to turn the heating element on. Press the button again to turn the heating element off. Remember, the engine must be running for the heated steering wheel to operate. Additionally, be cautious as the heating element can cause burns, especially if used for long periods, so individuals with certain physical conditions should be extra careful when using it. Do not place anything on the steering wheel that insulates against heat to avoid overheating.",
