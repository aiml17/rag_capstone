The context provided mentions that Automatic SOS is a hands-free safety service that connects you with help if the vehicle's airbags deploy. So, the key point here is the deployment of the airbags. \n\nLooking at the context again, the first sentence under Automatic SOS says it's triggered when the airbags deploy. The SOS Call button is for manually initiating a call, but the Automatic SOS is specifically linked to airbag deployment. The FAQs also mention what happens if you accidentally push the SOS button, but that's about the manual activation. The question is about Automatic SOS, not the manual SOS Call.\n\nSo, the answer should be that Automatic SOS is triggered when the airbags deploy. I need to make sure there's no other condition mentioned for Automatic SOS. The context doesn't mention any other triggers for the automatic feature. The manual SOS uses the button, but the automatic one is airbag-related. Got it.\n</think>\n\nThe Automatic SOS will be triggered when the vehicle\u2019s airbags deploy.

You need to fully press the clutch when shifting. Then, when releasing the clutch, you should lightly press the accelerator.

      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the context provided, the SOS Call button on the vehicle's overhead console has the following functionalities:\n\n1. Initiating an SOS call to an SOS operator:\n   - Pushing the SOS Call button will initiate a call to an SOS operator.\n   - The SOS Call system will transmit important vehicle information to the SOS operator, including the vehicle brand, last known GPS coordinates, and an indication that the occupant placed an SOS call.\n\n2. Cancellation of the SOS call:\n   - There is a 10-second delay before the SOS Call system initiates the call to the SOS operator.\n   - During this 10-second delay, the SOS Call can be canceled by pushing the SOS Call button again or by pressing the cancellation button on the device screen.\n   - Terminating the SOS Call will turn off the green LED light on the overhead console.\n\n3. Voice connection with the SOS operator:\n   - Once the SOS Call connection is established, the occupants can speak with the SOS operator through the vehicle's audio system to determine if additional help is needed.\n\n4. Emergency response assistance:\n   - The SOS operator may attempt to contact appropriate emergency responders and provide them with the vehicle's important information and GPS coordinates.\n\nIn summary, the SOS Call button allows the vehicle occupants to initiate an emergency call, communicate with the SOS operator, and potentially receive emergency assistance if needed.",

I need to look at the context provided to find the answer.\n\nFirst, the context says that the SOS Call button is used when someone needs emergency assistance.

During that time, you can cancel it by pressing the button again or using the cancellation button on the touchscreen. Once connected, the green LED light on the overhead console turns on. \n\nAlso, it mentions that the SOS button connects directly to SiriusXM Guardian\u2122 Customer Care for emergency help. The ASSIST button is different; it's for non-emergency services like Roadside Assistance. The key points here are the emergency connection, the 10-second cancellation window, and the direct link to the operator. \n\nI should make sure not to mix up the SOS and ASSIST buttons. The answer should focus on the SOS button's function in emergencies, the delay, and how to cancel. Let me put that together clearly.\n</think>\n\nThe SOS Call button is designed to connect you directly to an SOS operator (such as SiriusXM Guardian\u2122 Customer Care) in an emergency. When activated, it initiates a call after a 10-second delay to allow cancellation if triggered accidentally.
