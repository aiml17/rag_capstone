Pressing the clutch pedal all the way down is necessary when changing gears to prevent damage to the transmission.\n\n2. As you release the clutch pedal, lightly press the accelerator pedal. This coordination of the clutch and accelerator is important for smooth gear shifts.\n\n3. Certain noise from the transmission may be noticeable when the clutch is engaged (pedal released). This noise is normal and not an indication of a problem with the clutch or transmission.\n\n4. Ensure the carpet is securely attached and does not interfere with the operation of the clutch pedal. Unattached or improperly placed carpet could get stuck under the clutch pedal and cause a loss of vehicle control.\n\nIn summary, focus on fully pressing and properly releasing the clutch pedal during gear shifts, be aware of normal transmission noises, and ensure the floor carpet does not impact clutch pedal operation.",

Verify the prerequisites\n| Requirement | Details |\n|-------------|---------|\n| **Smartphone** | Android phone running **Android\u202f6.0 (Marshmallow) or higher** |\n| **Data plan** | An active cellular data plan (Android Auto uses your phone\u2019s data) |\n| **Android Auto app** | Download and install the **Android Auto** app from the Google Play Store (if it isn\u2019t already pre\u2011installed) |\n| **Compatible apps** | Music, navigation, messaging, etc., must already be installed **and you must be signed in** on the phone for them to appear in Android Auto |\n| **Cable** | Use the **factory\u2011provided USB cable** (or a high\u2011quality data\u2011capable cable) |\n| **Vehicle interface** | U\u2011Connect system with a media USB port (or wireless\u2011compatible vehicle for wireless use) |\n\n---\n\n### 2. Connect the phone to the vehicle\n1. **Plug the USB cable** into the **media USB port** of the vehicle (not the charging\u2011only port).  \n2. Connect the other end to your Android phone.\n\n> *If your vehicle supports wireless Android Auto, you can pair via Bluetooth/Wi\u2011Fi instead, but the wired method works for all compatible models.*\n\n---\n\n### 3. Launch Android Auto\n- **Automatic launch:** Android Auto will **launch immediately** as soon as the compatible phone is detected.  \n- **Manual launch:** If it doesn\u2019t start automatically, tap the **Android Auto icon** on the vehicle\u2019s touchscreen (this icon replaces the old \u201cPhone\u201d icon on the main menu bar).\n\n---\n\n### 4. Initial setup on the car display\n1. **Accept permissions** on the phone (e.g., access to contacts, messages, location, etc.).  \n2. Follow any on\u2011screen prompts to **grant Android Auto access** to your phone\u2019s features.  \n3. The Android Auto interface will appear on the U\u2011Connect touchscreen, showing **cards** for navigation, music, calls, messages, etc.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Use voice commands (VR)\n- **Steering\u2011wheel VR button:** Press and hold the **VR button** on the steering wheel.  \n- **Microphone icon:** Alternatively, press and hold the **Microphone icon** within the Android Auto UI.  \n- Speak natural language commands (e.g., \u201cNavigate to 123 Main St,\u201d \u201cPlay my \u2018Road Trip\u2019 playlist,\u201d \u201cCall Sarah\u201d).\n\n---\n\n### 6. Access compatible apps\n- The Android Auto app **displays all compatible apps** each time it launches.  \n- Ensure any music, navigation, or messaging apps you want to use are **installed and you\u2019re signed in** on your phone; they will then appear as cards or icons on the car display.\n\n---\n\n### 7. Optional: Wireless Android Auto (if supported)\n1. Make sure your phone and vehicle are **both Wi\u2011Fi and Bluetooth enabled**.  \n2. Pair the phone to the vehicle\u2019s Bluetooth (or follow the vehicle\u2019s wireless\u2011Android\u2011Auto pairing steps).  \n3. Once paired, Android Auto will connect **wirelessly** without the USB cable.\n\n---\n\n### Quick Checklist\n\n- [ ] Android\u202f6.0+ phone with data plan  \n- [ ] Android Auto app installed  \n- [ ] Compatible music/navigation/etc. apps installed & signed in  \n- [ ] Factory USB cable (or wireless\u2011compatible vehicle)  \n- [ ] Connect phone to media USB port  \n- [ ] Android Auto launches automatically **or** tap the Android Auto icon  \n- [ ] Accept permissions, then use touchscreen, steering\u2011wheel controls, or voice (VR) to operate  \n\n---\n\n**Result:** After completing these steps, Android Auto will project your phone\u2019s compatible apps onto the U\u2011Connect touchscreen, allowing you to control music, navigation, calls, messages, and more safely via touch, steering\u2011wheel buttons, or voice commands.",

      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the provided context, it seems that the ability to deactivate the Daytime Running Lights (DRLs) depends on the specific vehicle and the market it is sold in.\n\nFor vehicles sold in Canada, the context indicates that the headlight switch does not have an \"OFF\" detent. Instead, the headlights will be deactivated when the headlight switch is placed in the parking lights position. However, the DRLs will still be activated along with the front and rear marker lights in this scenario.\n\nThe context also mentions that the DRLs may be deactivated when the parking brake is engaged, and that for vehicles sold in Canada, the DRLs will automatically deactivate when the front fog lights are turned on.\n\nAdditionally, the context states that on some vehicles, the Daytime Running Lights may deactivate or reduce intensity on one side of the vehicle when a turn signal is activated on that side, or on both sides of the vehicle when the hazard warning lights are activated.\n\nHowever, the context does not explicitly state that the DRLs can be manually deactivated by the driver. The information provided suggests that the ability to deactivate the DRLs may be limited or controlled by the vehicle's design and features, rather than being a user-configurable option.\n\nTherefore, based on the given context, it is not clear if the DRLs can be deactivated by the driver. The ability to deactivate them may depend on the specific vehicle model and market regulations.",
