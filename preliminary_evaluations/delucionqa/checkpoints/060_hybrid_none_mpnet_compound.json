        " Automatic SOS \u2014 If Equipped Automatic SOS is a hands-free safety service that can immediately connect you with help in the event that your vehicle\u2019s airbags deploy.  Please refer to your provided radio supplement for complete information.\n\n SOS Call Push the SOS Call button on the overhead console.  Note: in case the sos call button is pushed in error, there will be a 10 second delay before the sos call system initiates a call to an sos operator.  To cancel the SOS Call connection, push the SOS call button on the overhead console or press the cancellation button on the Device Screen.  Termination of the SOS Call will turn off the green LED light on the overhead console.  The LED light located within the ASSIST and SOS buttons on the overhead console will turn green once a connection to an SOS operator has been made.  Once a connection between the vehicle and an sos operator is made, the sos call system may transmit the following important vehicle information to an sos operator: indication that the occupant placed an sos call.  The vehicle brand.  The last known GPS coordinates of the vehicle.  You should be able to speak with the SOS operator through the vehicle audio system to determine if additional help is needed.  Warning: always obey traffic laws and pay attention to the road.  ALWAYS drive safely with your hands on the steering wheel.  You have full responsibility and assume all risks related to the use of the features and applications in this vehicle.  Only use the features and applications when it is safe to do so.  Failure to do so may result in an accident involving serious injury or death.  Note: your vehicle may be transmitting data as authorized by the subscriber.  Once a connection is made between the vehicle\u2019s SOS Call system and the SOS operator, the SOS operator may be able to open a voice connection with the vehicle to determine if additional help is needed.  Once the SOS operator opens a voice connection with the vehicle\u2019s SOS Call system, the operator should be able to speak with the vehicle occupants, and hear sounds occurring in the vehicle.  The vehicle\u2019s SOS Call system will attempt to remain connected with the SOS operator until the SOS operator terminates the connection.  The SOS operator may attempt to contact appropriate emergency responders and provide them with important vehicle information and GPS coordinates.  WARNING: If anyone in the vehicle could be in danger (e.g., fire or smoke is visible, dangerous road conditions or location), do not wait for voice contact from an Emergency Services Agent.  All occupants should exit the vehicle immediately and move to a safe location.  Never place anything on or near the vehicle\u2019s operable network and GPS antennas.  You could prevent operable network and GPS signal reception, which can prevent your vehicle from placing an emergency call.  An operable network and GPS signal reception is required for the SOS Call system to function properly.  The SOS Call system is embedded into the vehicle\u2019s electrical system.  Do not add aftermarket electrical equipment to the vehicle\u2019s electrical system.  This may prevent your vehicle from sending a signal to initiate an emergency call.  To avoid interference that can cause the SOS Call system to fail, never add aftermarket equipment (e.g., two-way mobile radio, CB radio, data recorder, etc.)  to your vehicle\u2019s electrical system or modify the antennas on your vehicle.  IF YOUR VEHICLE LOSES BATTERY POWER FOR ANY REASON (INCLUDING DURING OR AFTER AN ACCIDENT), THE UCONNECT FEATURES, APPS AND SERVICES, AMONG OTHERS, WILL NOT OPERATE.  Modifications to any part of the SOS Call system could cause the air bag system to fail when you need it.  You could be injured if the air bag system is not there to help protect you.\n\n Connected Services SOS FAQs \u2014 If Equipped What happens if I accidentally push the SOS Call button on the mirror or overhead console?

      "generated_response": "**How to Jump\u2011Start Your Car \u2013 Step\u2011by\u2011Step Procedure and Safety Guidelines**\n\nBelow is a complete, safe method for jump\u2011starting the vehicle described in the provided material. Follow each step in order and observe every safety warning.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Prepare Both Vehicles (or the Booster Pack)\n\n| Action | Why It Matters |\n|--------|----------------|\n| **Apply the parking brake** on your car (and on the donor vehicle, if used). | Prevents the cars from moving while you work. |\n| **Shift transmission**: automatic \u2192 **PARK (P)**; manual \u2192 **NEUTRAL**. | Keeps the drivetrain locked. |\n| **Turn ignition to OFF** on both vehicles. | Ensures no electrical load is on the batteries while you connect cables. |\n| **Turn off all accessories** (heater, radio, lights, etc.). | Reduces the chance of sparks and limits current draw. |\n| **Park the donor vehicle** (or place the booster pack) so the jumper\u2011cable clamps can reach the battery posts, but **do not let the two vehicles touch**. | Prevents an unintended ground connection that could cause a short or injury. |\n| **Remove metal jewelry** (rings, bracelets, watches). | Avoids accidental electrical contact with the battery terminals. |\n| **Keep the hood open** and stay clear of the **radiator cooling fan** (it can spin on its own when the ignition is ON). | Prevents injury from moving fan blades. |\n\n---\n\n### 2. Identify the Correct Battery Post\n\n- The **positive (+) post** on the main battery is covered with a protective cap. **Lift the cap** to expose the post.\n- **Only use the positive post** on the main battery for the jump\u2011start. **Never use the supplemental battery** (if your vehicle has a Stop/Start system) \u2013 doing so can cause serious injury or death.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Safety Precautions Before Connecting Cables\n\n- **Do not use any booster source >\u202f12\u202fV** (including \u201cfast chargers\u201d or high\u2011voltage portable packs).  \n- **Do not let the cable clamps touch each other** at any time.  \n- **Keep flames, sparks, and smoking materials away** from the battery \u2013 hydrogen gas from the battery is flammable and explosive.  \n- **Wash your hands** after handling the battery, as terminals contain lead compounds.  \n- **If a fast charger is being used**, disconnect both vehicle battery cables before attaching the charger; **do not use a fast charger to provide starting power**.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Connect the Jumper Cables (or Booster Pack)\n\n1. **Red (positive) clamp** \u2192 **Positive (+) post** on the **dead battery** (your car).  \n2. **Red (positive) clamp** \u2192 **Positive (+) post** on the **donor battery** (or on the booster pack\u2019s positive terminal).  \n3. **Black (negative) clamp** \u2192 **Negative (\u2013) post** on the **donor battery** (or on the booster pack\u2019s negative terminal).  \n4. **Black (negative) clamp** \u2192 **A solid, unpainted metal ground** on the **dead\u2011vehicle\u2019s engine block or chassis** (away from the battery). This reduces the risk of sparks near the battery.\n\n*Never connect the negative clamp directly to the dead battery\u2019s negative post.*\n\n---\n\n### 5. Start the Donor Vehicle (or Power the Booster Pack)\n\n- **If using another vehicle**, start its engine and let it run at idle for a minute or two.  \n- **If using a portable booster**, turn it on according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Attempt to Start Your Vehicle\n\n- With the cables still connected, **turn the ignition key to START** (or press the start button) on your car.  \n- If the engine turns over and starts, let it run for at least **30\u202fseconds** to allow the alternator to charge the battery.\n\n---\n\n### 7. Disconnect the Cables (in reverse order)\n\n1. Remove the **black (negative) clamp** from the engine block/chassis of the dead vehicle.  \n2. Remove the **black (negative) clamp** from the donor battery (or booster).  \n3. Remove the **red (positive) clamp** from the donor battery (or booster).  \n4. Remove the **red (positive) clamp** from the dead battery.\n\n*Make sure the unused ends of the cables never touch each other or any metal surface while you are disconnecting.*\n\n---\n\n### 8. After the Jump\u2011Start\n\n- Keep the engine running for **at least 15\u201320 minutes** (or drive the car) to fully recharge the battery.  \n- Verify that all electrical accessories work normally.  \n- If the car fails to start again after being turned off, the battery may be beyond recovery and should be inspected or replaced.\n\n---\n\n### **Critical Warnings & Cautions**\n\n- **Do NOT attempt to jump\u2011start a frozen battery** \u2013 it can rupture or explode.  \n- **Do NOT use a booster source >\u202f12\u202fV** \u2013 it can damage the battery, starter motor, alternator, or vehicle electronics.  \n- **Do NOT let the vehicles touch** while cables are connected \u2013 a ground path could cause a dangerous short.  \n- **Do NOT let the cable clamps contact each other** at any point.  \n- **Keep open flames and sparks away** from the battery at all times.  \n- **If you smell hydrogen or see gas bubbles**, stop immediately, ventilate the area, and wait before proceeding.\n\n---\n\n### Quick Checklist\n\n- [ ] Parking brake applied, transmission in P/Neutral, ignition OFF.  \n- [ ] All accessories OFF.  \n- [ ] Positive post uncovered, caps removed.  \n- [ ] Correct cable order (red\u2011red, black\u2011donor, black\u2011ground).  \n- [ ] No metal jewelry, no flames, no sparks.  \n- [ ] Donor vehicle running (or booster on).  \n- [ ] Engine of dead vehicle started, then run \u226530\u202fs.  \n- [ ] Cables removed in reverse order, keeping ends apart.  \n- [ ] Vehicle runs for 15\u201120\u202fmin to recharge battery.\n\nFollowing this procedure exactly will let you safely jump\u2011start your car while minimizing the risk of personal injury, battery explosion, or damage to either vehicle\u2019s electrical system.",

      "question": "What should I pay attention to for the clutch pedal?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the provided context, here are the key things to pay attention to regarding the clutch pedal:\n\n1. Fully press the clutch pedal before shifting gears. Pressing the clutch pedal all the way down is necessary when changing gears to prevent damage to the transmission.\n\n2. As you release the clutch pedal, lightly press the accelerator pedal. This coordination of the clutch and accelerator is important for smooth gear shifts.\n\n3. Certain noise from the transmission may be noticeable when the clutch is engaged (pedal released). This noise is normal and not an indication of a problem with the clutch or transmission.\n\n4. Ensure the carpet is securely attached and does not interfere with the operation of the clutch pedal. Unattached or improperly placed carpet could get stuck under the clutch pedal and cause a loss of vehicle control.\n\nIn summary, focus on fully pressing and properly releasing the clutch pedal during gear shifts, be aware of normal transmission noises, and ensure the floor carpet does not impact clutch pedal operation.",
      "generated_response": "**Things to watch for with the clutch pedal**\n\n1. **Use it correctly when shifting**  \n   * Press the clutch pedal **fully** before you move the gear lever.  \n   * As you release the clutch, **lightly press the accelerator** to match engine speed.  \n   * Always start from a stand\u2011still in **first gear**.\n\n2. **Make sure nothing interferes with its movement**  \n   * The floor carpet must be the correct type for your vehicle and **securely fastened with its grommets**.  \n   * Verify that the carpet (or any floor mat) does **not** block, lift, or shift under the clutch pedal.  \n   * **Never** place objects (towels, keys, etc.) under the carpet where they could get trapped by the pedal.\n\n3. **Check for proper pedal travel**  \n   * After installing or re\u2011installing carpet, **fully depress the clutch pedal** (and the brake and accelerator) to confirm there is no obstruction or abnormal resistance.\n\n4. **Noise is normal**  \n   * Some transmission noise can be heard when the vehicle is idling in neutral with the clutch **engaged** (pedal released). This is normal and not a clutch problem.\n\nBy following these points you\u2019ll keep the clutch pedal functioning smoothly and avoid any safety issues caused by carpet or foreign objects.",
      "retrieved_chunks": [
        " Shifting Fully press the clutch pedal before shifting gears.  As you release the clutch pedal, lightly press the accelerator pedal.  You should always use FIRST gear when starting from a standing position.  Note: A certain amount of noise from the transmission is normal.  This noise can be most noticeable when the vehicle is idling in NEUTRAL with the clutch engaged (clutch pedal released), but it may also be heard when driving.  The noise may also be more noticeable when the transmission is warm.  This noise is normal and is not an indication of a problem with your clutch or transmission.\n\n Before Climbing A Steep Hill As you approach a hill, consider its grade or steepness.  Determine if it is too steep.  Look to see what the traction is on the hill side trail.  Is the trail straight up and down?  What is on top and the other side?  Are there ruts, rocks, branches or other obstacles on the path?  Can you safely recover the vehicle if something goes wrong?  If everything looks good and you feel confident, shift the transmission into a lower gear with 4L engaged, and proceed with caution, maintaining your momentum as you climb the hill.\n\n Carpet Safety Information Always use carpet designed to fit your vehicle.  Only use carpet that does not interfere with the operation of the pedal assemblies.  Only operate the vehicle when the carpet is securely attached by the grommets so it cannot slip out of position and interfere with the pedal assemblies or impair safe operation of your vehicle in other ways.  WARNING: If operating the vehicle without carpet in place the floor may become hot, and there is a risk of burns.  An improperly attached, damaged, folded, or damaged grommets may cause your carpet to interfere with the accelerator, brake, or clutch pedals and cause a loss of vehicle control.  To prevent SERIOUS INJURY or DEATH: ALWAYS securely attach your carpet using the grommets.  ALWAYS make sure objects cannot fall or slide into the driver\u2019s side floor area when the vehicle is moving.  Objects can become trapped under accelerator, brake, or clutch pedals and could cause a loss of vehicle control.  NEVER place any objects under the carpet (e.g., towels, keys, etc.).  These objects could change the position of the carpet and may cause interference with the accelerator, brake, or clutch pedals.  ONLY install carpet designed to fit your vehicle.  NEVER install carpet that cannot be properly attached and secured to your vehicle.  If the carpet needs to be replaced, only use manufacturer approved carpet for the specific make, model, and year of your vehicle.  If the vehicle carpet has been removed and re-installed, always properly attach carpet to the floor and check that the floor mat fasteners are secure to the vehicle carpet.  Fully depress each pedal to check for interference with the accelerator, brake, or clutch pedals then re-install the floor mats."

        " To Lock/Unlock The Doors And Tailgate Push and release the unlock button on the key fob once to unlock the driver\u2019s door, or twice to unlock all the doors.  To lock all the doors, push the lock button once.  When the doors are unlocked, the turn signals will flash and the illuminated entry system will be activated.  When the doors are locked, the turn signals will flash and the horn will chirp.  Note: All doors can be programmed to unlock on the first push of the unlock button through Uconnect Settings The mechanical flip key can be used to lock or unlock the doors, tailgate, glove compartment, storage compartments (if equipped), and rear seatbacks.\n\n When any of these situations occur, after all open doors are closed, the FOBIK-Safe search will be executed.  If it detects a Passive Entry key fob inside the vehicle, the vehicle will unlock and alert the customer.  If Passive Entry is disabled using the Uconnect system, the key fob protection described in this section remains active/functional.  When a door is open and the interior lights are on, rotating the instrument panel dimmer control to the extreme bottom position will cause all the interior lights to turn off.  This allows the doors to stay open for extended periods of time without discharging the vehicle\u2019s battery.  Be sure the hood is fully latched before driving your vehicle.  If the hood is not fully latched, it could open when the vehicle is in motion and block your vision.  Failure to follow this warning could result in serious injury or death.  The doors have to be open and then closed in order for the vehicle to check for the presence of a key fob; the Key Left Vehicle feature will not activate until all of the doors are closed.  These alerts will not be activated in situations where the vehicle\u2019s engine is left running with the key fob inside.\n\n Your vehicle is equipped with a key fob which supports Passive Entry, Remote Keyless Entry (RKE), Keyless Enter \u2018n Go\u2122 (if equipped), and Remote Start (if equipped).  The key fob allows you to lock or unlock the doors and tailgate from distances up to approximately 66 ft (20 m).  The key fob does not need to be pointed at the vehicle to activate the system.  The key fob also contains a mechanical key.  When any of these situations occur, after all open doors are closed, the FOBIK-Safe search will be executed.  If it detects a Passive Entry key fob inside the vehicle, the vehicle will unlock and alert the customer.  If Passive Entry is disabled using the Uconnect system, the key fob protection described in this section remains active/functional.  The electrical components inside of the key fob may be damaged if the key fob is subjected to strong electrical shocks.  In order to ensure complete effectiveness of the electronic devices inside of the key fob, avoid exposing the key fob to direct sunlight.  Once a key fob is programmed to a vehicle, it cannot be repurposed and reprogrammed to another vehicle.  Only key fobs that are programmed to the vehicle electronics can be used to start and operate the vehicle.  Once a key fob is programmed to a vehicle, it cannot be programmed to any other vehicle.  The system uses a key fob, keyless push button ignition and a Radio Frequency (RF) receiver to prevent unauthorized vehicle operation.  Therefore, only key fobs that are programmed to the vehicle can be used to start and operate the vehicle.  The system cannot reprogram a key fob obtained from another vehicle.

Power Window Switches Never leave children unattended in a vehicle, and do not let children play with power windows.  Do not leave the key fob in or near the vehicle, or in a location accessible to children.  Occupants, particularly unattended children, can become entrapped by the windows while operating the power window switches.  Such entrapment may result in serious injury or death.  The power window switches will remain active for up to 10 minutes after the ignition is placed in the OFF position.  Opening either front door will cancel this feature.  There are window switches located on the rear of the center console for the rear passenger windows.\n\n Auto-Down Feature The driver door power window switch and the front passenger door power window switch have an Auto-Down feature.  Push the window switch down, past the detent, and release and the window will go down automatically.  To open the window part way, push the window switch down briefly, without going past the detent, and release it when you want the window to stop.  To stop the window from going all the way down during the Auto-Down operation, pull up on the switch briefly.  WARNING: There is no anti-pinch protection when the window is almost closed.  Be sure to clear all objects from the window before closing.\n\n Power Door Locks \u2014 If Equipped The power door lock switch is located on each front door panel.  Push the switch forward to unlock the doors, and rearward to lock the doors.  WARNING: For personal security reasons and safety in a collision, lock the vehicle doors when you drive, as well as when you park and exit the vehicle.  When exiting the vehicle, always place the ignition in the OFF position and remove the key from the vehicle.  Unsupervised use of vehicle equipment may cause severe personal injuries and death.  Never leave children alone in a vehicle, or with access to an unlocked vehicle.  Allowing children to be in a vehicle unattended is dangerous for a number of reasons.  A child or others could be seriously or fatally injured.  Children should be warned not to touch the parking brake, brake pedal or the gear selector.  Do not leave the key fob in or near the vehicle or in a location accessible to children.  A child could operate power windows, other controls, or move the vehicle."
