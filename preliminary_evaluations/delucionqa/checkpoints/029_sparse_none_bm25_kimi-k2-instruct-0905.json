      "ground_truth_answer": "To jump start the car, you should follow these steps:\n\n- Prepare for jump starting by applying the parking brake, shifting the transmission into PARK or NEUTRAL, turning off the ignition, and all electrical accessories.\n- Make sure the vehicle providing the jump start is parked within reach of the jumper cables, with the ignition turned OFF.\n- Only use the positive battery post on the main battery to jump start your vehicle.\n- Avoid using a booster battery greater than 12 Volts.\n- Ensure that cable clamps do not touch each other.\n- Lift up the protective cap on the positive battery post to gain access.\n- Do not allow vehicles to touch each other.\n- Avoid the radiator cooling fan when the hood is raised.\n- Remove any metal jewelry that could make inadvertent electrical contact.\n- Keep open flames or sparks away from the battery.\n\nAfter following these preparations, you can proceed with the jump starting procedure.",
      "generated_response": "To jump start the car, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prepare the vehicle**: Apply the parking brake, shift the automatic transmission into PARK (or NEUTRAL for manual), and turn the ignition OFF. Turn off all electrical accessories.\n\n2. **Position the donor vehicle** (if using one): Park it within jumper cable reach, apply its parking brake, and ensure its ignition is OFF. **Do not let the vehicles touch.**\n\n3. **Access the battery**: The main battery is in the right rear of the engine compartment. Remove the protective cap from the **positive (+) post**\u2014**use only this post for jump starting**. **Never use the supplemental battery** if your vehicle has Stop/Start.\n\n4. **Connect jumper cables safely**:  \n   - **Positive (+)** to the main battery\u2019s positive post.  \n   - **Negative (\u2013)** to a grounded metal surface away from the battery.  \n   - **Ensure clamps do not touch each other or any metal.**\n\n5. **Safety precautions**:  \n   - **No flames/sparks** near the battery.  \n   - **Do not use a booster >12V**.  \n   - **Remove metal jewelry**.  \n   - **Avoid the radiator fan** (can start anytime).  \n   - **Wash hands after handling** (battery contains lead/sulfuric acid).\n\n6. **Start the donor car**, then yours.

      "question": "What should I pay attention to for the clutch pedal?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the provided context, here are the key things to pay attention to regarding the clutch pedal:\n\n1. Fully press the clutch pedal before shifting gears. Pressing the clutch pedal all the way down is necessary when changing gears to prevent damage to the transmission.\n\n2. As you release the clutch pedal, lightly press the accelerator pedal. This coordination of the clutch and accelerator is important for smooth gear shifts.\n\n3. Certain noise from the transmission may be noticeable when the clutch is engaged (pedal released). This noise is normal and not an indication of a problem with the clutch or transmission.\n\n4. Ensure the carpet is securely attached and does not interfere with the operation of the clutch pedal. Unattached or improperly placed carpet could get stuck under the clutch pedal and cause a loss of vehicle control.\n\nIn summary, focus on fully pressing and properly releasing the clutch pedal during gear shifts, be aware of normal transmission noises, and ensure the floor carpet does not impact clutch pedal operation.",

      "question": "Can I deactivate the DRLs?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the provided context, it seems that the ability to deactivate the Daytime Running Lights (DRLs) depends on the specific vehicle and the market it is sold in.\n\nFor vehicles sold in Canada, the context indicates that the headlight switch does not have an \"OFF\" detent. Instead, the headlights will be deactivated when the headlight switch is placed in the parking lights position. However, the DRLs will still be activated along with the front and rear marker lights in this scenario.\n\nThe context also mentions that the DRLs may be deactivated when the parking brake is engaged, and that for vehicles sold in Canada, the DRLs will automatically deactivate when the front fog lights are turned on.\n\nAdditionally, the context states that on some vehicles, the Daytime Running Lights may deactivate or reduce intensity on one side of the vehicle when a turn signal is activated on that side, or on both sides of the vehicle when the hazard warning lights are activated.\n\nHowever, the context does not explicitly state that the DRLs can be manually deactivated by the driver. The information provided suggests that the ability to deactivate the DRLs may be limited or controlled by the vehicle's design and features, rather than being a user-configurable option.\n\nTherefore, based on the given context, it is not clear if the DRLs can be deactivated by the driver. The ability to deactivate them may depend on the specific vehicle model and market regulations.",

Initiating an SOS call to an SOS operator:\n   - Pushing the SOS Call button will initiate a call to an SOS operator.\n   - The SOS Call system will transmit important vehicle information to the SOS operator, including the vehicle brand, last known GPS coordinates, and an indication that the occupant placed an SOS call.\n\n2. Cancellation of the SOS call:\n   - There is a 10-second delay before the SOS Call system initiates the call to the SOS operator.\n   - During this 10-second delay, the SOS Call can be canceled by pushing the SOS Call button again or by pressing the cancellation button on the device screen.\n   - Terminating the SOS Call will turn off the green LED light on the overhead console.\n\n3. Voice connection with the SOS operator:\n   - Once the SOS Call connection is established, the occupants can speak with the SOS operator through the vehicle's audio system to determine if additional help is needed.\n\n4. Emergency response assistance:\n   - The SOS operator may attempt to contact appropriate emergency responders and provide them with the vehicle's important information and GPS coordinates.\n\nIn summary, the SOS Call button allows the vehicle occupants to initiate an emergency call, communicate with the SOS operator, and potentially receive emergency assistance if needed.",

      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the given context, here are some tips to help keep the air inside the vehicle fresh:\n\n1. Maintain the outside air intake: Ensure the air intake located in front of the windshield is free of obstructions, such as leaves. Blocked air intake can reduce airflow and potentially lead to issues like water drains getting plugged.\n\n2. Avoid excessive recirculation: Refrain from using the recirculation mode for extended periods without the air conditioning (A/C) on. Prolonged use of recirculation mode can lead to fogging and poor air quality inside the vehicle.\n\n3. Use the climate control system effectively: Utilize the Defrost or Mix mode and increase the front blower speed to clear any fogging on the windows. This helps maintain good visibility and air circulation.\n\n4. Manage the A/C system: If the A/C performance seems lower than expected, check the front of the A/C condenser (located in front of the radiator) for any dirt or insect accumulation. Clean the condenser with a gentle water spray to improve the A/C's effectiveness.\n\n5. Avoid excessive engine heat buildup: If the engine is experiencing severe and abnormal overheating, stop the vehicle, turn off the engine, and allow it to cool. Seek immediate service and a tune-up to manufacturer's specifications to address the issue, as this can help maintain proper air quality and prevent any potential odors.\n\nBy following these tips, you can help keep the air inside the vehicle fresh and improve the overall cabin environment.",
      "generated_response": "Keep the outside-air intake (at the base of the windshield) clear of leaves, snow, and ice so fresh air can flow into the cabin; avoid using Recirculation mode without A/C for long periods, because that traps moist interior air and can make the windows fog.",
