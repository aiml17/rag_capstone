      "ground_truth_answer": "The Automatic SOS will be triggered in the event that your vehicle's airbags deploy.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking when the Automatic SOS will be triggered. The context provided is about a vehicle's SOS system. Let me go through the context again to find the relevant information.\n\nFirst, the context mentions \"Automatic SOS \u2014 If Equipped\" as a hands-free safety service that connects you with help if the vehicle's airbags deploy. So, the key point here is airbag deployment. That seems like a trigger condition. \n\nThen there's a section about the SOS Call button on the overhead console. If someone pushes that button, it initiates a call. But there's a 10-second delay to prevent accidental activation. Also, there's a note about canceling the call by pressing the same button again or using the cancellation button on the device screen. \n\nThe user is asking specifically about when the Automatic SOS is triggered. The term \"Automatic SOS\" is mentioned in the first sentence, and it's tied to airbag deployment. The manual SOS call via the button is a separate action, but the automatic one is when the airbags deploy. \n\nI need to make sure there aren't other triggers. The context doesn't mention other conditions for Automatic SOS. It only says that Automatic SOS is triggered when airbags deploy. The manual SOS call is a different feature, initiated by pressing the button. \n\nSo the answer should be that Automatic SOS is triggered when the vehicle's airbags deploy. The user might confuse the manual SOS button with the automatic feature, but the question specifically asks about Automatic SOS. Therefore, the correct answer is airbag deployment.\n</think>\n\nThe Automatic SOS will be triggered **when the vehicle\u2019s airbags deploy**. This hands-free safety service automatically connects the vehicle to an SOS operator in such an event. Additionally, the SOS Call can also be manually initiated by pressing the SOS Call button on the overhead console, but this is a separate action from the automatic trigger.",

Instead, the headlights will be deactivated when the headlight switch is placed in the parking lights position. However, the DRLs will still be activated along with the front and rear marker lights in this scenario.\n\nThe context also mentions that the DRLs may be deactivated when the parking brake is engaged, and that for vehicles sold in Canada, the DRLs will automatically deactivate when the front fog lights are turned on.\n\nAdditionally, the context states that on some vehicles, the Daytime Running Lights may deactivate or reduce intensity on one side of the vehicle when a turn signal is activated on that side, or on both sides of the vehicle when the hazard warning lights are activated.\n\nHowever, the context does not explicitly state that the DRLs can be manually deactivated by the driver. The information provided suggests that the ability to deactivate the DRLs may be limited or controlled by the vehicle's design and features, rather than being a user-configurable option.\n\nTherefore, based on the given context, it is not clear if the DRLs can be deactivated by the driver.

Also, when turn signals or hazard lights are active, DRLs on one or both sides might deactivate or dim. \n\nBut the key part here is about deactivating DRLs manually. The context says \"The DRLs may be deactivated when the parking brake is engaged.\" So engaging the parking brake could deactivate them. Also, there's a mention of the headlight switch in Canada having AUTO and ON but no OFF detent. That suggests that in Canada, there's no OFF position for the headlights, which might relate to DRLs. However, the user is asking generally if they can deactivate DRLs. \n\nWait, there's also a part about BeltAlert being activatable or deactivatable by an authorized dealer, but the company doesn't recommend deactivating it. However, that's about BeltAlert, not DRLs. \n\nSo, based on the info, DRLs can be deactivated under certain conditions like parking brake engagement, using fog lights in Canada, or when turn/hazard signals are active. But the question is whether the user can deactivate them manually. The context doesn't mention a user switch or button to turn off DRLs. It only mentions automatic deactivation scenarios. The headlight switch in Canada doesn't have an OFF detent, which might mean you can't manually turn off the DRLs through the switch. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be that DRLs can't be manually deactivated by the user except under specific conditions like parking brake or fog lights. The user can't just turn them off like a regular light. The answer should reflect that based on the provided info.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: Yes, the Daytime Running Lights (DRLs) can be deactivated under specific conditions, such as when the parking brake is engaged, the front fog lights are turned on (for vehicles sold in Canada), or when turn signals/hazard warning lights are activated. However, there is no manual \"OFF\" position for DRLs on the headlight switch (especially in Canadian vehicles, which lack an \"OFF\" detent). D",

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking what's special about power windows based on the provided context. I need to go through the context and pick out the key points that highlight the unique features of the power windows.\n\nFirst, the context mentions that power windows allow movement with a button push. Then it talks about the location of the switches\u2014on the instrument panel below climate controls. The main thing here is the Auto-Down feature for the driver and front passenger doors. The instructions say to push the switch down past the detent to let the window go down automatically. That seems like a key special feature.\n\nAlso, there's a warning about not leaving children unattended because they might get trapped. The power window switches stay active for 10 minutes after turning off the ignition, and opening a front door cancels that. The rear windows have switches on the center console. The Auto-Down feature is mentioned multiple times, so that's probably the main special aspect. The power door locks are mentioned too, but the question is specifically about power windows. \n\nSo putting it all together, the special features are the Auto-Down function, the location of the switches, the 10-minute active period post-ignition off, and the safety warnings. But the most emphasized unique feature is the Auto-Down. The answer should highlight that the driver and front passenger windows have Auto-Down when pushed past the detent. Also, maybe mention the safety precautions as part of what's special because they're important aspects related to the feature.\n</think>\n\nThe special feature of power windows is the **Auto-Down function** available on the driver and front passenger door switches. By pushing the window switch down past a detent and releasing it, the window automatically lowers without needing to hold the switch. Additionally, the power window switches remain active for up to 10 minutes after the ignition is turned off, and safety warnings emphasize preventing child entrapment by avoiding unsupervised access to the windows.",
