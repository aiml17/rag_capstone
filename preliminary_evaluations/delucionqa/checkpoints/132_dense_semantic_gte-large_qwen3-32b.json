The user is asking specifically about Automatic SOS, not the manual SOS Call. The answer should be when the airbags deploy.

Voice connection with the SOS operator:\n   - Once the SOS Call connection is established, the occupants can speak with the SOS operator through the vehicle's audio system to determine if additional help is needed.\n\n4. Emergency response assistance:\n   - The SOS operator may attempt to contact appropriate emergency responders and provide them with the vehicle's important information and GPS coordinates.\n\nIn summary, the SOS Call button allows the vehicle occupants to initiate an emergency call, communicate with the SOS operator, and potentially receive emergency assistance if needed.",
