The context provided talks about the Automatic SOS being a hands-free safety service that connects you with help if the vehicle's airbags deploy.

The context also explains how to manually use the SOS Call button, but the Automatic SOS specifically is tied to airbag deployment. The note about the 10-second delay and canceling applies to when someone presses the SOS button, not the automatic one. The automatic system is activated automatically when airbags go off. There's no mention of other conditions for Automatic SOS besides airbag deployment.

Then, when releasing the clutch, they should lightly press the accelerator.

      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the provided context, it seems that the ability to deactivate the Daytime Running Lights (DRLs) depends on the specific vehicle and the market it is sold in.\n\nFor vehicles sold in Canada, the context indicates that the headlight switch does not have an \"OFF\" detent. Instead, the headlights will be deactivated when the headlight switch is placed in the parking lights position. However, the DRLs will still be activated along with the front and rear marker lights in this scenario.\n\nThe context also mentions that the DRLs may be deactivated when the parking brake is engaged, and that for vehicles sold in Canada, the DRLs will automatically deactivate when the front fog lights are turned on.\n\nAdditionally, the context states that on some vehicles, the Daytime Running Lights may deactivate or reduce intensity on one side of the vehicle when a turn signal is activated on that side, or on both sides of the vehicle when the hazard warning lights are activated.\n\nHowever, the context does not explicitly state that the DRLs can be manually deactivated by the driver. The information provided suggests that the ability to deactivate the DRLs may be limited or controlled by the vehicle's design and features, rather than being a user-configurable option.\n\nTherefore, based on the given context, it is not clear if the DRLs can be deactivated by the driver. The ability to deactivate them may depend on the specific vehicle model and market regulations.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they can deactivate the DRLs. I need to check the context provided.\n\nLooking through the context, there's a mention that DRLs may deactivate under certain conditions. For example, when the parking brake is engaged, or when front fog lights are on in Canada. Also, when turn signals or hazard lights are active, the DRLs might deactivate or reduce intensity. But the question is about deactivating them manually.\n\nWait, there's a part about BeltAlert being activatable or deactivatable by an authorized dealer, but that's a different system. The context doesn't mention anything about the user being able to manually turn off DRLs. It says DRLs are active when low beams aren't on and the transmission is in a certain position. Also, the headlight switch in Canada has AUTO and ON but no OFF. So maybe there's no OFF position to turn them off. \n\nSo the answer would be that you can't deactivate DRLs manually. They deactivate automatically under specific conditions, but there's no mention of a user switch or dealer option to turn them off. The only related deactivation is through the parking brake, fog lights, or signal lights. The user can't just turn them off themselves.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: The Daytime Running Lights (DRLs) cannot be manually deactivated by the user under normal driving conditions. They automatically deactivate in specific scenarios, such as when the parking brake is engaged, front fog lights are turned on (in Canada), or when turn signals/hazard lights are activated. Vehicles sold in Canada have a headlight switch with AUTO and ON positions but no OFF position, meaning there is no manual override to disable DRLs entirely. The only exceptions are the automatic deactivation conditions outlined in the context.",

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking what's special about power windows based on the provided context. I need to go through the context and pick out the key features that make them unique or noteworthy.\n\nFirst, the context mentions that power windows allow movement with a button push. But that's pretty standard for power windows. Then there's the Auto-Down feature on the driver and front passenger door switches. That's probably a key point. The Auto-Down lets the window go down automatically when you push the switch past a detent. Also, there's a warning about not leaving children unattended because they might get trapped. Another point is that the switches stay active for 10 minutes after the ignition is off, and opening a front door cancels that. Also, there's a way to stop the Auto-Down by pulling the switch up briefly. Plus, no anti-pinch protection when almost closed, so you need to clear objects before closing. The rear windows have switches on the center console too.\n\nSo the main special features are the Auto-Down function, the 10-minute active period after ignition off, the safety warnings about children, and the location of the switches. The answer should highlight the Auto-Down as the primary special feature, along with the safety aspects and the 10-minute active period.
