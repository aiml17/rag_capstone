      "question": "When will the Automatic SOS be triggered?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "The Automatic SOS will be triggered in the event that your vehicle's airbags deploy.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking when the Automatic SOS will be triggered. I need to look through the provided context to find the answer.\n\nFirst, the context mentions \"Automatic SOS \u2014 If Equipped\" and says it's a hands-free safety service that connects you with help if the vehicle's airbags deploy. So, the key trigger here is the airbags deploying. That's the main event that activates the Automatic SOS. \n\nThen there's also the SOS Call button on the overhead console. If someone pushes that button, it initiates an SOS call, but there's a 10-second delay to cancel it. However, the question specifically asks about Automatic SOS, not the manual SOS Call. The Automatic SOS is triggered automatically when airbags deploy, without any user action. \n\nThe context also explains that when the airbags deploy, the system connects to an SOS operator, transmitting vehicle info and GPS coordinates. So the answer should focus on the airbag deployment as the trigger for Automatic SOS. \n\nI need to make sure not to confuse Automatic SOS with the manual SOS Call. The user is asking about the automatic feature, which is activated by airbag deployment. The answer should clearly state that the Automatic SOS is triggered when the airbags deploy.\n</think>\n\nThe Automatic SOS will be triggered **when the vehicle\u2019s airbags deploy**. This hands-free safety service automatically connects the vehicle to an SOS operator, transmitting critical information such as the vehicle\u2019s make, model, and last known GPS coordinates. It is designed to activate without user intervention in the event of a collision severe enough to deploy the airbags.",

        " Automatic SOS \u2014 If Equipped Automatic SOS is a hands-free safety service that can immediately connect you with help in the event that your vehicle\u2019s airbags deploy.  Please refer to your provided radio supplement for complete information.\n\n SOS Call Push the SOS Call button on the overhead console.  Note: in case the sos call button is pushed in error, there will be a 10 second delay before the sos call system initiates a call to an sos operator.  To cancel the SOS Call connection, push the SOS call button on the overhead console or press the cancellation button on the Device Screen.  Termination of the SOS Call will turn off the green LED light on the overhead console.  The LED light located within the ASSIST and SOS buttons on the overhead console will turn green once a connection to an SOS operator has been made.  Once a connection between the vehicle and an sos operator is made, the sos call system may transmit the following important vehicle information to an sos operator: indication that the occupant placed an sos call.  The vehicle brand.  The last known GPS coordinates of the vehicle.  You should be able to speak with the SOS operator through the vehicle audio system to determine if additional help is needed.  Warning: always obey traffic laws and pay attention to the road.  ALWAYS drive safely with your hands on the steering wheel.  You have full responsibility and assume all risks related to the use of the features and applications in this vehicle.  Only use the features and applications when it is safe to do so.  Failure to do so may result in an accident involving serious injury or death.  Note: your vehicle may be transmitting data as authorized by the subscriber.  Once a connection is made between the vehicle\u2019s SOS Call system and the SOS operator, the SOS operator may be able to open a voice connection with the vehicle to determine if additional help is needed.  Once the SOS operator opens a voice connection with the vehicle\u2019s SOS Call system, the operator should be able to speak with the vehicle occupants, and hear sounds occurring in the vehicle.  The vehicle\u2019s SOS Call system will attempt to remain connected with the SOS operator until the SOS operator terminates the connection.  The SOS operator may attempt to contact appropriate emergency responders and provide them with important vehicle information and GPS coordinates.  WARNING: If anyone in the vehicle could be in danger (e.g., fire or smoke is visible, dangerous road conditions or location), do not wait for voice contact from an Emergency Services Agent.  All occupants should exit the vehicle immediately and move to a safe location.  Never place anything on or near the vehicle\u2019s operable network and GPS antennas.  You could prevent operable network and GPS signal reception, which can prevent your vehicle from placing an emergency call.  An operable network and GPS signal reception is required for the SOS Call system to function properly.  The SOS Call system is embedded into the vehicle\u2019s electrical system.  Do not add aftermarket electrical equipment to the vehicle\u2019s electrical system.  This may prevent your vehicle from sending a signal to initiate an emergency call.  To avoid interference that can cause the SOS Call system to fail, never add aftermarket equipment (e.g., two-way mobile radio, CB radio, data recorder, etc.)  to your vehicle\u2019s electrical system or modify the antennas on your vehicle.  IF YOUR VEHICLE LOSES BATTERY POWER FOR ANY REASON (INCLUDING DURING OR AFTER AN ACCIDENT), THE UCONNECT FEATURES, APPS AND SERVICES, AMONG OTHERS, WILL NOT OPERATE.  Modifications to any part of the SOS Call system could cause the air bag system to fail when you need it.  You could be injured if the air bag system is not there to help protect you.\n\n Connected Services SOS FAQs \u2014 If Equipped What happens if I accidentally push the SOS Call button on the mirror or overhead console?

      "question": "What should I pay attention to for the clutch pedal?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the provided context, here are the key things to pay attention to regarding the clutch pedal:\n\n1. Fully press the clutch pedal before shifting gears. Pressing the clutch pedal all the way down is necessary when changing gears to prevent damage to the transmission.\n\n2. As you release the clutch pedal, lightly press the accelerator pedal. This coordination of the clutch and accelerator is important for smooth gear shifts.\n\n3. Certain noise from the transmission may be noticeable when the clutch is engaged (pedal released). This noise is normal and not an indication of a problem with the clutch or transmission.\n\n4. Ensure the carpet is securely attached and does not interfere with the operation of the clutch pedal. Unattached or improperly placed carpet could get stuck under the clutch pedal and cause a loss of vehicle control.\n\nIn summary, focus on fully pressing and properly releasing the clutch pedal during gear shifts, be aware of normal transmission noises, and ensure the floor carpet does not impact clutch pedal operation.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking what they should pay attention to regarding the clutch pedal. I need to look through the provided context to find relevant information.\n\nFirst, in the context under \"Shifting Fully,\" it says to press the clutch pedal before shifting gears and release it while pressing the accelerator. Also, when starting, use first gear. Then there's a note about transmission noise being normal when the clutch is engaged, like when idling in neutral. That might not be directly about the clutch pedal itself but related.\n\nNext, under \"Before Climbing A Steep Hill,\" it mentions shifting into a lower gear with 4L engaged. Not sure if that's about the clutch pedal specifically, but maybe about gear shifting which involves the clutch.\n\nThen the \"Carpet Safety Information\" section is crucial here. It warns about the carpet interfering with pedals. The user should ensure the carpet is securely attached with grommets so it doesn't slip and block the pedals. Specifically, it says that improper carpet can interfere with the clutch, brake, or accelerator pedals. Also, never place objects under the carpet that might affect pedal operation. The warning emphasizes checking that the carpet doesn't interfere with the pedals by fully depressing each pedal after installation.\n\nSo putting it all together, the main points about the clutch pedal from the context are: ensuring the carpet doesn't interfere with it, properly attaching the carpet to prevent movement, checking for any objects under the carpet that might affect it, and making sure that when shifting gears, the clutch is fully pressed and released correctly. Also, the note about transmission noise when the clutch is engaged (pedal released) might be a minor point, but the main focus is on the carpet and pedal interference.\n</think>\n\nWhen paying attention to the clutch pedal, ensure the following based on the context:  \n1. **Secure Carpet Installation**: Use manufacturer-approved carpet designed for your vehicle, securely attached with grommets, to prevent it from shifting and interfering with the clutch pedal.  \n2. **Check for Interference**: After installing or re-installing the carpet, fully depress each pedal (including the clutch) to confirm there is no obstruction or interference from the carpet or objects under it (e.g., towels, keys).  \n3. **Avoid Objects Under Carpet**: Never place items under the carpet that could alter its position and block the clutch pedal.  \n4. **Proper Shifting Technique**: Fully press the clutch",
      "retrieved_chunks": [
        " Shifting Fully press the clutch pedal before shifting gears.  As you release the clutch pedal, lightly press the accelerator pedal.  You should always use FIRST gear when starting from a standing position.  Note: A certain amount of noise from the transmission is normal.  This noise can be most noticeable when the vehicle is idling in NEUTRAL with the clutch engaged (clutch pedal released), but it may also be heard when driving.  The noise may also be more noticeable when the transmission is warm.  This noise is normal and is not an indication of a problem with your clutch or transmission.\n\n Before Climbing A Steep Hill As you approach a hill, consider its grade or steepness.  Determine if it is too steep.  Look to see what the traction is on the hill side trail.  Is the trail straight up and down?  What is on top and the other side?  Are there ruts, rocks, branches or other obstacles on the path?  Can you safely recover the vehicle if something goes wrong?  If everything looks good and you feel confident, shift the transmission into a lower gear with 4L engaged, and proceed with caution, maintaining your momentum as you climb the hill.\n\n Carpet Safety Information Always use carpet designed to fit your vehicle.  Only use carpet that does not interfere with the operation of the pedal assemblies.  Only operate the vehicle when the carpet is securely attached by the grommets so it cannot slip out of position and interfere with the pedal assemblies or impair safe operation of your vehicle in other ways.  WARNING: If operating the vehicle without carpet in place the floor may become hot, and there is a risk of burns.  An improperly attached, damaged, folded, or damaged grommets may cause your carpet to interfere with the accelerator, brake, or clutch pedals and cause a loss of vehicle control.  To prevent SERIOUS INJURY or DEATH: ALWAYS securely attach your carpet using the grommets.  ALWAYS make sure objects cannot fall or slide into the driver\u2019s side floor area when the vehicle is moving.  Objects can become trapped under accelerator, brake, or clutch pedals and could cause a loss of vehicle control.  NEVER place any objects under the carpet (e.g., towels, keys, etc.).  These objects could change the position of the carpet and may cause interference with the accelerator, brake, or clutch pedals.  ONLY install carpet designed to fit your vehicle.  NEVER install carpet that cannot be properly attached and secured to your vehicle.  If the carpet needs to be replaced, only use manufacturer approved carpet for the specific make, model, and year of your vehicle.  If the vehicle carpet has been removed and re-installed, always properly attach carpet to the floor and check that the floor mat fasteners are secure to the vehicle carpet.  Fully depress each pedal to check for interference with the accelerator, brake, or clutch pedals then re-install the floor mats."

      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the provided context, it seems that the ability to deactivate the Daytime Running Lights (DRLs) depends on the specific vehicle and the market it is sold in.\n\nFor vehicles sold in Canada, the context indicates that the headlight switch does not have an \"OFF\" detent. Instead, the headlights will be deactivated when the headlight switch is placed in the parking lights position. However, the DRLs will still be activated along with the front and rear marker lights in this scenario.\n\nThe context also mentions that the DRLs may be deactivated when the parking brake is engaged, and that for vehicles sold in Canada, the DRLs will automatically deactivate when the front fog lights are turned on.\n\nAdditionally, the context states that on some vehicles, the Daytime Running Lights may deactivate or reduce intensity on one side of the vehicle when a turn signal is activated on that side, or on both sides of the vehicle when the hazard warning lights are activated.\n\nHowever, the context does not explicitly state that the DRLs can be manually deactivated by the driver. The information provided suggests that the ability to deactivate the DRLs may be limited or controlled by the vehicle's design and features, rather than being a user-configurable option.\n\nTherefore, based on the given context, it is not clear if the DRLs can be deactivated by the driver. The ability to deactivate them may depend on the specific vehicle model and market regulations.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they can deactivate the DRLs. I need to check the context provided.\n\nLooking through the context, there's a lot of repetition about DRLs. It mentions that for Canadian vehicles, the DRLs automatically deactivate when front fog lights are on. Also, when the parking brake is engaged, DRLs may deactivate. Additionally, when turn signals or hazard lights are activated, the DRLs on the respective sides might deactivate or dim. \n\nBut the question is about deactivating DRLs in general. The context says that the headlight switch in Canadian vehicles has AUTO and ON but no OFF. When the switch is in the parking lights position, the headlights are off, but DRLs are activated. However, if the parking brake is engaged, DRLs might turn off. Also, there's a mention of front fog lights turning DRLs off. But does that mean the user can manually deactivate them?\n\nWait, the user might be asking if there's a way to turn off DRLs completely. The context doesn't mention a manual switch to turn them off. It only describes automatic deactivation under certain conditions. For example, engaging the parking brake or using fog lights. There's also a mention of the headlight switch being in the parking lights position, but that activates DRLs. So maybe the only way to deactivate them is through those automatic conditions. \n\nAlso, there's a part about BeltAlert being deactivated by an authorized dealer, but that's a different feature. The answer should focus on DRLs. Since the context doesn't mention a user-activated switch to turn off DRLs, the answer would be that they can't be manually deactivated except under specific conditions like parking brake or fog lights. So the answer is no, unless those conditions are met.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: Yes, the Daytime Running Lights (DRLs) can be deactivated under specific conditions, but there is no manual \"OFF\" position for DRLs on the headlight switch. For vehicles sold in Canada, DRLs will automatically deactivate when:  \n1. The front fog lights are turned on.  \n2. The parking brake is engaged.  \n3. A turn signal or hazard warning lights are activated (causing DRLs to deactivate or reduce intensity on one or both sides).  \n\nOtherwise, DRLs operate automatically when the vehicle is in motion",

Persons who are unable to feel pain to the skin because of advanced age, chronic illness, diabetes, spinal cord injury, medication, alcohol use, exhaustion, or other physical conditions must exercise care when using the steering wheel heater.  It may cause burns even at low temperatures, especially if used for long periods.  Do not place anything on the steering wheel that insulates against heat, such as a blanket or steering wheel covers of any type and material.  This may cause the steering wheel heater to overheat.  The heated steering wheel button is located on the center of the instrument panel below the radio screen, and within the Climate or Controls screen of the touchscreen.  When Remote Start is activated, the front and rear defrost will automatically turn on in cold weather.  The heated steering wheel and driver heated seat feature will also turn on if programmed in the Comfort menu screen within Uconnect Settings Press the heated steering wheel button once to turn the heating element on.  Press the heated steering wheel button a second time to turn the heating element off.  Did you know: voice command for climate may only be used to adjust the interior temperature of your vehicle.  Voice Command will not work to adjust the heated seats or steering wheel if equipped.  The engine must be running for the heated steering wheel to operate."

That seems straightforward. The note also says that all doors can be programmed to unlock on the first push through Uconnect Settings, but the default is probably once for driver's door, twice for all. \n\nI should make sure there's no other method mentioned. The context also talks about Passive Entry, but the question specifically asks about using the key fob. So the answer should focus on pressing the unlock button twice. Also, the mechanical key is an option but the question is about the key fob. \n\nNo other steps are mentioned for unlocking all doors except pressing the unlock button twice.

        " To Lock/Unlock The Doors And Tailgate Push and release the unlock button on the key fob once to unlock the driver\u2019s door, or twice to unlock all the doors.  To lock all the doors, push the lock button once.  When the doors are unlocked, the turn signals will flash and the illuminated entry system will be activated.  When the doors are locked, the turn signals will flash and the horn will chirp.  Note: All doors can be programmed to unlock on the first push of the unlock button through Uconnect Settings The mechanical flip key can be used to lock or unlock the doors, tailgate, glove compartment, storage compartments (if equipped), and rear seatbacks.\n\n When any of these situations occur, after all open doors are closed, the FOBIK-Safe search will be executed.  If it detects a Passive Entry key fob inside the vehicle, the vehicle will unlock and alert the customer.  If Passive Entry is disabled using the Uconnect system, the key fob protection described in this section remains active/functional.  When a door is open and the interior lights are on, rotating the instrument panel dimmer control to the extreme bottom position will cause all the interior lights to turn off.  This allows the doors to stay open for extended periods of time without discharging the vehicle\u2019s battery.  Be sure the hood is fully latched before driving your vehicle.  If the hood is not fully latched, it could open when the vehicle is in motion and block your vision.  Failure to follow this warning could result in serious injury or death.  The doors have to be open and then closed in order for the vehicle to check for the presence of a key fob; the Key Left Vehicle feature will not activate until all of the doors are closed.  These alerts will not be activated in situations where the vehicle\u2019s engine is left running with the key fob inside.\n\n Your vehicle is equipped with a key fob which supports Passive Entry, Remote Keyless Entry (RKE), Keyless Enter \u2018n Go\u2122 (if equipped), and Remote Start (if equipped).  The key fob allows you to lock or unlock the doors and tailgate from distances up to approximately 66 ft (20 m).  The key fob does not need to be pointed at the vehicle to activate the system.  The key fob also contains a mechanical key.  When any of these situations occur, after all open doors are closed, the FOBIK-Safe search will be executed.  If it detects a Passive Entry key fob inside the vehicle, the vehicle will unlock and alert the customer.  If Passive Entry is disabled using the Uconnect system, the key fob protection described in this section remains active/functional.  The electrical components inside of the key fob may be damaged if the key fob is subjected to strong electrical shocks.  In order to ensure complete effectiveness of the electronic devices inside of the key fob, avoid exposing the key fob to direct sunlight.  Once a key fob is programmed to a vehicle, it cannot be repurposed and reprogrammed to another vehicle.  Only key fobs that are programmed to the vehicle electronics can be used to start and operate the vehicle.  Once a key fob is programmed to a vehicle, it cannot be programmed to any other vehicle.  The system uses a key fob, keyless push button ignition and a Radio Frequency (RF) receiver to prevent unauthorized vehicle operation.  Therefore, only key fobs that are programmed to the vehicle can be used to start and operate the vehicle.  The system cannot reprogram a key fob obtained from another vehicle.

      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking what's special about power windows based on the provided context. First, I need to go through the context carefully.\n\nThe context starts by explaining that power windows allow moving windows with a button push. The switches are on the instrument panel below climate controls. Then it mentions the Auto-Down feature for driver and front passenger doors. Pushing the switch down past the detent makes the window go down automatically. Also, there's a warning about children and safety, like not leaving them unattended. The switches stay active for 10 minutes after turning off the ignition. There are rear window switches too.\n\nThe Auto-Down feature is highlighted again in a separate section. It explains how to use it and how to stop it. The warning about no anti-pinch protection when almost closed is there. Then there's info about power door locks, but the question is about power windows.\n\nSo the key points about power windows are the Auto-Down feature, the location of switches, the 10-minute active period after ignition off, and the safety warnings. The special aspect here is probably the Auto-Down feature since it's mentioned specifically. Also, the ability to control windows with a button instead of manual cranks. But the question is asking what's special, so the Auto-Down is a notable feature. The answer should mention the Auto-Down and maybe the safety aspects, but the main special feature is the automatic operation when pushed past the detent.\n</think>\n\nThe special feature of power windows is the **Auto-Down functionality** on the driver and front passenger door switches. By pushing the window switch down past a detent and releasing it, the window automatically lowers completely. Additionally, users can briefly push the switch without passing the detent to open the window partially or stop the Auto-Down process by pulling the switch upward. This feature enhances convenience but includes safety warnings, such as the lack of anti-pinch protection when the window is nearly closed and risks associated with children operating the windows.",

        " The power windows feature allows for movement of the windows with the push of a button.  The power window switches are located on the instrument panel below the climate controls.  Push the switch downward to open the window and pull upward to close the window.  The driver door power window switch and the front passenger door power window switch have an Auto-Down feature.  Push the window switch down, past the detent, and release and the window will go down automatically.  Power Window Switches Never leave children unattended in a vehicle, and do not let children play with power windows.  Do not leave the key fob in or near the vehicle, or in a location accessible to children.  Occupants, particularly unattended children, can become entrapped by the windows while operating the power window switches.  Such entrapment may result in serious injury or death.  The power window switches will remain active for up to 10 minutes after the ignition is placed in the OFF position.  Opening either front door will cancel this feature.  There are window switches located on the rear of the center console for the rear passenger windows.\n\n Auto-Down Feature The driver door power window switch and the front passenger door power window switch have an Auto-Down feature.  Push the window switch down, past the detent, and release and the window will go down automatically.  To open the window part way, push the window switch down briefly, without going past the detent, and release it when you want the window to stop.  To stop the window from going all the way down during the Auto-Down operation, pull up on the switch briefly.  WARNING: There is no anti-pinch protection when the window is almost closed.  Be sure to clear all objects from the window before closing.\n\n Power Door Locks \u2014 If Equipped The power door lock switch is located on each front door panel.  Push the switch forward to unlock the doors, and rearward to lock the doors.  WARNING: For personal security reasons and safety in a collision, lock the vehicle doors when you drive, as well as when you park and exit the vehicle.  When exiting the vehicle, always place the ignition in the OFF position and remove the key from the vehicle.  Unsupervised use of vehicle equipment may cause severe personal injuries and death.  Never leave children alone in a vehicle, or with access to an unlocked vehicle.  Allowing children to be in a vehicle unattended is dangerous for a number of reasons.  A child or others could be seriously or fatally injured.  Children should be warned not to touch the parking brake, brake pedal or the gear selector.  Do not leave the key fob in or near the vehicle or in a location accessible to children.  A child could operate power windows, other controls, or move the vehicle."
