      "question": "When will the Automatic SOS be triggered?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "The Automatic SOS will be triggered in the event that your vehicle's airbags deploy.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking when the Automatic SOS will be triggered. I need to look through the provided context to find the answer.\n\nFirst, the context mentions \"Automatic SOS \u2014 If Equipped\" and describes it as a hands-free safety service that connects you with help if the vehicle\u2019s airbags deploy. So, the key trigger here is the airbags deploying. That's the main condition for the Automatic SOS to activate automatically.\n\nThen, there's also the SOS Call button on the overhead console. If someone manually presses that button, it initiates an SOS call. But there's a 10-second delay to prevent accidental activation. However, the question specifically asks about the Automatic SOS, which I think refers to the automatic triggering when airbags deploy, not the manual button press. The manual SOS call is a separate feature, even though it's part of the same system.\n\nThe context also explains that the Automatic SOS is triggered when airbags deploy. The manual SOS button is for when someone presses it, but that's not automatic. The user is asking about the automatic feature, so the answer should focus on the airbag deployment scenario.\n\nI need to make sure there's no other trigger mentioned. The FAQs mention that pushing the SOS button accidentally is handled with a 10-second delay, but that's for manual activation. The automatic part is only when airbags deploy. The warning about exiting the vehicle if in danger is advice, not a trigger.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the Automatic SOS is triggered automatically when the airbags in the vehicle deploy. That's the only scenario mentioned for the automatic activation. The manual SOS call is a different function, even though it's part of the same system.\n</think>\n\nThe Automatic SOS will be triggered **when the vehicle\u2019s airbags deploy**. This is the automatic activation condition described in the context. Additionally, the SOS system can also be manually initiated by pressing the SOS Call button on the overhead console, but this is a separate manual action (not automatic). The automatic feature specifically activates in response to airbag deployment.",

      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the provided context, it seems that the ability to deactivate the Daytime Running Lights (DRLs) depends on the specific vehicle and the market it is sold in.\n\nFor vehicles sold in Canada, the context indicates that the headlight switch does not have an \"OFF\" detent. Instead, the headlights will be deactivated when the headlight switch is placed in the parking lights position. However, the DRLs will still be activated along with the front and rear marker lights in this scenario.\n\nThe context also mentions that the DRLs may be deactivated when the parking brake is engaged, and that for vehicles sold in Canada, the DRLs will automatically deactivate when the front fog lights are turned on.\n\nAdditionally, the context states that on some vehicles, the Daytime Running Lights may deactivate or reduce intensity on one side of the vehicle when a turn signal is activated on that side, or on both sides of the vehicle when the hazard warning lights are activated.\n\nHowever, the context does not explicitly state that the DRLs can be manually deactivated by the driver. The information provided suggests that the ability to deactivate the DRLs may be limited or controlled by the vehicle's design and features, rather than being a user-configurable option.\n\nTherefore, based on the given context, it is not clear if the DRLs can be deactivated by the driver. The ability to deactivate them may depend on the specific vehicle model and market regulations.",
      "generated_response": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they can deactivate the DRLs. I need to look through the provided context to find the answer.\n\nFirst, the context mentions that DRLs are in a dedicated position below the headlight assembly. Then, there's a part about BeltAlert being activatable or deactivatable by an authorized dealer, but FCA doesn't recommend deactivating it. Wait, that's about BeltAlert, not DRLs. Let me check again.\n\nLooking through the DRL sections: The DRLs are active under certain conditions like when low beams aren't on. There's a note about Canada where DRLs deactivate when fog lights are on. Also, when parking brake is engaged, DRLs may deactivate. But the user is asking if they can deactivate them manually.\n\nThe context doesn't mention anything about the user being able to deactivate DRLs themselves. It talks about the headlight switch having AUTO and ON positions but no OFF for Canadian vehicles. So maybe in Canada, you can't turn them off via the switch. Also, the only mention of deactivation is automatic, like when using fog lights or parking brake. There's no mention of a switch or setting to manually turn off DRLs. The BeltAlert part is separate. So the answer would be that you can't deactivate DRLs manually; they deactivate under specific conditions automatically. Unless there's a dealer option, but the context only mentions BeltAlert being dealer-deactivatable. So probably, the answer is no, you can't deactivate DRLs yourself.\n</think>\n\nAnswer: The context does not indicate that Daytime Running Lights (DRLs) can be manually deactivated by the vehicle owner. DRLs automatically deactivate under specific conditions, such as when the front fog lights are turned on (in Canadian vehicles), when the parking brake is engaged, or when turn signals/hazard lights are activated. For vehicles sold in Canada, the headlight switch includes an AUTO position but no OFF detent for DRLs. There is no mention of a user-accessible option to disable DRLs. If deactivation is required, consult an authorized dealer, though this is not explicitly stated for DRLs (only mentioned for BeltAlert).",

That's the basic function, but there's more. The Auto-Down feature is highlighted a few times. Specifically, the driver and front passenger doors have this feature where pushing the switch past a detent makes the window go down automatically. That's a special feature because not all power windows have auto functions.\n\nAlso, there's a mention of the switches remaining active for 10 minutes after the ignition is off. That's a safety feature but also a special aspect. The warning about children and the anti-pinch protection note are important safety points. The ability to stop the Auto-Down by pulling the switch up briefly is another unique function. Plus, the location of the switches on the instrument panel and rear console for rear windows adds to the convenience.\n\nPutting this together, the main special features are the Auto-Down function, the 10-minute active period post-ignition off, and the safety warnings.

Most notably, the **driver and front passenger door switches include an Auto-Down feature**: pushing the switch down past a detent and releasing it causes the window to descend automatically. Additionally, the window switches remain active for up to **10 minutes after the ignition is turned off**, though this is canceled if either front door is opened. Safety warnings emphasize avoiding child access to prevent entrapment, and the ability to stop the Auto-Down function by briefly pulling the switch upward adds user control. Rear passenger windows are operated via switches on the center console.",
