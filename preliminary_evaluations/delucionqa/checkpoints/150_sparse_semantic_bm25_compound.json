Prepare the vehicles\n1. **Park the donor vehicle** so that its battery is within reach of the jumper cables attached to your car.  \n2. **Engage the parking brakes** on both vehicles.  \n3. **Turn the ignition OFF** on your car (the one that needs a jump).  \n\n### 2. Position the transmission\n- **Automatic transmission:** Shift to **PARK (P)**.  \n- **Manual transmission:** Shift to **NEUTRAL**.  \n\n### 3. Locate the correct battery post\n- Your car\u2019s main battery is in the **right\u2011rear of the engine compartment**.  \n- If the vehicle has a **Stop/Start system**, it will have **two batteries**; you still use the **positive post on the main battery** for the jump\u2011start.  \n\n### 4. Connect the jumper cables (safely)\n1. **Red (positive) clamp** \u2192 positive post on the **donor** battery.  \n2. **Red (positive) clamp** \u2192 **positive post on your car\u2019s main battery**.  \n3. **Black (negative) clamp** \u2192 negative post on the **donor** battery.  \n4. **Black (negative) clamp** \u2192 a clean, unpainted metal surface on your car\u2019s chassis (ground). **Do NOT connect to the supplemental battery or any other negative post** \u2013 the warning explicitly states that using the supplemental battery can cause serious injury or death.  \n\n### 5. Start the donor vehicle\n- Let it run for a few minutes to allow its battery to charge yours.  \n\n### 6. Attempt to start your vehicle\n- Turn the ignition **ON** (the car can start anytime the ignition switch is ON).  \n- If it starts, let it run for a few minutes before disconnecting the cables.  \n\n### 7. Disconnect the cables (reverse order)\n1. Remove the black (negative) clamp from your car\u2019s chassis.  \n2. Remove the black (negative) clamp from the donor battery.  \n3. Remove the red (positive) clamp from your car\u2019s battery.  \n4. Remove the red (positive) clamp from the donor battery.  \n\n### 8. Final checks\n- Verify that all connections are secure and that the parking brake remains engaged.  \n- Drive the car for at least 15\u201320 minutes to allow the alternator to fully recharge the battery.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Key safety points to remember**\n- **Only use the positive battery post on the main battery** for the jump\u2011start.  \n- **Never connect to the supplemental battery** \u2013 doing so can cause serious injury or death.  \n- Keep the ignition **OFF** while attaching the cables; only turn it **ON** when you\u2019re ready to try starting the engine.  \n\nFollowing these steps will safely jump\u2011start your car according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.",

Pressing the clutch pedal all the way down is necessary when changing gears to prevent damage to the transmission.\n\n2. As you release the clutch pedal, lightly press the accelerator pedal. This coordination of the clutch and accelerator is important for smooth gear shifts.\n\n3. Certain noise from the transmission may be noticeable when the clutch is engaged (pedal released).

      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the provided context, it seems that the ability to deactivate the Daytime Running Lights (DRLs) depends on the specific vehicle and the market it is sold in.\n\nFor vehicles sold in Canada, the context indicates that the headlight switch does not have an \"OFF\" detent. Instead, the headlights will be deactivated when the headlight switch is placed in the parking lights position. However, the DRLs will still be activated along with the front and rear marker lights in this scenario.\n\nThe context also mentions that the DRLs may be deactivated when the parking brake is engaged, and that for vehicles sold in Canada, the DRLs will automatically deactivate when the front fog lights are turned on.\n\nAdditionally, the context states that on some vehicles, the Daytime Running Lights may deactivate or reduce intensity on one side of the vehicle when a turn signal is activated on that side, or on both sides of the vehicle when the hazard warning lights are activated.\n\nHowever, the context does not explicitly state that the DRLs can be manually deactivated by the driver. The information provided suggests that the ability to deactivate the DRLs may be limited or controlled by the vehicle's design and features, rather than being a user-configurable option.\n\nTherefore, based on the given context, it is not clear if the DRLs can be deactivated by the driver. The ability to deactivate them may depend on the specific vehicle model and market regulations.",

Engaging the parking brake, **or**\n2. Turning on the front fog lights (if your vehicle is a Canadian\u2011spec model), **or**\n3.
