Perform the jump start  \n\n1. **Start the donor vehicle** (or turn on the booster pack) and let it run a minute or two.  \n2. **Attempt to start the dead\u2011battery vehicle.**  \n3. If it starts, **keep the engine running** and let it charge for a few minutes.  \n\n---\n\n### 5. Disconnect the cables (reverse order)  \n\n1. Remove the negative (black) clamp from the grounded metal point.  \n2. Remove the negative clamp from the donor battery.  \n3. Remove the positive (red) clamp from the donor battery.  \n4.

Pressing the clutch pedal all the way down is necessary when changing gears to prevent damage to the transmission.\n\n2. As you release the clutch pedal, lightly press the accelerator pedal. This coordination of the clutch and accelerator is important for smooth gear shifts.\n\n3. Certain noise from the transmission may be noticeable when the clutch is engaged (pedal released).

Instead, the headlights will be deactivated when the headlight switch is placed in the parking lights position. However, the DRLs will still be activated along with the front and rear marker lights in this scenario.\n\nThe context also mentions that the DRLs may be deactivated when the parking brake is engaged, and that for vehicles sold in Canada, the DRLs will automatically deactivate when the front fog lights are turned on.\n\nAdditionally, the context states that on some vehicles, the Daytime Running Lights may deactivate or reduce intensity on one side of the vehicle when a turn signal is activated on that side, or on both sides of the vehicle when the hazard warning lights are activated.\n\nHowever, the context does not explicitly state that the DRLs can be manually deactivated by the driver. The information provided suggests that the ability to deactivate the DRLs may be limited or controlled by the vehicle's design and features, rather than being a user-configurable option.\n\nTherefore, based on the given context, it is not clear if the DRLs can be deactivated by the driver.

Cancellation of the SOS call:\n   - There is a 10-second delay before the SOS Call system initiates the call to the SOS operator.\n   - During this 10-second delay, the SOS Call can be canceled by pushing the SOS Call button again or by pressing the cancellation button on the device screen.\n   - Terminating the SOS Call will turn off the green LED light on the overhead console.\n\n3. Voice connection with the SOS operator:\n   - Once the SOS Call connection is established, the occupants can speak with the SOS operator through the vehicle's audio system to determine if additional help is needed.\n\n4. Emergency response assistance:\n   - The SOS operator may attempt to contact appropriate emergency responders and provide them with the vehicle's important information and GPS coordinates.\n\nIn summary, the SOS Call button allows the vehicle occupants to initiate an emergency call, communicate with the SOS operator, and potentially receive emergency assistance if needed.",
