      "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, you can change the desired speed when the Cruise Control is on. The context provided indicates that you can do this by:\n\n1. Pushing the SET (+) or SET (-) button when the vehicle has reached the desired speed. This will set the new desired speed.\n\n2. If the vehicle speed is below 20 mph (32 km/h) when you set the cruise control, the set speed will default to 20 mph (32 km/h).\n\n3. If the vehicle speed is above 20 mph (32 km/h) when you set the cruise control, the set speed will be the current vehicle speed.\n\nSo in summary, the instructions clearly state that you can adjust the desired speed by using the SET (+) and SET (-) buttons while the Cruise Control is active.",

However, it can be inferred that to change the desired speed, you would need to adjust your vehicle's speed and then push the SET (+) or SET (-) button again to set the new desired speed.",
