      "question": "Any tips about how to keep the air inside fresh?",
      "ground_truth_answer": "Based on the given context, here are some tips to help keep the air inside the vehicle fresh:\n\n1. Maintain the outside air intake: Ensure the air intake located in front of the windshield is free of obstructions, such as leaves. Blocked air intake can reduce airflow and potentially lead to issues like water drains getting plugged.\n\n2. Avoid excessive recirculation: Refrain from using the recirculation mode for extended periods without the air conditioning (A/C) on. Prolonged use of recirculation mode can lead to fogging and poor air quality inside the vehicle.\n\n3. Use the climate control system effectively: Utilize the Defrost or Mix mode and increase the front blower speed to clear any fogging on the windows. This helps maintain good visibility and air circulation.\n\n4. Manage the A/C system: If the A/C performance seems lower than expected, check the front of the A/C condenser (located in front of the radiator) for any dirt or insect accumulation. Clean the condenser with a gentle water spray to improve the A/C's effectiveness.\n\n5. Avoid excessive engine heat buildup: If the engine is experiencing severe and abnormal overheating, stop the vehicle, turn off the engine, and allow it to cool. Seek immediate service and a tune-up to manufacturer's specifications to address the issue, as this can help maintain proper air quality and prevent any potential odors.\n\nBy following these tips, you can help keep the air inside the vehicle fresh and improve the overall cabin environment.",
      "generated_response": "Keep the outside-air intake (at the base of the windshield) clear of leaves, snow, ice, or anything that could block airflow; this lets fresh outside air enter the cabin instead of trapping stale air inside.",

        "Outside Air Intake Make sure the air intake, located directly in front of the windshield, is free of obstructions, such as leaves.

In Winter months, make sure the air intake is clear of ice, slush, and snow. Window Fogging Vehicle windows tend to fog on the inside in mild, rainy, and/or humid weather.

Do not use the Recirculation mode without A/C for long periods, as fogging may occur. On the highways \u2014 slow down. In city traffic \u2014 while stopped, place the transmission in NEUTRAL (N), but do not increase the engine idle speed while preventing vehicle motion with the brakes.",
        "For Manual Climate Controls, if the system is in Mix, Floor or Defrost Mode, the A/C can be turned off, but the A/C system shall remain active to prevent fogging of the windows. If fog or mist appears on the windshield or side glass, select Defrost mode, and increase blower speed if needed. If your air conditioning performance seems lower than expected, check the front of the A/C condenser (located in front of the radiator), for an accumulation of dirt or insects. Clean with a gentle water spray from the front of the radiator and through the condenser.
